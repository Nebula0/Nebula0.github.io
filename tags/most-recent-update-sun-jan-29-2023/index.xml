      <description>First author: Benjamin Beauchesne
We present a new method to simultaneously/self-consistently model the mass distribution of galaxy clusters that combines constraints from strong lensing features, X-ray emission and galaxy kinematics measurements. We are able to successfully decompose clusters into their collisionless and collisional mass components thanks to the X-ray surface brightness, as well as using the dynamics of cluster members to obtain more accurate masses with the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies.</description>

      <description>First author: Ajay Bassi
Bimetric gravity is an interesting alternative to standard GR given its potential to provide a concrete theoretical framework for a ghost-free massive gravity theory. Here we investigate a class of Bimetric gravity models for their cosmological implications. We study the background expansion as well as the growth of matter perturbations at linear and second order. We use low-redshift observations from SnIa (Pantheon+ and SH0ES), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), the growth ($f\sigma_{8}$) measurements and the measurement from Megamaser Cosmology Project to constrain the Bimetric model.</description>

      <description>First author: Erick Past√©n
We characterize the peculiar velocity field of the local large-scale structure reconstructed from the $2M++$ survey, by treating it as a fluid, extracting the gradient and the divergence via different approximations. This reconstructed field is important for cosmology, since it was used to correct the peculiar redshifts of the last SNIA compilation Pantheon+. We conclude that the local velocity field can be described on average as a slightly contracting fluid, with intriguing implications for the ``Tilted Cosmology&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; model.</description>

      <description>First author: Kate Napier
Tension between cosmic microwave background-based and distance ladder-based determinations of the Hubble constant H0 motivates pursuit of independent methods that are not subject to the same systematic effects. A promising alternative, proposed by Refsdal in 1964, relies on the inverse scaling of H0 with the delay between the arrival times of at least two images of a strongly-lensed variable source such as a quasar. To date, Refsdal&amp;rsquo;s method has mostly been applied to quasars lensed by individual galaxies rather than by galaxy clusters.</description>

      <description>First author: Ramesh Mainali
We present new observations of sixteen bright ($r=19-21$) gravitationally lensed galaxies at $z\simeq 1-3$ selected from the CASSOWARY survey. Included in our sample is the $z=1.42$ galaxy CSWA-141, one of the brightest known reionization-era analogs at high redshift (g=20.5), with a large sSFR (31.2 Gyr$^{-1}$) and an $[OIII]$+H$\beta$ equivalent width (EW${\rm{$[OIII]$+H\beta}}$=730~\r{A}) that is nearly identical to the average value expected at $z\simeq 7-8$. In this paper, we investigate the rest-frame UV nebular line emission in our sample with the goal of understanding the factors that regulate strong CIII]$ emission.</description>

      <description>First author: Sunayana Bhargava
X-ray observations of galaxy clusters are impacted by the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a manner that is challenging to quantify, leading to biases in the detection and measurement of cluster properties for both astrophysics and cosmological applications. Using automated X-ray pipeline techniques, we introduce a new automated class for AGN-contaminated (AC) clusters in the XXL source detection software. The majority of these systems are otherwise missed by current X-ray cluster detection methods.</description>

      <description>First author: O. C. Jones
We present new {\em Hubble Space Telescope} WFC3/IR medium-band photometry of the compact elliptical galaxy M32, chemically resolving its thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars. We find 2829 M-type stars and 57 C stars. The carbon stars are likely contaminants from M31. If carbon stars are present in M32 they are so in very low numbers. The uncorrected C/M ratio is 0.020 $\pm$ 0.003; this drops to less than 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Melissa Shahbandeh
Supernova (SN) explosions have been sought for decades as a possible source of dust in the Universe, providing the seeds of galaxies, stars, and planetary systems. SN 1987A offers one of the most promising examples of significant SN dust formation, but until the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), instruments have traditionally lacked the sensitivity at both late times (&amp;gt;1 yr post-explosion) and longer wavelengths (i.e., &amp;gt;10 um) to detect analogous dust reservoirs.</description>

We use images collected with the near-infrared camera (NIRCam) on board the James Webb Space Telescope and with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to investigate multiple populations at the bottom of the main sequence (MS) of 47 Tucanae. The F115W vs. F115W-F322W2 CMD from NIRCam shows that, below the knee, the MS stars span a wide color range, where the majority of M-dwarfs exhibit blue colors, and a tail of stars are distributed toward the red.</description>

      <description>First author: I. Langan
We study the link between gas flow events and key galaxy scaling relations: the relations between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (the main sequence, MS), gas metallicity and stellar mass (the mass-metallicity relation, MZR) and gas metallicity, stellar mass and SFR (the fundamental metallicity relation, FMR). Using all star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the 22 MUSE fields of the MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) survey, we derive the MS, MZR and FMR scaling relations for 385 SFGs with $M = 10^8 - 10^{11.</description>

      <description>First author: Daichi Tsuna
Early-time light curves/spectra of some hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) give firm evidence on the existence of confined, dense circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding dying massive stars. We numerically and analytically study radiative acceleration of CSM in such systems, where the radiation is mainly powered by the interaction between the SN ejecta and the CSM. We find that the acceleration of the ambient CSM is larger for massive and compact CSM, with velocities reaching up to $\sim 10^3\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$ for a CSM of order $0.</description>

We study the statistical properties of O VI, C IV, and Ne VIII absorbers at low-$z$ (i.e., $z&amp;lt;0.5$) using Sherwood simulations with &amp;ldquo;WIND&amp;rdquo; only and &amp;ldquo;WIND+AGN&amp;rdquo; feedback and Massive black simulation that incorporates both &amp;ldquo;WIND&amp;rdquo; and AGN feedbacks. For each simulation, by considering a wide range of metagalactic ionizing UV background (UVB), we show the statistical properties such as distribution functions of column density ($N$), $b$-paramerer and velocity spread ($\Delta V_{90}$), the relationship between $N$ and $b$-parameter and the fraction of Lya absorbers showing detectable metal lines as a function of $N$(H I) are influenced by the UVB used.</description>

      <description>First author: Hiroki Nagakura
One of the greatest uncertainties in any modeling of inner engine of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is neutrino flavor conversions driven by neutrino self-interactions. We carry out large-scale numerical simulations of multi-energy, multi-angle, three-flavor framework, and general relativistic quantum kinetic neutrino transport in spherical symmetry with an essential set of neutrino-matter interactions under a realistic fluid profile of CCSN. Our result suggests that the neutrino heating in the gain region is reduced by $\sim 50%$ due to fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC).</description>

      <description>First author: G. Taylor
For the past decade, SALT2 has been the most common model used to fit Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves for dark energy analyses. Recently, the SALT3 model was released, which upgraded a number of model features but has not yet been used for measurements of dark energy. Here, we evaluate the impact of switching from SALT2 to SALT3 for a SN cosmology analysis. We train SALT2 and SALT3 on an identical training sample of 1083 well-calibrated Type Ia supernovae, ensuring that any differences found come from the underlying model framework.</description>

We present the star formation histories (SFHs) of early-type dwarf galaxies, dSphs and dEs, in the local universe within z=0.01. The SFHs of early-type dwarf galaxies are characterized by pre-enriched, metal-poor old stellar populations, absence of moderately old stars that have ages of a few Gyr. There are some differences in the SFHs of dSphs and dEs. In particular, dSphs formed old ($\gtrsim10$ Gyr old) metal-poor stars $\sim2$ times more than dEs.</description>

We study the reconstructed deceleration parameter splitting the data in different redshift bins, fitting both a cosmographic luminosity distance and also assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, using the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernova data (SNIA). We observe tensions $\sim 2\sigma-3\sigma$ for different redshift and distance indicators if the full sample is used. However, those tensions disappear when the SNIA at $z&amp;lt;0.008$ are removed. If the data is splitted in 2 hemispheres according to our movement w.</description>

The Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension is one of the major open problems in modern cosmology. This tension is the discrepancy, ranging from 4 to 6 $\sigma$, between the $H_0$ value estimated locally with the combination of Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) + Cepheids and the cosmological $H_0$ obtained through the study of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.

Recent integral-field spectroscopy observations have revealed that thick- and thin-disk star-formation histories are regulated by the interplay of internal and external processes. We analyze stellar-population properties of 24 spiral galaxies from the AURIGA zoom-in cosmological simulations, to offer a more in-depth interpretation of observable properties. We present edge-on maps of stellar age, metallicity and $[Mg/Fe]$ abundance, and we extract the star-formation and chemical-evolution histories of thin and thick disks.</description>

We present extensive optical photometry of the afterglow of GRB 221009A. Our data cover $0.9 - 59.9$ days from the time of Swift and Fermi GRB detections. Photometry in $rizy$-band filters was collected primarily with Pan-STARRS and supplemented by multiple 1- to 4-meter imaging facilities. We analyzed the Swift X-ray data of the afterglow and found a single decline rate power-law $f(t) \propto t^{-1.556\pm0.002}$ best describes the light curve.</description>

Abundance matching studies have shown that the average relationship between galaxy radius and dark matter halo virial radius remains nearly constant over many orders of magnitude in halo mass, and over cosmic time since about $z=3$. In this work, we investigate the predicted relationship between galaxy radius $r_{e}$ and halo virial radius $R_{\rm h}$ in the numerical hydrodynamical simulations Illustris and IllustrisTNG from $z\sim 0$&amp;ndash;3, and compare with the results from the abundance matching studies.</description>

The dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies holds a wealth of information on the fundamental properties and interactions of the dark matter particle. In this paper, we study whether ultralight bosonic dark matter is consistent with the gravitational potential extracted from stellar kinematics. We use velocity dispersion measurements to constrain models for halo mass and particle mass. The posterior likelihood is multimodal. Particle masses of order $m\sim 10^{-22} {\rm{eV}}$ require halos of mass in excess of $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$, while particle mass of order $m \gtrsim 10^{-20}{\rm{eV}}$ are favored by halos of mass $\sim [10^{8} - 10^{9}] M_\odot$, with a similar behavior to cold dark matter.</description>

Dirac, in 1937 proposed the variation of coupling constants derived from his large number hypothesis. Efforts have continued since then to constrain their variation by various methods. We briefly discuss several methods used for the purpose while focusing primarily on the use of supernovae type 1a, quasars, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as cosmological probes for determining cosmological distances. Supernovae type Ia (SNeIa) are considered the best standard candles since their intrinsic luminosity can be determined precisely from their light curves.</description>

      <description>First author: Tibor Dome
On large cosmological scales, anisotropic gravitational collapse is manifest in the dark cosmic web. Its statistical properties are well known for the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, yet become modified for alternative dark matter models such as fuzzy dark matter (FDM). In this work, we assess for the first time the relative importance of cosmic nodes, filaments, walls and voids in a cosmology with small-scale suppression of power such as FDM.</description>

      <description>First author: Philip Mocz
We investigate cosmological structure formation in Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) with an attractive self-interaction (SI) with numerical simulations. Such a SI would arise if the FDM boson were an ultra-light axion, which has a strong CP symmetry-breaking scale (decay constant). Although weak, the attractive SI may be strong enough to counteract the quantum &amp;lsquo;pressure&amp;rsquo; and alter structure formation. We find in our simulations that the SI can enhance small-scale structure formation, and soliton cores above a critical mass undergo a phase transition, transforming from dilute to dense solitons.</description>

We investigate the first emergence of the so-called cold accretion, the accretion flows deeply penetrating a halo, in the early universe with cosmological N-body/SPH simulations. We study the structure of the accretion flow and its evolution within small halos with $\lesssim 10^8~{\rm M}_\odot$ with sufficiently high spatial resolutions down to $\sim 1 \ {\rm pc}$ scale. While previous studies only follow the evolution for a short period after the primordial cloud collapse, we follow the long-term evolution until the cold accretion first appears, employing the sink particle method.</description>

The metallicity distributions of globular cluster (GC) systems in galaxies are a critical test of any GC formation scenario. In this work, we investigate the predicted GC metallicity distributions of galaxies in the MOdelling Star cluster population Assembly In Cosmological Simulations within EAGLE (E-MOSAICS) simulation of a representative cosmological volume ($L = 34.4$ comoving Mpc). We find that the predicted GC metallicity distributions and median metallicities from the fiducial E-MOSAICS GC formation model agree well the observed distributions, except for galaxies with masses $M_\ast \sim 2 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, which contain an overabundance of metal-rich GCs.</description>

      <description>First author: N. Corso
GeV and TeV emission from the forward shocks of supernova remnants (SNRs) indicates that they are capable particle accelerators, making them promising sources of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs). However, it remains uncertain whether this $\gamma$-ray emission arises primarily from the decay of neutral pions produced by very high energy hadrons, or from inverse-Compton and/or bremsstrahlung emission from relativistic leptons. By applying a semi-analytic approach to non-linear diffusive shock acceleration (NLDSA) and calculating the particle and photon spectra produced in different astrophysical environments, we parametrize the relative strength of hadronic and leptonic emission.</description>

The next Galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) will be a unique opportunity to study within a fully multi-messenger approach the explosion mechanism responsible for the formation of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes. State-of-the-art numerical simulations of those events reveal the complexity of the gravitational-wave emission which is highly stochastic. This challenges the possibility to infer the properties of the compact remnant and of its progenitor using the information encoded in the waveforms.</description>

We report the discovery of an ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy, Pegasus W, located on the far side of the Milky Way-M31 system and outside the virial radius of M31. The distance to the galaxy is 915 (+60/-91) kpc, measured using the luminosity of horizontal branch (HB) stars identified in Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging. The galaxy has a half-light radius (r_h) of 100 (+11/-13) pc, M_V = -7.</description>

We present the star formation histories (SFHs) of early-type dwarf galaxies, dSphs and dEs, in the local universe within z=0.01. The SFHs of early-type dwarf galaxies are characterized by pre-enriched, metal-poor old stellar populations, absence of moderately old stars that have ages of a few Gyr. There are some differences in the SFHs of dSphs and dEs. In particular, dSphs formed old ($\gtrsim10$ Gyr old) metal-poor stars $\sim2$ times more than dEs.</description>

The nature of dark matter (DM) is an open question in cosmology, despite its abundance in the universe. While elementary particles have been posited to explain DM, compact astrophysical objects such as black holes formed in the early universe offer a theoretically appealing alternate route. Here, we constrain the fraction of DM that can be made up of primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M \gtrsim 0.</description>

Half of these new additions are located behind the Galactic plane; for most of them we have full X-ray coverage obtained through archival data from Swift/XRT, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR.</description>

We observe large variations in the burst rate, and report the first FRB 20200120E `burst storm&amp;amp;#39;, where the source suddenly became active and 53 bursts (fluence $\geq 0.04$ Jy ms) occurred within only 40 minutes.</description>

We present a new method to predict the line-of-sight column density (NH) values of active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on mid-infrared (MIR), soft, and hard X-ray data. We developed a multiple linear regression machine learning algorithm trained with WISE colors, Swift-BAT count rates, soft X-ray hardness ratios, and an MIR-soft X-ray flux ratio. Our algorithm was trained off 451 AGN from the Swift-BAT sample with known NH and has the ability to accurately predict NH values for AGN of all levels of obscuration, as evidenced by its Spearman correlation coefficient value of 0.</description>

We outline some conditions, that if not quite no go&#39;&#39; are no thanks&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, showing that changing the expansion history, e.g. employing dynamical dark energy, cannot reconcile disparate deductions of $H_0$ without upsetting some other cosmological measurement.</description>

We confirm emission line redshifts for 7 galaxies at $z=7.762-8.998$ using spectra at $\sim1-5\mu$m either with the NIRSpec prism or its three medium resolution gratings. For $z\simeq9$ photometric candidates, we achieve a high confirmation rate of $\simeq$90%, which validates the classical dropout selection from NIRCam photometry.</description>

Upcoming deep galaxy surveys with JWST will probe galaxy evolution during the epoch of reionisation (EoR, $5\leq z\leq10$) over relatively compact areas (e.g. $\sim$ 300,arcmin$^2$ for the JADES GTO survey). It is therefore imperative that we understand the degree of survey variance, to evaluate how representative the galaxy populations in these studies will be. We use the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) to measure the galaxy bias of various tracers over an unprecedentedly large range in overdensity for a hydrodynamic simulation, and use these relations to assess the impact of bias and clustering on survey variance in the EoR.</description>

Contamination from galaxy fragments, identified as sources, is a major issue in large photometric galaxy catalogs. In this paper, we prove that this problem can be easily addressed with computer vision techniques. We use image cutouts to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify catalogued sources that are in reality just star formation regions and/or shreds of larger galaxies. The CNN reaches an accuracy ~98% on our testing datasets.</description>

Large-scale cosmological simulations are an indispensable tool for modern cosmology. To enable model-space exploration, fast and accurate predictions are critical. In this paper, we show that the performance of such simulations can be further improved with time-stepping schemes that use input from cosmological perturbation theory. Specifically, we introduce a class of time-stepping schemes derived by matching the particle trajectories in a single leapfrog/Verlet drift-kick-drift step to those predicted by Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT).</description>

The recent searches for z&amp;gt;11 galaxies using the James Webb Space Telescope have resulted in an unexpectedly high number of candidate objects, which imply at least an order of magnitude higher number density of $z&amp;gt;11$ galaxies than the previously favored predictions. A question has risen whether there are some new types of contaminants among these candidates. The candidate sample of Yan et al. (2023a), totalling 87 dropouts, is the largest one, and we notice that a number of these candidates are point-like.</description>

We find significant systematics in their estimates depending on models and wavelength ranges considered. Using the full-spectrum fitting technique, we find that both $[Z/H]$ and age increase with mass as for local ETGs. Age and metallicity sensitive spectral indices independently confirm these trends.</description>

      <description>First author: Maksym Tsizh
In this work we test Wasserstein distance in conjunction with persistent homology, as a tool for discriminating large scale structures of simulated universes with different values of $\sigma_8$ cosmological parameter (present root-mean-square matter fluctuation averaged over a sphere of radius 8 Mpc comoving). The Wasserstein distance (a.k.a. the pair-matching distance) was proposed to measure the difference between two networks in terms of persistent homology. The advantage of this approach consists in its non-parametric way of probing the topology of the Cosmic web, in contrast to graph-theoretical approach depending on linking length.</description>

(Abridged) Galaxy clusters are a powerful probe of cosmological models. Next generation large-scale optical and infrared surveys will reach unprecedented depths over large areas and require highly complete and pure cluster catalogs, with a well defined selection function. We have developed a new cluster detection algorithm YOLO-CL, which is a modified version of the state-of-the-art object detection deep convolutional network YOLO, optimized for the detection of galaxy clusters.</description>

Much excitement surrounds the intense mass loss that seems to take place in some massive stars immediately before core collapse. However, occurring too late, it has a negligible impact on the star&amp;rsquo;s evolution or the final yields, which are influenced instead by the longer-term, quasi-steady mass loss taking place during H and He burning. Late-time observations of core-collapse supernovae interacting with the progenitor wind are one means to constrain this secular mass loss.</description>

Protoclusters of galaxies have been found in the last quarter century. However, most of them have been found through the overdensity of star-forming galaxies, and there had been no known structures identified by multiple spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies at $z&amp;gt;2.5$. In this letter, we report the discovery of an overdense structure of massive quiescent galaxies with the spectroscopic redshift $z=2.77$ in the COSMOS field, QO-1000. We first photometrically identify this structure as a $4.</description>

      <description>First author: Johannes U. Lange
We present a novel simulation-based cosmological analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy redshift-space clustering. Compared to analysis methods based on perturbation theory, our simulation-based approach allows us to probe a much wider range of scales, $0.4 , h^{-1} , \mathrm{Mpc}$ to $63 , h^{-1} , \mathrm{Mpc}$, including highly non-linear scales, and marginalises over astrophysical effects such as assembly bias. We apply this framework to data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey LOWZ sample cross-correlated with state-of-the-art gravitational lensing catalogues from the Kilo Degree Survey and the Dark Energy Survey.</description>

We have studied the system of globular clusters (GCs) that formed in other galaxies and eventually accreted onto the Milky Way. Thus, the samples of GCs belonging to different tidal streams, obtained on the basis of the latest data from the Gaia observatory, were taken from the literature. We measured the anisotropy of the distribution of these GCs using the gyration tensor and found that the distribution of GCs in the streams is isotropic.</description>

      <description>Sven Martens
The formation process of multiple populations in globular clusters is still up for debate. Kinematic differences between the populations are particularly interesting in this respect, because they allow us to distinguish between single-epoch formation scenarios and multi-epoch formation scenarios. We analyze the kinematics of 25 globular clusters and aim to find kinematic differences between multiple populations to constrain their formation process. We split red-giant branch (RGB) stars in each cluster into three populations (P1, P2, P3) for the type-II clusters and two populations (P1 and P2) otherwise using Hubble photometry.</description>

By using direct N-body numerical simulations, we model the dynamical co-evolution of two supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the surrounding stars in merging galaxies. In order to investigate how different stellar components evolve during the merger, we generate evolved stellar distributions with an initial mass function. Special schemes have also been developed to deal with some rare but interesting events, such as tidal disruption of main sequence stars, the plunge of low mass stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars and stellar mass black holes, and the partial tidal disruption of red giants or asymptotic giant branch stars.</description>

We use the measured scattering timescales of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) from the CHIME catalog to derive an upper limit on the magnetic field on sub-kpc scales in the intergalactic medium (IGM). A nonmagnetized, photoionized IGM is insufficient to explain the turbulent scattering at all redshifts, with a Warm-Hot component being marginally consistent with the data at $z \sim 1$. Accounting for the lower envelope of the temporal smearing distribution with a nonzero magnetic field leads to upper limits $B &amp;lt; 10$ nG on scales of 0.</description>

Based on a comparison of the SRG/eROSITA catalog of X-ray active stars and the Gaia catalog, a sample of 502 peculiar objects was obtained for which Gaia, on one hand, detects statistically significant values of parallax or proper motion and, on the other hand, registers signs of the non zero source extent in the optical band. In the log ($F_X/F_{\rm opt}$) - (G-RP) color diagram these objects are separated from the balk of X-ray active stars and are located in the region typical for the galaxies with active nuclei.</description>

The existence of globular clusters (GCs) in a few satellite galaxies, and their absence in majority of dwarf galaxies, present a challenge for models attempting to understand the origins of GCs. In addition to GC presence appearing stochastic and difficult to describe with average trends, in the smallest satellite galaxies GCs contribute a substantial fraction of total stellar mass. We investigate the stochasticity and number of GCs in dwarf galaxies using an updated version of our model that links the formation of GCs to the growth of the host galaxy mass.</description>

      <description>Andrea Incatasciato
The Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation field is a key ingredient in the chemo-thermal evolution of gas in the Early Universe, as it dissociates H2 molecules, the primary cooling channel in an environment devoid of metals and dust. Despite its important role, it is still not implemented in cosmological simulations on a regular basis, in contrast to the general UV background. This is in part due to uncertainty in the source modelling, their spectra and abundance, as well as the detailed physics involved in the propagation of the photons and their interactions with the molecules.</description>

The problem of the spatial motion of a passively gravitating body (PGB) in the gravitational field of a layered inhomogeneous elliptical galaxy (LIEG) is considered on the basis of the previously developed model. It is assumed that a LIEG consists of baryonic mass (BM) and dark matter (DM), which have different laws of density distribution. A star or the center of mass of a globular cluster is taken as the PGB, the motion of which considers the BM and DM attraction.</description>

The spectropolarimetry at +3 d shows increasing polarisation degree P towards the redder wavelengths and exhibits signs of axial symmetry, but at +29 d P=0 throughout the spectrum implying that the photosphere of SN 2017gci evolved from a slightly aspherical configuration to a more spherical one in the first month post-peak.</description>

This cylindrical kilotonne-scale water Cherenkov detector design has been developed to detect reactor antineutrinos through inverse $\beta$-decay for non-proliferation applications but also has the ability to observe antineutrino bursts of core-collapse supernovae within our galaxy. Detector configurations with sizes ranging from 16 m to 22 m tank diameter and 10% to 20% PMT coverage are used to compare the expected observable antineutrino spectra based on the Nakazato, Vartanyan and Warren supernova models.</description>

Based on these models, the total gravitational (potential) energy and rotational kinetic energy of an EG, as well as the velocity dispersion at a distance of its effective radius, are determined.</description>

We search for ultra-light axions as dark matter (DM) and dark energy particle candidates, for axion masses $10^{-32},\mathrm{eV} \leq m_\mathrm{a} \leq 10^{-24},\mathrm{eV}$, by a joint analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy clustering data &amp;ndash; and consider if axions can resolve the tension in inferred values of the matter clustering parameter $S_8$. We give legacy constraints from Planck 2018 CMB data, improving 2015 limits on the axion density $\Omega_\mathrm{a} h^2$ by up to a factor of three; CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope marginally weaken Planck bounds at $m_\mathrm{a} = 10^{-25},\mathrm{eV}$, owing to lower (and theoretically-consistent) gravitational lensing signals.</description>

      <description>First author: Marco Gullieuszik
Star-forming, H$\alpha$-emitting clumps are found embedded in the gaseous tails of galaxies undergoing intense ram-pressure stripping in galaxy clusters, so-called jellyfish galaxies. These clumps offer a unique opportunity to study star formation under extreme conditions, in the absence of an underlying disk and embedded within the hot intracluster medium. Yet, a comprehensive, high spatial resolution study of these systems is missing. We obtained UVIS/HST data to observe the first statistical sample of clumps in the tails and disks of six jellyfish galaxies from the GASP survey; we used a combination of broad-band filters and a narrow-band H{\alpha} filter.</description>

The powerful high-redshift quasar J2102+6015 (at z=4.575) may provide useful information for studying supermassive black hole growth, galaxy evolution and feedback in the early Universe. The source has so far been imaged with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) at 2/8 GHz (S/X) bands only, showing complex compact structure. Its total radio spectrum peaks at ~6 GHz in the rest frame. There is no sign of Doppler-boosted jet emission, and the separation of the two major features in its east-west oriented structure spanning ~10 milliarcsec does not change significantly on a timescale longer than a decade.</description>

      <description>First author: Ahmad Mehrabi
A model-independent or non-parametric approach for modeling a database has been widely used in cosmology. In these scenarios, the data has been used directly to reconstruct an underlying function. In this work, we introduce a novel semi-model-independent method to do the task. The new approach not only removes some drawbacks of previous methods but also has some remarkable advantages. We combine the well-known Gaussian linear model with a neural network and introduce a procedure for the reconstruction of an arbitrary function.</description>

The information on Galactic assembly time is imprinted on the chemodynamics of globular clusters. This makes them important probes that help us to understand the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Discerning between in-situ and ex-situ origin of these objects is difficult when we study the Galactic bulge, which is the most complex and mixed component of the Milky Way. To investigate the early evolution of the Galactic bulge, we analysed the globular cluster NGC 6355.</description>

      <description>First author: T. Tuominen
The current observational status of the hot (log T(K) &amp;gt; 5.5) warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) remains incomplete. While recent observations from stacking large numbers of Cosmic Web filaments have yielded statistically significant detections, direct measurements of single objects remain scarce. The lack of such a sample currently prevents a robust analysis of the cosmic baryon content composed of the hot WHIM, which could help solve the cosmological missing baryons problem.</description>

      <description>First author: M. Arabsalmani
We study the relation between the metallicities of ionised and neutral gas in star-forming galaxies at z=1-3 using the EAGLE cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. This is done by constructing a dense grid of sightlines through the simulated galaxies and obtaining the star formation rate- and HI column density-weighted metallicities, Z_{SFR} and Z_{HI}, for each sightline as proxies for the metallicities of ionised and neutral gas, respectively. We find Z_{SFR} &amp;gt; Z_{HI} for almost all sightlines, with their difference generally increasing with decreasing metallicity.</description>

      <description>First author: Alejandro Aviles
The next generation of galaxy surveys will provide highly accurate measurements of the large-scale structure of the Universe, allowing for more stringent tests of gravity on cosmological scales. Higher order statistics are a valuable tool to study the non-Gaussianities in the matter field and to break degeneracies between modified gravity and other physical or nuisance parameters. However, understanding from first principles the behaviour of these correlations is essential to characterise deviations from General Relativity (GR), and the purpose of this work.</description>

We present oxygen abundances relative to hydrogen (O/H) in the narrow line regions (NLRs) gas phases of Seyferts 1 (Sy 1s) and Seyferts 2 (Sy 2s) Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). We used fluxes of the optical narrow emission line intensities $3,500&amp;lt;\lambda($\AA$)&amp;lt;7,000$ of 561 Seyfert nuclei in the local universe ($z\lesssim0.31$) from the second catalog and data release (DR2) of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey, which focuses on the \textit{Swift}-BAT hard X-ray ($\gtrsim10$ keV) detected AGNs.</description>

      <description>First author: Seiji Kameno
The radio galaxy NGC 1052 casts absorption features of sulfur-bearing molecules, H$_2$S, SO, SO$_2$, and CS toward the radio continuum emission from the core and jets. Using ALMA, we have measured the equivalent widths of SO absorption features in multiple transitions and determined the temperatures of $344 \pm 43$ K and $26 \pm 4$ K in sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths, respectively. Since sub-mm and mm continuum represents the core and jets, the high and low temperatures of the absorbers imply warm environment in the molecular torus and cooler downstream flows.</description>

Long-term observations of synchrotron emission from supernovae (SNe), covering more than a year after the explosion, provide a unique opportunity to study the poorly-understood evolution of massive stars in the final millennium of their lives via changes in the mass-loss rate. Here, we present a result of our long-term monitoring of a peculiar type IIL SN 2018ivc, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Following the initial decay, it showed unprecedented rebrightening starting at ~ a year after the explosion.</description>

Strong gravitational lensing and microlensing of supernovae (SNe) are emerging as a new probe of cosmology and astrophysics in recent years. We provide an overview of this nascent research field, starting with a summary of the first discoveries of strongly lensed SNe. We describe the use of the time delays between multiple SN images as a way to measure cosmological distances and thus constrain cosmological parameters, particularly the Hubble constant, whose value is currently under heated debates.</description>

We have performed targeted searches of known, extragalactic transient events at millimetre wavelengths using nine seasons (2013&amp;ndash;2021) of 98, 150, and 229 GHz Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) observations that mapped ${\sim}40$ per cent of the sky for most of the data volume. We observe at least once 88 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), 12 tidal disruption events (TDEs) and 203 other transients, including supernovae (SNe). We stack our ACT observations to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the maps.</description>

Milky Way-mass galaxies in the FIRE-2 simulations demonstrate two main modes of star formation. At high redshifts star formation occurs in a series of short and intense bursts, while at low redshifts star formation proceeds at a steady rate with a transition from one mode to another at times ranging from 3 to 7 Gyr ago for different galaxies. We analyse how the mode of star formation affects iron and alpha-element abundance.</description>

      <description>John Pharo,
We present measurements of $[NeIII]$ Œª3869 emission in z~1 low-mass galaxies taken from the Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic surveys HALO7D and DEEPWinds. We identify 167 individual galaxies with significant $[NeIII]$ emission lines, including 112 &amp;amp;#34;dwarf&amp;amp;#34; galaxies with log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &amp;amp;lt; 9.5, with 0.3 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 1.4. We also measure $[NeIII]$ emission from composite spectra derived from all $[OII]$ŒªŒª3727,3729 line emitters in this range. This provides a unique sample of $[NeIII]$-emitters in the gap between well-studied emitters at z = 0 and 2 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 3.</description>

We assemble a sample of 696 type 1 AGN up to a redshift of $z=2.5$, all of which have an SDSS spectrum containing at least one broad emission line (H $\alpha$, H $\beta$ or Mg II) and an XMM-Newton X-ray spectrum containing at least 250 counts in addition to simultaneous optical/ultraviolet photometry from the XMM Optical Monitor. Our sample includes quasars and narrow-line Seyfert 1s: thus our AGN span a wide range in luminosity, black hole mass and accretion rate.</description>

Spectroscopic studies of extreme-ionization galaxies (EIGs) are critical to our understanding of exotic systems throughout cosmic time. These EIGs exhibit spectral features requiring &amp;gt;54.42 eV photons: the energy needed to fully ionize helium into He2+ and emit He II recombination lines. They are likely key contributors to reionization, and they can also probe exotic stellar populations or accretion onto massive black holes. To facilitate the use of EIGs as probes of high ionization, we focus on ratios constructed from strong rest-frame UV/optical emission lines, specifically $[O III]$ 5008, H-beta, $[Ne III]$ 3870, $[O II]$ 3727,3729, and $[Ne V]$ 3427.</description>

We present a new methodology for simulating mid-infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in galaxy evolution simulations. To do this, we combine theoretical models of PAH emission features as they respond to varying interstellar radiation fields, grain size distributions, and ionization states with a new on-the-fly model for dust evolution in hydrodynamic galaxy simulations. We apply these models to 3 idealized arepo galaxy evolution simulations within the smuggle physics framework.</description>

These equations are able to account for the tilt of the Fundamental Plane (FP) and to explain the observed distributions of ETGs in all its projections.</description>

      <description>First author: Sandra I. Raimundo
External accretion events such as a galaxy merger or the accretion of gas from the immediate environment of a galaxy, can create a large misalignment between the gas and the stellar kinematics. Numerical simulations have suggested that misaligned structures may promote the inflow of gas to the nucleus of the galaxy and the accretion of gas by the central supermassive black hole. We show for the first time that galaxies with a strong misalignment between the ionised gas and stellar kinematic angles have a higher observed fraction of active black holes than galaxies with aligned rotation of gas and stars.</description>

Arkenstone is a new model for multiphase, stellar feedback driven galactic winds designed for inclusion in coarse resolution cosmological simulations. In this first paper of a series, we describe the features that allow Arkenstone to properly treat high specific energy wind components and demonstrate them using idealised non-cosmological simulations of a galaxy with a realistic CGM, using the Arepo code. Hot, fast gas phases with low mass loadings are predicted to dominate the energy content of multiphase outflows.</description>

The ultra-luminous infrared galaxy Arp2 20 is a late-stage merger with several tidal structures in the outskirts and two very compact, dusty nuclei that show evidence for extreme star formation and host at least one AGN. New and archival high-resolution images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope provide a state-of-the-art view of the structures, dust, and stellar clusters in Arp 220. We find that ~90% of the Halpha emission arises from a shock-ionized bubble emanating from the AGN in the western nucleus, while the nuclear disks dominate the Pbeta emission.</description>

The flattened, possibly co-rotating plane of satellite galaxies around Centaurus A, if more than a fortuitous alignment, adds to the pre-existing tension between the well-studied Milky Way and M31 planes and the $Œõ$CDM model of structure formation. It was recently reported that the Centaurus A satellite plane (CASP) may be rotationally supported, but a further understanding of the system&amp;amp;#39;s kinematics is elusive in the absence of full three-dimensional velocities.</description>

      <description>First author: Kosuke Jamie Kanehisa
The flattened, possibly co-rotating plane of satellite galaxies around Centaurus A, if more than a fortuitous alignment, adds to the pre-existing tension between the well-studied Milky Way and M31 planes and the $\Lambda$CDM model of structure formation. It was recently reported that the Centaurus A satellite plane (CASP) may be rotationally supported, but a further understanding of the system&amp;rsquo;s kinematics is elusive in the absence of full three-dimensional velocities.</description>

      <description>First author: Seokcheon Lee
At least one dimensionless physical constant (i.e., a physically observable) must change for the cosmic time to make the varying speed of light (VSL) models phenomenologically feasible. Various physical constants and quantities also should be functions of cosmic time to satisfy all known local laws of physics, including special relativity, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. Adiabaticity is another necessary condition to keep the homogeneity and isotropy of three-dimensional space [1].</description>

      <title>Detailed chemical abundances of stars in the outskirts of the Tucana II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy</title>

      <description>Anirudh Chiti
We present chemical abundances and velocities of five stars between 0.3 kpc to 1.1 kpc from the center of the Tucana II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) from high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy. We find that every star is deficient in metals (-3.6 &amp;amp;lt; $[Fe/H]$ &amp;amp;lt; -1.9) and in neutron-capture elements as is characteristic of UFD stars, unambiguously confirming their association with Tucana II. Other chemical abundances (e.g., C, iron-peak) largely follow UFD trends and suggest that faint core-collapse supernovae (SNe) dominated the early evolution of Tucana II.</description>

We present a dynamical analysis of a quasar-host galaxy at $z\simeq 6$ (SDSS J2310+1855) using a high-resolution ALMA observation of the $[CII]$ emission line. The observed rotation curve was fitted with mass models that considered the gravitational contribution of a thick gas disc, a thick star-forming stellar disc, and a central mass concentration, which is likely due to a combination of a spheroidal component (i.e. a stellar bulge) and a supermassive black hole (SMBH).</description>

      <description>First author: Tucker Jones
The abundance of carbon relative to oxygen (C/O) is a promising probe of star formation history in the early universe, as these elements are produced on different timescales. We present a measurement of $\log{\mathrm{(C/O)}} = -1.01\pm0.12$ (stat) $\pm0.10$ (sys) in a $z=6.23$ galaxy observed as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program. Notably, we achieve good precision thanks to the detection of the rest-frame ultraviolet O III], C III], and C IV emission lines delivered by JWST/NIRSpec.</description>

We utilize medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations of 164 galaxies at $z=2.0-9.3$ from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey to investigate the evolution of the excitation and ionization properties of galaxies at high redshifts. Our results represent the first statistical constraints on the evolution of the $[OIII]$/H$\beta$ vs. $[NII]$/H$\alpha$, $[SII]$/H$\alpha$, and $[OI]$/H$\alpha$ ``BPT&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; diagrams at $z&amp;gt;2.7$, and the first analysis of the O32 vs. R23 diagram at $z&amp;gt;4$ with a large sample.</description>

      <description>Mohsen Khodadi
This paper is dedicated to assessing modified cosmological settings based on the gravitational Standard-Model Extension (SME). Our analysis rests upon the Hubble tension (HT), which is a discrepancy between the observational determination of the Hubble parameter via data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae, respectively. While the latter approach is model-independent, the former highly depends on the model used to describe the physics of the early Universe.</description>

We present the analysis of multiepoch observations of a set of 12 variable, Compton-thin, local (z&amp;lt;0.1) active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected from the 100-month BAT catalog. We analyze all available X-ray data from \chandra, \xmm, and \nustar, adding up to a total of 53 individual observations. This corresponds to between 3 and 7 observations per source, probing variability timescales between a few days and $\sim 20$~yr.</description>

Gravitational waves (GWs) from the compact binary coalescences can be used as standard sirens to explore the cosmic expansion history. In the next decades, it is anticipated that we could obtain the multi-band GW standard siren data (from nanohertz to a few hundred hertz), which are expected to play an important role in cosmological parameter estimation. In this work, we give for the first time the joint constraints on cosmological parameters using the future multi-band GW standard siren observations.</description>

      <description>First author: Mengtao Tang
We describe new JWST/NIRSpec observations of galaxies at $z\gtrsim7$ taken as part of the CEERS survey of the EGS field. Previous observations of this area have revealed associations of Ly$\alpha$ emitters at redshifts ($z=7.5$, $7.7$, $8.7$) where the IGM is thought mostly neutral, leading to suggestions that these systems are situated in large ionized bubbles. We identify 21 $z\gtrsim7$ galaxies with robust redshifts in the CEERS dataset, including 10 in the Ly$\alpha$ associations.</description>

Using the data from Gaia (ESA) Data Release 2 we performed the orbital calculations of globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way. To explore possible close encounters (or collisions) between the GCs, using our own developed high-order phi-GRAPE code, we integrated backward and forward the orbits of 119 objects with reliable positions and proper motions. In calculations, we adopted a realistic axisymmetric Galactic potential (bulge + disk + halo).</description>

Different from previously reported results, which show a seemingly extended source, we instead find two individual point sources, one consistent with being at the center and one 0\fdg4 south-east of the center.</description>

One of the primary goals when studying galaxy formation is to understand how the luminous component of the Universe, galaxies, relates to the growth of structure which is dominated by the gravitational collapse of dark matter haloes. The stellar-to-halo mass relation probes how galaxies occupy dark matter haloes and what that entails for their star formation history. We deliver the first self-consistent empirical model that can place constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation down to log stellar mass $\log_{10}(m^/\mathrm{M}{\odot}) \leq 5.</description>

The standard model of cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) is facing a serious crisis caused by the inconsistencies in the measurements of some fundamental cosmological parameters (Hubble constant $H_{0}$ and cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_{k}$ for example). On the other hand a strictly linear evolution of the cosmological scale factor is found to be an excellent fit to a host of observations. Any model that can support such a coasting presents itself as a falsifiable model as far as the cosmological tests are concerned.</description>

      <description>First author: Benjamin Metha
Massive stars are thought to be progenitors of Long Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), most likely with a bias favouring low metallicity progenitors. Because galaxies do not have a constant metallicity throughout, the combination of line-of-sight absorption metallicity inferred from GRB afterglow spectroscopy and of host galaxy global metallicity derived from emission lines diagnostics represents a powerful way to probe both the bias function for GRB progenitors, and the chemical inhomogeneities across star forming regions.</description>

Photometric quality metrics from DOLPHOT in one or two filters can recover a pure sample of stars. Conversely, colors formed between short-wavelength (SW) and long-wavelength (LW) filters can be used to effectively identify pure samples of galaxies.</description>

Extreme stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe), including Type Ic superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), broad-line Type Ic SNe (SNe Ic-BL), and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), are widely believed to harbor a newborn fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron star (``magnetar&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;), which can lose its rotational energy via spin-down processes to accelerate and heat the ejecta. The progenitor(s) of these magnetar-driven SESNe, and the origin of considerable angular momentum (AM) in the cores of massive stars to finally produce such fast-spinning magnetars upon core-collapse are still under debate.</description>

Stellar bars have been found to substantially influence the stellar populations properties in galaxies, affecting their ability of forming stars. While this can be easily seen when studying galaxies in relatively isolated environments, such kind of analysis takes a higher degree of complexity when cluster galaxies are considered, due to the variety of interactions which can potentially occur in these denser environments. We use IFU MUSE data from the GASP survey to study the combined effect of the presence of a stellar bar and of ram pressure, on spatially resolved properties of stellar populations.</description>

      <description>First author: Pia Jakobus
Using relativistic supernova simulations of massive progenitor stars with a quark-hadron equation of state (EoS) and a purely hadronic EoS, we identify a distinctive feature in the gravitational-wave signal that originates from a buoyancy-driven mode (g-mode) below the proto-neutron star convection zone. The mode frequency lies in the range $200\lesssim f\lesssim 800,\text{Hz}$ and decreases with time. As the mode lives in the core of the proto-neutron star, its frequency and power are highly sensitive to the EoS, in particular the sound speed around twice saturation density.</description>

The relationship between galaxies and haloes is central to the description of galaxy formation, and a fundamental step towards extracting precise cosmological information from galaxy maps. However, this connection involves several complex processes that are interconnected. Machine Learning methods are flexible tools that can learn complex correlations between a large number of features, but are traditionally designed as deterministic estimators. In this work, we use the IllustrisTNG300-1 simulation and apply neural networks in a binning classification scheme to predict probability distributions of central galaxy properties, namely stellar mass, colour, specific star formation rate, and radius, using as input features the halo mass, concentration, spin, age, and the overdensity on a scale of 3 $h^{-1}$ Mpc.</description>

Mrk 1239 is a highly polarized NLS1 in the optical band, whose $0.3-3$ keV spectrum has remained remarkably consistent over more than two decades of observation. Previous analysis of this object suggested that the soft X-ray band was dominated by emission lines (collisionally and/or photoionized) from the distant host galaxy as the X-ray emission from the central engine was highly obscured. New XMM-Newton data of Mrk 1239 are presented here to investigate the soft X-ray band of this galaxy with high resolution.</description>
