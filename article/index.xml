      <description>First author: Yi-Xian Chen
We perform 3D radiation hydrodynamic local shearing box simulations to study the outcome of gravitational instability (GI) in optically thick Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. GI develops when the Toomre parameter QT \leq 1, and may lead to turbulent heating that balances radiative cooling. However, when radiative cooling is too efficient, the disk may undergo runaway gravitational fragmentation. In the fully gas-pressure-dominated case, we confirm the classical result that such a thermal balance holds when the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter (alpha) due to the gravitationally-driven turbulence is \sim 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Eric Giunchi
Exploiting broad- and narrow-band images of the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} from near-UV to I-band restframe, we study the star-forming clumps of six galaxies of the GASP sample undergoing strong ram-pressure stripping (RPS). Clumps are detected in H$\alpha$ and near-UV, tracing star formation on different timescales. We consider clumps located in galaxy disks, in the stripped tails and those formed in stripped gas but still close to the disk, called extraplanar.</description>

      <description>First author: Iurii Sushch
The spectral shape of the gamma-ray emission observed for dynamically old supernova remnants that interact with molecular clouds triggered an exciting scenario of adiabatic compression and farther re-acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) in radiative shells of the remnants, which was extensively discussed and applied to various sources over recent years. Indeed, the observed gamma-ray spectrum from a number of remnants strongly resembles the expected spectrum of the gamma-ray emission from the compressed population of Galactic cosmic rays.</description>

      <description>First author: Alyssa D. Sokol
UV-FIR SED modeling is an effective way to disentangle emission between star formation (SF) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxies; however, this approach becomes uncertain for composite AGN/SF galaxies that comprise 50-70% of IR-samples. Cosmic X-ray background (XRB) models require a large fraction of obscured AGN to reproduce the observed XRB peak, motivating reliable SED analyses in objects where the AGN may be ``buried&amp;quot; in the galaxy and in the mid-IR to far-IR SED.</description>

      <description>First author: Gopal-Krishna
A small subset of extragalactic double radio sources, termed HYMORS (HYbrid MOrpholgy Radio Sources), is distinguished by a very unusual, hybrid morphology in terms of the Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classification. In HYMORS, one radio lobe appears edge-darkened (FR I), while the other shows a well-defined emission peak near its outer edge (edge-brightened, FR II). Such sources are rare but critical for constraining the mechanism responsible for the FR dichotomy, a widely debated issue in extragalactic astrophysics.</description>

      <description>First author: Seokcheon Lee
The Friedmann-Lema^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker model establishes the correlation between redshifts and distances. It has a metric expansion of space. As a result, the wavelength of photons propagating through the expanding space is stretched, creating the cosmological redshift, $z$. It also relates the frequency of light detected by a local observer to that emitted from a distant source. In standard cosmology (\textit{i.e.} a constant speed light model, $c =$ constant), this relation is given by a factor $1/(1+z)$$[1]$.</description>

      <description>First author: Hicran Bakis
We present the first results from an imaging and a spectroscopic survey of the optical emission associated with supernova remnant (SNR) G107.5$-$1.5. We discovered optical diffuse and filamentary emission from G107.5$-$1.5 using the 1.5-m and 1-m telescopes. The optical emission from the North East (NE) and North West (NW) regions show the diffuse structure, while the South East (SE) and East (E) regions show filamentary structure.</description>

      <description>First author: Ian Blackstone
Radiation pressure on dust is an important feedback process around star clusters and may eject gas from bright sub-regions in star-forming galaxies. The Eddington ratio has previously been constructed for galaxy-averaged observations, individual star clusters, and Galactic HII regions. Here we assess the role of radiation pressure in thousands of sub-regions across two local star-forming galaxies, NGC 6946 and NGC 5194. Using a model for the spectral energy distribution from stellar population synthesis and realistic dust grain scattering and absorption, we compute flux- and radiation pressure-mean opacities and population-averaged optical depth $\langle\tau_{\rm RP}\rangle$.</description>

We explore the properties of galaxies in the proximity (within a $\sim$2 Mpc radius sphere) of Type I quasars at 0.1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.35, to check whether and how an active galaxy influences the properties of its neighbors. We further compare these with the properties of neighbors around inactive galaxies of the same mass and redshift within the same volume of space, using the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic survey.</description>

      <description>First author: Dieu D. Nguyen
As the earliest relics of star formation episodes in the history of the Universe, the most massive galaxies are the key to our understanding of the evolution of the stellar population, cosmic structure, and SMBHs. However, the details of their formation histories remain uncertain. We address these problems by planning a large survey sample of ultramassive galaxies ($z\le0.3$, $|\delta+24^{\circ}|&amp;lt;45$\deg, $|b|&amp;gt;8$\deg), including 76% E, 17% S0, and 7% S brighter than $M_K\le-27$ mag (stellar mass $2\times10^{12}&amp;lt;M_\star&amp;lt;5\times10^{12}$ M$\odot$) with the HARMONI instrument on ELT.</description>

      <description>First author: Takami Kuroda
We perform multi-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations in a massive scalar-tensor theory for the first time with a realistic equation of state and multi-energy neutrino radiation. Among the set of our models varying the scalar mass and the coupling strength between the scalar and gravitational fields, a particular model allows for recurrent spontaneous scalarizations (SSs) in the proto-neutron star (PNS). Each SS induces the PNS collapse and subsequent bounce, from which devastating shock waves emanate and eject the PNS envelope.</description>

      <description>First author: R. Calvi
There is controversy whether dusty starbursts selected at submillimeter wavelengths can trace galaxy overdensities. We perform the first systematic search for protoclusters around a homogeneously selected sample of 12 spectroscopically confirmed submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $z\sim1.2-5.3$ in the GOODS-N field. We applied the Poisson Probability Method (PPM) to search for Mpc scale overdensities around these SMGs using three photometric redshift catalogs. We detect galaxy overdensities for 11 out of the 12 SMGs ($92%\pm8$%), distributed over eight protoclusters.</description>

      <description>First author: Fulvio Melia
The so-called impossibly early galaxy&#39; problem, first identified via the Hubble Space Telescope&#39;s observation of galaxies at redshifts z &amp;gt; 10, appears to have been exacerbated by the more recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovery of galaxy candidates at even higher redshifts (z ~ 17) which, however, are yet to be confirmed spectroscopically. These candidates would have emerged only ~ 230 million years after the big bang in the context of LCDM, requiring a more rapid star formation in the earliest galaxies than appears to be permitted by simulations adopting the concordance model parameters.</description>

      <description>First author: Naveen A. Reddy
We use the large spectroscopic dataset of the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey to investigate some of the key factors responsible for the elevated ionization parameters (U) inferred for high-redshift galaxies, focusing in particular on the role of star-formation-rate surface density (Sigma_SFR). Using a sample of 317 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts z~1.9-3.7, we construct composite rest-frame optical spectra in bins of Sigma_SFR and infer electron densities, n_e, using the ratio of the $[OII]$ 3727, 3730 doublet.</description>

      <description>First author: Jakob M. Helton
We report the discovery of an extreme galaxy overdensity at $z = 5.4$ in the GOODS-S field using JWST/NIRCam imaging from JADES and JEMS alongside JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO. We identified potential members of the overdensity using HST+JWST photometry spanning $\lambda = 0.4-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}$. These data provide accurate and well-constrained photometric redshifts down to $m \approx 29-30,\mathrm{mag}$. We subsequently confirmed $N = 96$ potential members of the overdensity using JWST slitless spectroscopy over $\lambda = 3.</description>

Recent data from the James Webb Space Telescope suggest that there are realistic prospects for detecting the earliest generation of stars at redshift ~20. These metal-poor, gaseous Population III stars are likely in the mass range $10-10^3 M_\odot$. We develop a framework for calculating the abundances of Pop III stars as well as the distribution of the most massive Pop III stars based on an application of extreme-value statistics.</description>

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are successful cosmological distance indicators and important element factories in the chemical evolution of galaxies. They are generally thought to originate from thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in close binaries. However, the observed diversity among SNe Ia implies that they have different progenitor models. In this article, we performed the long-term evolution of NS+He star binaries with different initial He star masses ($M_{\rm He}^{\rm i}$) and orbital periods ($P_{\rm orb}^{\rm i}$) for the first time, in which the He star companions can explode as SNe Ia eventually.</description>

The chemical inventory of hot Jupiter (HJ) exoplanets atmospheres continue to be observed by various ground and space based instruments in increasing detail and precision. It is expected that some HJs will exhibit strong non-equilibrium chemistry characteristics in their atmospheres, which might be inferred from spectral observations. We aim to model the three dimensional thermochemical non-equilibrium chemistry in the atmospheres of the HJs WASP-39b and HD 189733b.</description>

The Milky Way accreted several smaller satellite galaxies in its history. These mergers added stars and gas to the Galaxy and affected the properties of the pre-existing stellar populations. Stellar chemical abundances and ages are needed to establish the chronological order of events that occur before, during, and after such mergers. We report precise ages ($\sim$6.5%) and chemical abundances for the Titans, a sample of old metal-poor dwarfs and subgiants with accurate atmospheric parameters.</description>

Line locking (LL) of absorption line systems is a clear signature of the dynamical importance of radiation pressure force in driving astrophysical flows, with recent findings suggesting that it may be common in quasars exhibiting multiple intrinsic narrow absorption-line (NAL) systems. In this work we probe the phase space conducive to LL and follow the detailed kinematics of those systems that may lock at the velocity separation of the CIV $\lambda\lambda 1548.</description>

We present the measurements of the small-scale clustering for the emission line galaxy (ELG) sample from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). We use conditional abundance matching method to interpret the clustering measurements from $0.34h^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}$ to $70h^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}$. In order to account for the correlation between properties of emission line galaxies and their environment, we add a secondary connection between star formation rate of ELGs and halo accretion rate.</description>

      <description>First author: Shreya Anand
One of the open questions following the discovery of GW170817 is whether neutron star mergers are the only astrophysical sites capable of producing r-process elements. Simulations have shown that 0.01-0.1M$_\odot$ of r-process material could be generated in the outflows originating from the accretion disk surrounding the rapidly rotating black hole that forms as a remnant to both neutron star mergers and collapsing massive stars associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (collapsars).</description>

      <description>Shihong Liao
We introduce a new model for the accretion and feedback of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries to the KETJU code, which enables us to resolve the evolution of SMBH binaries down to separations of tens of Schwarzschild radii in gas-rich galaxy mergers. Our subgrid binary accretion model extends the widely used Bondi--Hoyle--Lyttleton accretion into the binary phase and incorporates preferential mass accretion onto the secondary SMBH, which is motivated by results from small-scale hydrodynamical circumbinary disc simulations.</description>

We have performed a systematic study of the rotational, orbital and X-ray properties of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) and compared their nature with those of the MSPs in the Galactic field (GF). We found that GC MSPs generally rotate slower than their counterparts in the GF. Different from the expectation of a simple recycling scenario, no evidence for the correlation between the orbital period and the rotation period can be found from the MSP binaries in GCs.</description>

We present CEERS JWST/NIRCam imaging of a massive galaxy group at z=1.85, to explore the early JWST view on massive group formation in the distant Universe. The group contains &amp;gt;16 members (including 6 spectros. confirmations) down to log10(Mstar/Msun)=8.5, including the Brightest Group Galaxy (BGG) in the process of actively assembling at this redshift. The BGG is comprised of multiple merging components extending ~3.6&amp;quot; (30kpc) across the sky.</description>

Thermal energies deposited by OB stellar clusters in starburst galaxies lead to the formation of galactic superwinds. Multi-wavelength observations of starburst-driven superwinds pointed at complex thermal and ionization structures which cannot adequately be explained by simple adiabatic assumptions. In this study, we perform hydrodynamic simulations of a fluid model coupled to radiative cooling functions, and generate time-dependent non-equilibrium photoionization models to predict physical conditions and ionization structures of superwinds using the MAIHEM atomic and cooling package built on the program FLASH.</description>

      <description>First author: James M. Sullivan
Neutrino mass constraints are a primary focus of current and future large-scale structure (LSS) surveys. Non-linear LSS models rely heavily on cosmological simulations &amp;ndash; the impact of massive neutrinos should therefore be included in these simulations in a realistic, computationally tractable, and controlled manner. A recent proposal to reduce the related computational cost employs a symmetric neutrino momentum sampling strategy in the initial conditions. We implement a modified version of this strategy into the Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC) and perform convergence tests on its internal parameters.</description>

As groups of coeval stars born from the same molecular cloud, an Open cluster (OC) is an ideal laboratory for studying the structure and dynamical evolution of the Milky Way. The release of High-Precision Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) and modern machine-learning methods offer unprecedented opportunities to identify OCs. In this study, we extended conventional HDBSCAN (e-HDBSCAN) for searching for new OCs in Gaia EDR3. A pipeline was developed based on the parallel computing technique to blindly search for open clusters from Gaia EDR3 within Galactic latitudes $\left| b \right|$ $&amp;amp;lt;$25 $^\circ$.</description>

Dark matter is a key piece of the current cosmological scenario, with weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) a leading dark matter candidate. WIMPs have not been detected in their conventional parameter space (100 GeV $\lesssim M_χ \lesssim$ 100 TeV), a mass range accessible with current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. As ultraheavy dark matter (UHDM; $M_χ \gtrsim$ 100 TeV) has been suggested as an under-explored alternative to the WIMP paradigm, we search for an indirect dark matter annihilation signal in a higher mass range (up to 30 PeV) with the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory.</description>

We present a photometric study of the resolved stellar populations in And IX, the closest satellite to the M31, a metal-poor and low-mass dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We estimate a distance modulus of $24.56_{-0.15}^{+0.05}$ mag based on the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB). By probing the variability of asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB), we study the star formation history of And IX. We identified 50 long period variables (LPVs) in And IX using the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) in two filters, Sloan $i&amp;amp;#39;$ and Harris $V$.</description>

Theoretical studies predict that the most significant growth of supermassive black holes occurs in late-stage mergers, coinciding with the manifestation of dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and both major and minor mergers are expected to be important for dual AGN growth. In fact, dual AGNs in minor mergers should be signposts for efficient minor merger-induced SMBH growth for both the more and less massive progenitor.</description>

Based on the local geometric index of the galaxies, we identify their local environments to be voids, sheets, filaments or clusters.</description>

When the first galaxies formed and starlight escaped into the intergalactic medium to reionize it, galaxy formation and reionization were both highly inhomogeneous in time and space, and fully-coupled by mutual feedback. To show how this imprinted the UV luminosity function (UVLF) of reionization-era galaxies, we use our large-scale, radiation-hydrodynamics simulation CoDa II to derive the time- and space-varying halo mass function and UVLF, from $z\simeq6$-15.</description>

Direct observational evidence for the creation of nuclear star clusters (NSCs) is needed to support the proposed scenarios for their formation. We have analyzed the dwarf galaxy UGC 7346, located in the peripheral regions of the Virgo Cluster, to highlight a series of properties that indicate the formation of a NSC caught in its earlier stages. First, we report remnants of a past interaction in the form of diffuse streams or shells, suggesting a recent merge of two dwarf galaxies with a 1:5 stellar mass ratio.</description>

In this work, we explore the connection between the gravitational wave (GW) merger rates of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBH) and galaxy properties. We do this by generating populations of stars using the binary synthesis code COMPAS and evolving them in galaxies from the semi-analytic galaxy formation model {\sc Shark}, to determine the number of mergers occurring in each simulation time-step. We find that large, metal-rich galaxies with high star formation rates are more likely to have gravitational wave (GW) events compared to younger, more metal poor galaxies.</description>

KOSMOS is a low-resolution, long-slit, optical spectrograph that has been upgraded at the University of Washington for its move from Kitt Peak National Observatory&amp;rsquo;s Mayall 4m telescope to the Apache Point Observatory&amp;rsquo;s ARC 3.5m telescope. One of the additions to KOSMOS is a slitviewer, which requires the fabrication of reflective slits, as KOSMOS previously used matte slits machined via wire EDM. We explore a novel method of slit fabrication using nanofabrication methods and compare the slit edge roughness, width uniformity, and the resulting scattering of the new fabricated slits to the original slits.</description>

Recently, several studies reported a significant discrepancy between the clustering and lensing of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) galaxies in the $\textit{Planck}$ cosmology. We construct a simple yet powerful model based on the linear theory to assess whether this discrepancy points toward deviations from $\textit{Planck}$. Focusing on scales $10&amp;lt;R&amp;lt;30$ $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$, we model the amplitudes of clustering and lensing of BOSS LOWZ galaxies using three parameters: galaxy bias $b_\mathrm{g}$, galaxy-matter cross-correlation coefficient $r_\mathrm{gm}$, and $A$, defined as the ratio between the true and $\textit{Planck}$ values of $\sigma_8$.</description>

Detection of hard X-ray spectrum from the kilo-parsec scale jet of active galactic nuclei cannot be accounted to the synchrotron emission mechanism from the electron distribution responsible for the radio/optical emission. Alternate explanations are the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons (IC/CMB) or synchrotron emission from a second electron population. When the X-ray emission is interpreted as IC/CMB process, the Compton spectrum peak at GeV energy and were predicted to be the Fermi candidate sources.</description>

The characteristic signatures of massive neutrinos on large-scale structure (LSS), if fully captured, can be used to put a stringent constraint on their mass sum, $M_{\nu}$. Previous work utilizing N-body simulations has shown the Minkowski functionals (MFs) of LSS can reveal the imprints of massive neutrinos on LSS, provide important complementary information to two-point statistics and significantly improve constraints on $M_{\nu}$. In this work, we take a step forward and apply the statistics to the biased tracers of LSS, i.</description>

      <description>First author: Rebecca Mayes
We use the hydrodynamic EAGLE simulation to predict the numbers and masses of supermassive black holes in stripped nuclei and compare these to confirmed measurements of black holes in observed UCDs. We find that black holes in stripped nuclei are consistent with the numbers and masses of those in observed UCDs. Approximately 50 per cent of stripped nuclei with $M &amp;gt; 2 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ should contain supermassive black holes.</description>

We study the ensemble X-ray variability properties of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) over a large range of timescales (20 ks $\leq T\leq$ 14 yrs), redshift ($0\leq z \lesssim 3$), luminosities ($10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}\leq L_X\leq 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and black hole (BH) masses ($10^6 \leq $M$_\odot \leq 10^9$). We propose the use of the variance-frequency diagram, as a viable alternative to the study of the power spectral density (PSD), which is not yet accessible for distant, faint and/or sparsely sampled AGN.</description>

      <description>Victoria I. De Cun
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) merging in dwarf galaxies will be detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) in the mid-2030s. Previous cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have shown the prediction of massive black holes merging in dwarf galaxies, but these simulations are limited by their resolution and cannot follow black hole pairs all the way to coalescence. We calculate the delay time between black hole pairing and merger based on the properties of the black holes and their host galaxies, and use these properties to calculate gravitational wave strains for eleven different binary black holes that merge inside dwarf galaxies from eight cosmological simulations.</description>

The abundance, temperature, and clustering of metals in the intergalactic medium are important parameters for understanding their cosmic evolution and quantifying their impact on cosmological analysis with the Ly $\alpha$ forest. The properties of these systems are typically measured from individual quasar spectra redward of the quasar&amp;rsquo;s Ly $\alpha$ emission line, yet that approach may provide biased results due to selection effects. We present an alternative approach to measure these properties in an unbiased manner with the two-point statistics commonly employed to quantify large-scale structure.</description>

Stars are fossils that retain the history of their host galaxies. Elements heavier than helium are created inside stars and are ejected when they die. From the spatial distribution of elements in galaxies, it is therefore possible to constrain the physical processes during galaxy formation and evolution. This approach, Galac- tic archaeology, has been popularly used for our Milky Way Galaxy with a vast amount of data from Gaia satellite and multi-object spectrographs to understand the origins of sub-structures of the Milky Way.</description>

      <description>Chen Zhang
It is intriguing to ask whether the existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe could significantly reduce the abundance of certain stable massive particles (SMP) via gravitational capture, after which the PBHs evaporate before BBN to avoid conflict with stringent bounds. For example, this mechanism is relevant to an alternative solution of the monopole problem proposed by Stojkovic and Freese, in which magnetic monopoles produced in the early universe are captured by PBHs, thus freeing inflation from having to occur during or after the corresponding phase transitions that produced the monopoles.</description>

The halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework is an empirical method to describe the connection between dark matter halos and galaxies, which is constrained by small scale clustering data. Efficient fitting procedures are required to scan the HOD parameter space. This paper describes such a method based on Gaussian Processes to iteratively build a surrogate model of the posterior of the likelihood surface from a reasonable amount of likelihood computations, typically two orders of magnitude less than standard Monte Carlo Markov chain algorithms.</description>

      <description>First author: Leonardo Giani
We investigate the cosmological implications of an effective gravitational action, inspired by Sakharov&amp;rsquo;s idea of induced gravity, containing non-local contributions from the operator $\left(\Box +\beta \right)^{-1} R$. The $\beta$ term is a novel feature in the panorama of non-local models of gravity, and arises naturally within Sakharov theory from the potential of a non-minimally coupled scalar field after a spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place. In this class of models the non-local contribution can acquire an oscillatory behaviour, thereby avoiding the divergence of the Hubble parameter at late times, which is another characteristic feature of the non-local models treated in the literature.</description>

We present JWST NIRCam 9-band near-infrared imaging of the luminous $z=10.6$ galaxy GN-z11 from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of the GOODS-N field. We find a spectral energy distribution (SED) entirely consistent with the expected form of a high-redshift galaxy: a clear blue continuum from 1.5 to 4 microns with a complete dropout in F115W. The core of GN-z11 is extremely compact in JWST imaging.</description>

We present JADES JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GN-z11, the most luminous candidate $z&amp;gt;10$ Lyman break galaxy in the GOODS-North field with $M_{UV}=-21.5$. We derive a redshift of $z=10.603$ (lower than previous determinations) based on multiple emission lines in our low and medium resolution spectra over $0.8-5.3,\mu$m. We significantly detect the continuum and measure a blue rest-UV spectral slope of $\beta=-2.4$. Remarkably, we see spatially-extended Lyman-$\alpha$ in emission (despite the highly-neutral IGM expected at this early epoch), offset 555 km/s redward of the systemic redshift.</description>

(Abridged) In this article, we discuss the state of AGN feedback&#39;&#39; in radio-quiet (RQ) AGN. This study involves heterogeneous samples of nearby Seyfert and LINER galaxies as well as QSOs that have been observed at low radio frequencies (few ~100 MHz) with the GMRT and ~GHz frequencies with the VLA and VLBA. These multi-frequency, multi-resolution observations detect a range of arcsecond-scale radio spectral indices that are consistent with the presence of multiple contributors including starburst winds and AGN jets or winds; steep spectrum relic&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; emission is observed as well.</description>

We report a new test of modified gravity theories using the large-scale structure of the Universe. This paper is the first attempt to (1) apply a joint analysis of the anisotropic components of galaxy two- and three-point correlation functions (2 and 3PCFs) to actual galaxy data and (2) constrain the nonlinear effects of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories on cosmological scales. Applying this analysis to the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12, we obtain the lower bounds of $-1.</description>

We propose a non-exotic electromagnetic solution to the cosmological $^7$Li problem based upon a 2 MeV photo-emission line from color superconducting quark nuggets (CSCQN) that destroys Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) $^7$Be without affecting other abundances or Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) physics. Conversion of CSCQN gluonic (rest-mass) energy to 2 MeV photons in the radiation-dominated post-BBN epoch reduces the primordial abundance of $^7$Be (and thus cosmological $^7$Li) by 2/3, provided the combined mass of the nuggets is greater than the total baryonic mass in the Universe.</description>

It is expected that cosmic rays (CRs) escape from high-redshift galaxies at redshift $z\sim 10 \, - \, 20$ because CRs are accelerated by supernova remnants of the first stars. Although ultraviolet and X-ray photons are widely considered the main source of heating of the intergalactic medium, CRs can also contribute to it. When the CRs propagate in the intergalactic medium, in addition to the heating process due to CR ionization, resistive heating occurs due to the electron return current induced by the streaming CRs.</description>

Blind cleaning methods are currently the preferred strategy for handling foreground contamination in single-dish HI intensity mapping surveys. Despite the increasing sophistication of blind techniques, some signal loss will be inevitable across all scales. Constructing a corrective transfer function using mock signal injection into the contaminated data has been a practice relied on for HI intensity mapping experiments. However, assessing whether this approach is viable for future intensity mapping surveys where precision cosmology is the aim, remains unexplored.</description>

We present JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Spectrograph rest-frame optical data of the compact $z=5.55$ galaxy GS_3073. Its prominent broad components in several hydrogen and helium lines (while absent in the forbidden lines), and the detection of a large equivalent width of He II $\lambda4686$, EW(He II) $\sim20$ Angstrom, unambiguously identify it as an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We measure a gas-phase metallicity of $Z_{\rm gas}/Z_\odot\sim0.21^{+0.08}{-0.04}$, lower than what has been inferred for both more luminous AGN at similar redshift and lower redshift AGN.</description>

The 21-cm power spectrum of reionization is a promising probe for cosmology and fundamental physics.

In this paper, we introduce the halo model of reionization (HMreio), a new analytical tool that combines the halo model of the cosmic dawn with the excursion-set bubble model for reionization, assuming an empirical correction factor to deal with overlapping ionization bubbles.</description>

With Faraday rotation of polarised background sources, we aim to detect a possible excess of the rotation measure in the surrounding area of nearby galaxies.</description>

Dwarf galaxies are characterised by a very low luminosity and low mass. Because of significant accretion and ejection activity of massive black holes, some dwarf galaxies also host low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In a few dwarf AGNs, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations have found faint non-thermal radio emission. SDSS J090613.77+561015.2 is a dwarf AGN owning an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of $M_{BH} = 3.</description>

Single field inflationary models are investigated within Palatini quadratic gravity represented by $R+\alpha R^2$ along with a non-minimal coupling of the form $f(\phi) R$ between the inflaton field $\phi$ and the gravity. The treatment is performed in the Einstein frame, where the minimal coupling to gravity is recovered through conformal transformation. We consider various limits of the model with different inflationary scenarios characterized as canonical slow-roll inflation in the limit $\alpha \dot{\phi}^2\ll (1+f(\phi)) $, constant-roll k-inflation for $\alpha \ll 1$, and slow-roll K-inflation for$ \alpha \gg 1$ .</description>

The assembly history of the Milky Way (MW) is a rapidly evolving subject, with numerous small accretion events and at least one major merger proposed in the MW&amp;amp;#39;s history. Accreted alongside these dwarf galaxies are globular clusters (GCs), which act as spatially coherent remnants of these past events. Using high precision differential abundance measurements from our recently published study, we investigate the likelihood that the MW clusters NGC 362 and NGC 288 are galactic siblings, accreted as part of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger.</description>

      <description>First author: Dayi Li
We propose a novel set of Poisson Cluster Process models to detect Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs), a recently-discovered class of galaxies that are challenging to detect and are of substantial interests in modern astrophysics. We construct an improved spatial birth-death-move MCMC algorithm to make inferences about the locations of these otherwise un-observable galaxies. Our novel models significantly out-perform existing approaches based on the Log-Gaussian Cox Process; the novel marked point process we propose can also improve the detection performance for UDGs in noisy environments.</description>

      <description>First author: Darius McAdam
The distribution of the spin directions of spiral galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has been a topic of debate in the past two decades, with conflicting conclusions reported even in cases where the same data was used. Here we follow one of the previous experiments by applying the SpArcFiRe algorithm to annotate the spin directions in original dataset of Galaxy Zoo 1. The annotation of the galaxy spin directions is done after a first step of selecting the spiral galaxies in three different manners: manual analysis by Galaxy Zoo classifications, by a model-driven computer analysis, and with no selection of spiral galaxies.</description>

      <description>First author: Ilin Lazar
How elliptical galaxies form is a key question in observational cosmology. While the formation of massive ellipticals is strongly linked to mergers, the low mass (Mstar &amp;lt; 10^9.5 MSun) regime remains less well explored. In particular, studying elliptical populations when they are blue, and therefore rapidly building stellar mass, offers strong constraints on their formation. Here, we study 108 blue, low-mass ellipticals (which have a median stellar mass of 10^8.</description>

      <description>First author: Chris Hamilton
Spiral density waves can arise in galactic disks as linear instabilities of the underlying stellar distribution function. Such instabilities grow exponentially in amplitude at some fixed growth rate $\beta$ before saturating nonlinearly. However, the mechanisms behind nonlinear saturation, and the resulting saturated spiral amplitude, have not received much attention. Here we argue that the most important nonlinear saturation mechanism is likely trapping of stars near the spiral&amp;rsquo;s corotation resonance.</description>

Thanks to the superb image quality and wide area coverage of the Sextans field, the HSC data enables a secure selection of member star candidates based on the colour-magnitude cut, yielding about 10,000 member candidates at magnitudes down to $i\sim 24$.</description>

The observed properties of galaxies are strongly dependent on both their total stellar mass and their morphology. Furthermore, the environment is known to play a strong role in shaping them. The galaxy population in the local universe that is located in virialized clusters is found to be red, poorly star-forming, and mostly composed of early morphological types. Towards a holistic understanding of the mechanisms that drive galaxy evolution, we exploit the spectrophotometric data from the WINGS and OmegaWINGS local galaxy cluster surveys, and study the role of both the local and the large-scale environments.</description>

      <description>First author: A. Acharyya
Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a rare class of stellar explosions with luminosities ~10-100 times greater than ordinary core-collapse supernovae. One popular model to explain the enhanced optical output of hydrogen-poor (Type I) SLSNe invokes energy injection from a rapidly spinning magnetar. A prediction in this case is that high-energy gamma rays, generated in the wind nebula of the magnetar, could escape through the expanding supernova ejecta at late times (months or more after optical peak).</description>

The goal of this work is to search for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the Galactic disc at very low latitudes with |b| $&amp;lt;$ 2$^\circ$. For this, we studied the five sources from the VVV near-infrared galaxy catalogue that have also WISE counterparts and present variability in the VIrac VAriable Classification Ensemble (VIVACE) catalogue. In the near-infrared colour-colour diagrams, these objects have in general redder colours compared to the rest of the sources in the field.</description>

Aim. The satellite systems of Milky-Way-like galaxies offer a useful means by which to study the galaxy formation process in the cosmological context. It has been suggested that the currently observed anisotropic distribution of the satellites in such galaxy systems is inconsistent with the concordant $\Lambda CDM$ cosmology model on the galactic scale if the observed satellites are random samples of the dark matter (DM) sub-halos that are nearly isotropically distributed around the central galaxy.</description>

We report the discovery of a new stream (dubbed as Yangtze) detected in $Gaia$ Data Release 3. The stream is at a heliocentric distance of $\sim$ 9.12 kpc and spans nearly 27$°$ by 1.9$°$ on sky. The colour-magnitude diagram of Yangtze indicates a stellar population of Age $\sim$ 11 Gyr and $[M/H]$ $\sim$ -0.7 dex. It has a number density of about 5.5 stars degree$^{-2}$ along with a surface brightness of $Σ_G \simeq$ 34.</description>

Interstellar dust captures a significant fraction of elements heavier than helium in the solid state and is an indispensable component both in theory and observations of galaxy evolution. Dust emission is generally the primary coolant of the interstellar medium (ISM) and facilitates the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of gas clouds from which stars form, while altering the emission spectrum of galaxies from ultraviolet (UV) to far-infrared wavelengths through the reprocessing of starlight.</description>

By modelling the distribution of observed cluster mass for a given true mass to be log-normal and adopting a selection threshold in the observed mass $M_{200m} \geq 0.836 \times 10^{14} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, we find about $4.1 \times 10^{5}$ clusters in the redshift range $0 \leq z \leq 1.</description>

We recently introduced a new method for simulating collisional gravitational N-body systems with approximately linear time scaling with $N$, based on the Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) scheme, previously applied in Plasma Physics. We simulate globular clusters with a realistic number of stellar particles (at least up to several times $10^6$) on a standard workstation. We simulate clusters hosting an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH), probing a broad range of BH-cluster and BH-average-star mass ratios, unrestricted by the computational constraints affecting direct N-body codes.</description>

Spectroscopic reverberation mapping (RM) is a direct approach widely used to estimate the mass of black holes (BHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, it is very time-consuming and difficult to apply to a large AGN sample. The empirical relation between the broad-line region (BLR) size and luminosity (H$\beta$ $R_{\rm BLR}\unicode{x2013}L_{\rm}$) provides a practical alternative yet subject to large scatter and systematic bias. AGN continuum RM (CRM) recently discovered a similar relation between the continuum emitting region (CER) size and luminosity ($R_{\rm CER}\unicode{x2013}L$).</description>

In this Letter, we report the outcomes of 1-D modelling of a rotating 25 M$_{\odot}$ zero-age main-sequence Population III star up to the stage of the onset of core collapse. Rapidly rotating models display violent and sporadic mass losses after the Main-Sequence stage. In comparison to the solar metallicity model, Pop III models show very small pre-supernova radii. Further, with models at the stage of the onset of core collapse, we simulate the hydrodynamic simulations of resulting supernovae.</description>

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are explosions of white dwarf stars that facilitate exquisite measurements of cosmological expansion history, but improvements in accuracy and precision are hindered by observational biases. Of particular concern is the apparent difference in the corrected brightnesses of SNe Ia in different host galaxy environments. SNe Ia in more massive, passive, older environments appear brighter after having been standardized by their light-curve properties.</description>

We study the bar pattern speeds and corotation radii of 225 barred galaxies, using IFU data from MaNGA and the Tremaine-Weinberg method. Our sample, which is divided between strongly and weakly barred galaxies identified via Galaxy Zoo, is the largest that this method has been applied to. We find lower pattern speeds for strongly barred galaxies than for weakly barred galaxies. As simulations show that the pattern speed decreases as the bar exchanges angular momentum with its host, these results suggest that strong bars are more evolved than weak bars.</description>

We present jax-cosmo, a library for automatically differentiable cosmological theory calculations. It uses the JAX library, which has created a new coding ecosystem, especially in probabilistic programming. As well as batch acceleration, just-in-time compilation, and automatic optimization of code for different hardware modalities (CPU, GPU, TPU), JAX exposes an automatic differentiation (autodiff) mechanism. Thanks to autodiff, jax-cosmo gives access to the derivatives of cosmological likelihoods with respect to any of their parameters, and thus enables a range of powerful Bayesian inference algorithms, otherwise impractical in cosmology, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Variational Inference.</description>

In this paper, we present the formalism of simulating Lyman-$α$ emission and polarization around reionization ($z$ = 8) from a plane-parallel ionization front. We accomplish this by using a Monte Carlo method to simulate the production of a Lyman-$α$ photon, its propagation through an ionization front, and the eventual escape of this photon. This paper focuses on the relation of the input parameters of ionization front speed $U$, blackbody temperature $T_{\rm bb}$, and neutral hydrogen density $n_{\rm HI}$, on intensity $I$ and polarized intensity $P$ as seen by a distant observer.</description>

      <description>First author: M. Ballardini
We study three different extended scalar-tensor theories of gravity by also allowing a negative sign for the kinetic term for the scalar field in the Jordan frame. Our scope is to understand how the observational constraints for these models cope with the volume of the parameter space in which the theory is healthy. Models with a negative kinetic term lead to decreasing effective gravitational constant with redshift and behave as an effective relativistic component with a negative energy density as opposite to their corresponding version with a standard kinetic term.</description>

We use the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5 year catalogue of photometrically-classified type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to identify 70 SNe Ia that have occurred within red-sequence selected clusters of galaxies. We compare the cluster SN light-curve properties and environmental properties to 1020 DES SNe Ia located in the field, the largest comparison of two such samples to date. We find an tentative indication (98.5 per cent confidence level) that, on average, SNe Ia located in galaxy clusters are faster declining compared to those located in the field.</description>

Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are among the most massive galaxies in the Universe. Their star formation (SF) history and stellar mass assembly are debated. Recent studies suggest the presence of an emerging population of intermediate-$z$ star forming and gas-rich BCGs, where the molecular gas reservoirs are impacted by strong environmental processing. We have selected three among the most star-forming $z\sim0.4$ BCGs in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and observed them with the IRAM 30m telescope in the first three CO transitions.</description>

We present a comprehensive catalog of observations and stellar population properties for 23 highly secure host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Our sample comprises six repeating FRBs and 17 apparent non-repeaters. We present 82 new photometric and eight new spectroscopic observations of these hosts. Using stellar population synthesis modeling and employing non-parametric star formation histories (SFHs), we find that FRB hosts have a median stellar mass of $\approx 10^{9.</description>

      <description>First author: P. A. Chernikov
In the presented work we consider the influence of a hypothetical sterile neutrino (with eV-scale mass) on the determination of cosmological parameters. If it is detected, it will be necessary to include it into the $\Lambda \rm CDM$ model with the fixed values of its mass $m_{\rm s}$ and mixing angle $\theta_{s}$, which is the main method used through this paper. Apart from that, the seesaw mechanism requires there to be at least two sterile states, one of them being much heavier than the active ones.</description>

With the calculated guiding center radius $R_{guiding}$ and birth radius $R_{birth}$, we investigate the role of radial migration on the description of lithium evolution in the Galactic disk based on the upper envelope of the A(Li) vs. $[Fe/H]$ diagram. Using migration distances, we find that stars in the solar neighborhood are born at different locations in the galactic disk, and cannot all be explained by models of chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <description>First author: Anderson Caproni
Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations are commonly used to study the evolution of the gaseous content in isolated galaxies, besides its connection with galactic star formation histories. Stellar winds, supernova blasts, and black hole feedback are mechanisms usually invoked to drive galactic outflows and decrease the initial galactic gas reservoir. However, any simulation imposes the need of choosing the limits of the simulated volume, which depends, for instance, on the size of the galaxy and the required numerical resolution, besides the available computational capability to perform it.</description>

The phenomenon of cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) is expected to occur during the period of inflation and the transition into a hot big bang cosmology. Particles may be produced even if they only couple directly to gravity, and so CGPP provides a natural explanation for the origin of dark matter. In this work we study the gravitational production of massive spin-2 particles assuming two different couplings to matter.</description>

We present a framework for self-consistent cosmological analyses of the full-shape anisotropic bispectrum, including the quadrupole $(\ell=2)$ and hexadecapole $(\ell=4)$ moments. This features a novel window-free algorithm for extracting the latter quantities from data, derived using a maximum-likelihood prescription. Furthermore, we introduce a theoretical model for the bispectrum multipoles (which does not introduce new free parameters), and test both aspects of the pipeline on several high-fidelity mocks, including the PT Challenge suite of gigantic cumulative volume.</description>

      <description>Edoardo Altamura
Recent high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with a variety of codes systematically predict large amounts of entropy in the intra-cluster medium at low redshift, leading to flat entropy profiles and a suppressed cool-core population. This prediction is at odds with X-ray observations of groups and clusters. We use a new implementation of the EAGLE galaxy formation model to investigate the sensitivity of the central entropy and the shape of the profiles to changes in the sub-grid model applied to a suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations of a group of mass $M_{500} = 8.</description>

Kilo-parsec scale hard ($&amp;gt;$ 3 keV) X-ray continuum and fluorescent Fe K$\alpha$ line emission has been recently discovered in nearby Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nuclei (AGN), which opens new opportunities to improve AGN torus modeling and investigate how the central supermassive black hole interacts with and impacts the host galaxy. Following a pilot Chandra survey of nearby CT AGN, we present in this paper the Chandra spatial analysis results of five uniformly selected non-CT but still heavily obscured AGN to investigate the extended hard X-ray emission by measuring the excess emission counts, excess fractions, and physical scales.</description>

Early photometric results from JWST have revealed a number of galaxy candidates above redshift 10. The initial estimates of inferred stellar masses and the associated cosmic star formation rates are above most theoretical model predictions up to a factor of 20 in the most extreme cases, while this has been moderated after the recalibration of NIRCam and subsequent spectroscopic detections. Using these recent JWST observations, we use galaxy scaling relations from cosmological simulations to model the star formation history to very high redshifts, back to a starting halo mass of 10^7 solar masses, to infer the intrinsic properties of the JWST galaxies.</description>

With mock strong gravitational lensing images, we investigate the performance of broken power-law (BPL) model on the mass reconstruction of galaxy-scale lenses. An end-to-end test is carried out, including the creation of mock strong lensing images, the subtraction of lens light, and the reconstruction of lensed images. Based on these analyses, we can reliably evaluate how accurate the lens mass and source light distributions can be measured.</description>

Globular clusters display an anticorrelation between the fraction of the first generation of stars ($N({\rm G1})/N({\rm tot})$) and the slope of the present-day mass function of the clusters ($α_{pd}$), which is particularly significant for massive clusters. In the framework of the binary-mediated collision scenario for the formation of the second-generation stars in globular clusters, we test the effect of a varying stellar initial mass function (IMF) of the G1 stars on the $(N({\rm G1})/N({\rm tot}))-α_{pd}$ anticorrelation.</description>

We present a series of ground-based photometry and spectroscopy of the superluminous Type IIn supernova (SN) ASASSN-15ua, which shows evidence for strong interaction with pre-existing dense circumstellar material (CSM). Our observations constrain the speed, mass-loss rate, and extent of the progenitor wind shortly before explosion. A narrow P Cygni absorption component reveals a progenitor wind speed of $\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$. As observed in previous SNe IIn, the intermediate-width H$\alpha$ emission became progressively more asymmetric and blueshifted, suggesting either an asymmetric CSM, an asymmetric explosion, or increasing selective extinction from dust within the post-shock shell or SN ejecta.</description>

Neutrinos allow the probing of stellar interiors during core collapse, helping to understand the different stages and processes in the collapse. To date, supernova neutrinos have only been detected from a single event, SN1987A. Most studies from then on have focused on two distance extremes: Galactic/local supernovae and all past cosmic supernovae forming the diffuse supernova neutrino background. We focus on the intermediate distance regime as a target for detecting core-collapse supernova neutrinos at next generation detectors like Hyper-Kamiokande.</description>

Characterizing the physical conditions (density, temperature, ionization state, metallicity, etc) of the interstellar medium is critical to our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies. Here we present a multi-line study of the interstellar medium in the host galaxy of a quasar at z~6.4, i.e., when the universe was 840 Myr old. This galaxy is one of the most active and massive objects emerging from the dark ages, and therefore represents a benchmark for models of the early formation of massive galaxies.</description>

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) serendipitously detected H$2$O $J{Ka, Kc} = 10_{2,9} - 9_{3,6}$ emission at 321 GHz in NGC 1052. This is the first submillimeter maser detection in a radio galaxy and the most luminous 321-GHz H$2$O maser known to date with the isotropic luminosity of 1090 $L{\odot}$. The line profile consists of a broad velocity component with FWHM $= 208 \pm 12$ km s$^{-1}$ straddling the systemic velocity and a narrow component with FWHM $= 44 \pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$ blueshifted by 160 km s$^{-1}$.</description>

The X-shooter Spectral Library (XSL) is a large empirical stellar library used as a benchmark for the development of stellar population models. The inclusion of $\alpha$-elements abundances is crucial to disentangling the chemical evolution of any stellar system. The aim of this paper is to provide a catalogue of high-precision and accurate magnesium and calcium abundances from a wide variety of stars well distributed in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram.</description>

We present a detailed analysis of the elemental abundances distribution of the Virgo cluster using {\it XMM-Newton} observations. We included in the analysis a new EPIC-pn energy scale calibration which allow us to measure velocities with uncertainties down to $\Delta v \sim 150$ km/s. We investigate the radial distribution of O, Ne, Mg, Si, Ar, S, Ca, Ni and Fe. We found that the best-fit model is close to a single-temperature component for distances $&amp;gt;80$~kpc and the cooler gas is more metal-rich.</description>

The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is very useful for processing signals with intricate and irregular structures in astrophysics and cosmology. It is crucial to propose precise and fast algorithms for the CWT. In this work, we review and compare four different fast CWT algorithms for the 1D signals, including the FFTCWT, the V97CWT, the M02CWT, and the A19CWT. The FFTCWT algorithm implements the CWT using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\log_2N)$ per scale.</description>

Could Machine Learning (ML) make fundamental discoveries and tackle unsolved problems in Cosmology? Detailed observations of the present contents of the universe are consistent with the Cosmological Constant Lambda and Cold Dark Matter model, subject to some unresolved inconsistencies (&amp;rsquo;tensions&amp;rsquo;) among observations of the Hubble Constant and the clumpiness factor. To understand these issues further, large surveys of billions of galaxies and other probes require new statistical approaches.</description>

We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the extraordinary gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A in search of an associated supernova. Some past GRBs have shown bumps in the optical light curve that coincide with the emergence of supernova spectral features, but we do not detect any significant light curve features in GRB~221009A, nor do we detect any clear sign of supernova spectral features.

We study a sample of 936 early-type galaxies (ETGs) located in 48 low-z regular galaxy clusters with $M_{200}\geq 10^{14}~ M_\odot$ at $z&amp;lt; 0.1$. We examine variations in the concentration index, radius, and color gradient of ETGs as a function of their stellar mass and loci in the projected phase space (PPS) of the clusters. We aim to understand the environmental influence on the growth of ETGs according to the time since infall into their host clusters.</description>

The galaxy distribution in dark matter-dominated halos is expected to approximately trace the details of the underlying dark matter substructure. In this paper we introduce halo `core-tracking&amp;rsquo; as a way to efficiently follow the small-scale substructure in cosmological simulations and apply the technique to model the galaxy distribution in observed clusters. The method relies on explicitly tracking the set of particles identified as belonging to a halo&amp;rsquo;s central density core, once a halo has attained a certain threshold mass.</description>

We investigate the sensitivity of a universe&amp;rsquo;s nuclear entropy after Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) to variations in both the baryon-to-photon ratio and the temporal evolution of cosmological expansion. Specifically, we construct counterfactual cosmologies to quantify the degree by which these two parameters must vary from those in our Universe before we observe a substantial change in the degree of fusion, and thus nuclear entropy, during BBN.</description>

We present a self-consistent prediction of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF), from the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) to sub-mm range, based on two chemical evolution models of a Milky Way-like galaxy (MWG). To this end, we develop a new tool called Mixclask to include gas emission, absorption and scattering from the photoionization code Cloudy into the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Skirt. Both algorithms are invoked iteratively, until the physical properties of the ISM converge.</description>

      <description>Yuka Doke
One of the most intriguing properties of the GD-1 stellar stream is the existence of three gaps. If these gaps were formed by close encounters with dark matter subhalos, the GD-1 stream opens an exciting window through which we can see the size, mass, and velocity distributions of the dark matter subhalos in the Milky Way. However, in order to use the GD-1 stream as a probe of the dark matter substructure, we need to disprove that these gaps are not due to the perturbations from baryonic components of the Milky Way.</description>

We model the GI correlations in an N-body simulation with our recent accurate stellar-halo mass relation from the Photometric object Around Cosmic webs (PAC) method. The large data set and our accurate modeling turns out an accurate measurement of the alignment angle between central galaxies and their host halos.</description>

Nebular HeII$\lambda$4686\AA~line emission is useful to unveil active galactic nuclei (AGN) residing in actively star-forming (SF) galaxies, typically missed by the standard BPT classification. Here we adopt the HeII diagnostic to identify hidden AGN in the Local Universe using for the first time spatially-resolved data from the Data Release 15 of the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO survey (MaNGA DR15). By combining results from HeII and BPT diagnostics, we overall select 459 AGN host candidates ($\sim$10% in MaNGA DR15), out of which 27 are identified as AGN by the HeII diagram only.</description>

The amount of baryons hosted in the disks of galaxies is lower than expected based on the mass of their dark-matter halos and the fraction of baryon-to-total matter in the universe, giving rise to the so called galaxy missing-baryon problem. The presence of cool circum-galactic matter gravitationally bound to its galaxy&amp;rsquo;s halo up to distances of at least ten times the size of the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s disk, mitigates the problem but is far from being sufficient for its solution.</description>

Elliptical galaxies with blue optical colours and significant star formation are hypothesised to be major merger remnants of gas rich spiral galaxies or normal elliptical galaxies with a sudden burst of star formation. We present here a scenario where blue elliptical galaxies identified from shallow imaging surveys may fail to recover faint features indicative of a past merger activity using a nearby major merger remnant. Based on deep optical imaging data of a post merger galaxy, NGC 7252, we demonstrate that the galaxy can appear as an elliptical galaxy if observed at higher redshifts.</description>

We construct 3D emissivity maps of the $[Fe I]$ 1.443 $\mu$m line from the inner ejecta and the He I 1.083 $\mu$m line from the reverse shock (RS), where the former probes the explosion geometry and the latter traces the structure of the circumstellar medium.</description>

Low earth orbit and lunar missions within the European Space Agency&amp;rsquo;s Human and Robotic Exploration programme can push our knowledge forward in all of these three fields. A radio interferometer on the Moon, a cold atom interferometer in low earth orbit and a gravitational wave interferometer on the Moon are highlighted as the most fruitful missions to plan and execute in the mid-term.</description>

Star formation and stellar feedback are interlinked processes that redistribute energy and matter throughout galaxies. When young, massive stars form in spatially clustered environments, they create pockets of expanding gas termed superbubbles. As these processes play a critical role in shaping galaxy discs and regulating the baryon cycle, measuring the properties of superbubbles provides important input for galaxy evolution models. With wide coverage and high angular resolution ($\sim$50-150 pc) of the PHANGS-ALMA $^{12}$CO (2-1) survey, we can now resolve and identify a statistically representative number of superbubbles with molecular gas in nearby galaxies.</description>

Thin stellar discs on both galactic and nuclear, sub-kpc scales are believed to be fragile structures that would be easily destroyed in major mergers. In turn, this makes the age-dating of their stellar populations a useful diagnostics for the assembly history of galaxies. We aim at carefully exploring the fragility of such stellar discs in intermediate- and low- mass encounters, using high-resolution N-body simulations of galaxy models with structural and kinematic properties tailored to actually observed galaxies.</description>

Recent models for the inner structure of active galactic nuclei (AGN) advocate the presence of a radiatively accelerated, dusty outflow launched from the outer regions of the accretion disk. Here we present the first near-infrared (near-IR) variable (rms) spectrum for the high-luminosity, nearby AGN Mrk 876. We find that it tracks the accretion disk spectrum out to longer wavelengths than the mean spectrum due to a reduced dust emission.</description>

We use the BOSS DR12 galaxy power spectrum to constrain compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIP), which are opposite-sign primordial baryon and dark matter perturbations that leave the total matter density unchanged. Long-wavelength CIP $\sigma(\vec{x})$ enter the galaxy density contrast as $\delta_g(\vec{x}) \supset b_\sigma\sigma(\vec{x})$, with $b_\sigma$ the linear CIP galaxy bias parameter. We parameterize the CIP spectra as $P_{\sigma\sigma} = A^2P_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}}$ and $P_{\sigma\mathcal{R}} = \xi\sqrt{P_{\sigma\sigma}P_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}}}$, where $A$ is the CIP amplitude and $\xi$ is the correlation with the curvature perturbations $\mathcal{R}$.</description>

We report the second extragalactic pulsar wind nebula (PWN) to be detected in the MeV-GeV band by the Fermi-LAT, located within the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The only other known PWN to emit in the Fermi band outside of the Milky Way Galaxy is N 157B which lies to the west of the newly detected gamma-ray emission at an angular distance of 4 degrees. Faint, point-like gamma-ray emission is discovered at the location of the composite supernova remnant (SNR) B0453-685 with a ~ 4 sigma significance from energies 300 MeV - 2 TeV.</description>

Models of radio galaxy physics have been primarily based on high frequency ($\geqslant$1 GHz) observations of their jets, hotspots, and lobes. Without highly resolved low frequency observations, which provide information on older plasma, our understanding of the dynamics of radio galaxies and their interaction with their environment is limited. Here, we present the first sub-arcsecond (0.3&amp;quot;) resolution images at 144 MHz of two powerful radio galaxies situated in rich cluster environments, namely 3C 34 and 3C 320, using the International Low Frequency Array Telescope.</description>

The fundamental constants in Nature play a crucial role in the understanding of physical phenomena. Hence, it is of paramount importance to measure them with exquisite precision and to examine whether they present any variability across cosmic time, as a means to test the standard model of Cosmology, as well as fundamental physics. We revisit a consistency test of the speed of light variability proposed by Cai {\it et al.</description>

We present new upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) HI 21-cm observations of the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy IRAS 10565+2448, previously reported to show blueshifted, broad, and shallow HI absorption indicating an outflow. Our higher spatial resolution observations have localised this blueshifted outflow, which is $\sim$ 1.36 kpc southwest of the radio centre and has a blueshifted velocity of $\sim 148,\rm km,s^{-1}$ and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\sim 581,\rm km,s^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>First author: Nhat-Minh Nguyen
We present evidence for a suppressed growth rate of large-scale structure during the dark-energy dominated era. Modeling the growth rate of perturbations with the ``growth index&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; $\gamma$, we find that current cosmological data strongly prefer a higher growth index than the value $\gamma=0.55$ predicted by general relativity in a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Both the cosmic microwave background data from Planck and the large-scale structure data from weak lensing, galaxy clustering, and cosmic velocities separately favor growth suppression.</description>

We present the results of our study of the X-ray emission from the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster based on INTEGRAL/IBIS data in the energy range 20-120 keV. Our goal is the search for a nonthermal emission component from the cluster. Using the INTEGRAL data over the period of observations 2003-2009, we have constructed the images of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster in different energy bands from 20 to 120~keV with the extraction of spectral information.</description>

We develop a new model within which the radius-dependent transition of the galaxy inner spins with respect to the cosmic web and the variation of the transition threshold radius ($r_{\rm th}$) with galaxy mass ($M_{\rm vir}$), smoothing scale ($r_{f}$), and redshift ($z$) can be coherently explained. The key tenet of this model is that the competition between the pressure effect of the inner mass and the compression effect of the local tidal field determines which principal direction of the tidal field the inner spins are aligned with.</description>

Studies indicate strong evidence of a scaling relation in the local Universe between the supermassive black hole mass ($M_\rm{BH}$) and the stellar mass of their host galaxies ($M_\star$). They even show similar histories across cosmic times of their differential terms: star formation rate (SFR) and black hole accretion rate (BHAR). However, a clear picture of this coevolution is far from being understood. We select an X-ray sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) up to $z=2.</description>

Many disc galaxies host galactic bars, which exert time-dependent, non-axisymmetric forces that can alter the orbits of stars. There should be both angle and radius-dependence in the resulting radial re-arrangement of stars (&amp;lsquo;radial mixing&amp;rsquo;) due to a bar; we present here novel results and trends through analysis of the joint impact of these factors. We use an N-body simulation to investigate the changes in the radial locations of star particles in a disc after a bar forms by quantifying the change in orbital radii in a series of annuli at different times post bar-formation.</description>

We use topological summaries based on Betti curves to characterize the large-scale spatial distribution of simulated dark matter haloes and galaxies. Using the IllustrisTNG and CAMELS-SAM simulations, we show that the topology of the galaxy distribution is significantly different from the topology of the dark matter halo distribution. Further, there are significant differences between the distributions of star-forming and quiescent galaxies. These topological differences are broadly consistent across all simulations, while at the same time there are noticeable differences when comparing between different models.</description>

The currently used standardisation of type Ia supernovae results in Hubble residuals whose physical origin is unaccounted for. This poses a limitation to the accuracy and precision of distances that can be derived from supernova observations. Here, we present a complete physical interpretation of the Hubble residuals based on a novel Bayesian hierarchical model of type Ia supernovae in which latent variables describing intrinsic and extrinsic (dust related) supernova properties originate from two populations.</description>

We explore the properties of the host galaxies of X-ray selected AGN in the COSMOS field using the Chandra Legacy sample and the LEGA-C survey VLT optical spectra. Our main goal is to compare the relative ages of the host galaxies of the obscured and unobscured AGN by means of the calcium break Dn(4000) and the Hdelta Balmer line. The host galaxy ages are examined in conjunction with other properties such as the galaxy stellar mass, and star-formation rate as well as the AGN Eddington ratio.</description>

Low mass galaxies in the Local Group are dominated by dark matter and comprise the well studied dwarf Spheroidal&amp;quot; (dSph) class, with typical masses of $10^{9-10}M_\odot$ and also the equally numerous ultra faint dwarfs&amp;quot; (UFD), discovered recently, that are distinctly smaller and denser with masses of only $10^{7-8}M_\odot$. This bimodality amongst low mass galaxies contrasts with the scale free continuity expected for galaxies formed under gravity, as in the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model for heavy particles.</description>

The photometric catalogue of galaxy clusters extracted from ESA Euclid data is expected to be very competitive for cosmological studies. Using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, we present systematic analyses simulating the expected weak lensing profiles from clusters in a variety of dynamic states and at wide range of redshifts. In order to derive cluster masses, we use a model consistent with the implementation within the Euclid Consortium of the dedicated processing function and find that, when jointly modelling mass and the concentration parameter of the Navarro-Frenk-White halo profile, the weak lensing masses tend to be, on average, biased low with respect to the true mass.</description>

We use an asteroseismology method to calculate the frequencies of gravitational waves in a long-term core-collapse supernova simulation, with a mass of 9.6 $M_\odot$. The simulation, which includes neutrino transport in general relativity is performed from core-collapse, bounce, explosion and cooling of protoneutron stars (PNSs) up to 20 s after the bounce self-consistently. Based on the hydrodynamics background, we calculate eigenmodes of the PNS oscillation through a perturbation analysis on fluid and metric.</description>

While the direct detection of the dark-matter particle remains very challenging, the nature of dark matter could be possibly constrained by comparing the observed abundance and properties of small-scale sub-galactic mass structures with predictions from the phenomenological dark-matter models, such as cold, warm or hot dark matter. Galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing provides a unique opportunity to search for tiny surface-brightness anomalies in the extended lensed images (i.</description>

We complement this data set with publicly available images of lower excitation lines of HCN, HCO$^+$, and CO and analyse the behaviour of a representative set of line ratios: HCN(3-2)/HCN(1-0), HCN(3-2)/HCO$^+$(3-2), HCN(1-0)/CO(2-1), and HCN(3-2)/CO(2-1).</description>

We present an analytic model for the cool, $T \approx 10^4$ K, circumgalactic medium (CGM), describing the gas distribution, thermal and ionization state. Our model assumes (total) pressure equilibrium with the ambient warm/hot CGM, photoionization by the metagalactic radiation field, and allows for non-thermal pressure support, parametrized by the ratio of thermal pressures, $\eta = P_{\rm hot,th}/P_{\rm cool,th}$. We apply the model to the COS-Halos data set and find that a nominal model with $\eta = 3$, gas distribution out to $r \approx 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Keiya Hirashima
Small integration timesteps for a small fraction of short-timescale regions are bottlenecks for high-resolution galaxy simulations using massively parallel computing. This is an urgent issue that needs to be resolved for future higher-resolution galaxy simulations. One possible solution is to use an (approximate) Hamiltonian splitting method, in which only regions requiring small timesteps are integrated with small timesteps, separated from the entire galaxy. In particular, gas affected by supernova (SN) explosions often requires the smallest timestep in such a simulation.</description>

Ultra-stripped supernovae are different from other terminal explosions of massive stars, as they show little or no ejecta from the actual supernova event. They are thought to occur in massive binary systems after the exploding star has lost its surface through interactions with its companion. Such supernovae produce little to no kick, leading to the formation of a neutron star without loss of the binary companion, which itself may also evolve into another neutron star.</description>

The chemical composition of gas in galaxies can be measured in detail from absorption spectroscopy. By studying gas in galaxies in this way, it is possible to investigate the small and faint galaxies, which are the most numerous in the universe. In particular, the chemical distribution of gas in absorbing systems gives us insight into cycles of gas in and around galaxies. Here we study chemical enrichment within 64 Damped Lyman-alpha Absorption (DLA) systems between $1.</description>

We study the dynamics of cold molecular gas in two main-sequence galaxies at cosmic noon (zC-488879 at $z\simeq1.47$ and zC-400569 at $z\simeq2.24$) using new high-resolution ALMA observations of multiple $^{12}$CO transitions. For zC-400569 we also re-analyze high-quality H$\alpha$ data from the SINS/zC-SINF survey. We find that (1) Both galaxies have regularly rotating CO disks and their rotation curves are flat out to $\sim$8 kpc contrary to previous results pointing to outer declines in the rotation speed $V_{\rm rot}$; (2) The intrinsic velocity dispersions are low ($\sigma_{\rm CO}\lesssim15$ km/s for CO and $\sigma_{\rm H\alpha}\lesssim37$ km/s for H$\alpha$) and imply $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_{\rm CO}\gtrsim17-22$ yielding no significant pressure support; (3) Mass models using HST images display a severe disk-halo degeneracy: models with inner baryon dominance and models with &amp;ldquo;cuspy&amp;rdquo; dark matter halos can fit the rotation curves equally well due to the uncertainties on stellar and gas masses; (4) Milgromian dynamics (MOND) can successfully fit the rotation curves with the same acceleration scale $a_0$ measured at $z\simeq0$.</description>

We present the combination of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CHFT) Large Area $U$-bands Deep Survey (CLAUDS) and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) data over their four deep fields. We provide photometric catalogs for $u$, $u^*$ (CFHT&amp;ndash;MegaCam), $g$, $r$, $i$, $z$, and $y$ (Subaru&amp;ndash;HSC) bands over $\sim 20~{\rm deg}^2$, complemented in two fields by data from the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) Deep Extragalactic Observations (VIDEO) survey and the UltraVISTA survey, thus extending the wavelength coverage toward near-infrared with VIRCAM $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ observations over $5.</description>

The shear measurement from DECaLS (Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey) provides an excellent opportunity for galaxy-galaxy lensing study with DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) galaxies, given the large ($\sim 9000$ deg$^2$) sky overlap. We explore this potential by combining the DESI 1% survey and DECaLS DR8. With $\sim 106$ deg$^2$ sky overlap, we achieve significant detection of galaxy-galaxy lensing for BGS and LRG as lenses. Scaled to the full BGS sample, we expect the statistical errors to improve from $18(12)%$ to a promising level of $2(1.</description>

      <description>Alvaro Pozo,
Low mass galaxies in the Local Group are dominated by dark matter and comprise the well studied ``dwarf Spheroidal&amp;amp;#34; (dSph) class, with typical masses of $10^{9-10}M_\odot$ and also the equally numerous ``ultra faint dwarfs&amp;amp;#34; (UFD), discovered recently, that are distinctly smaller and denser with masses of only $10^{7-8}M_\odot$. This bimodality amongst low mass galaxies contrasts with the scale free continuity expected for galaxies formed under gravity, as in the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model for heavy particles.</description>

Addressing the discrepancy between the late and early time measurements of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, and the so-called $S_8$ parameter has been a challenge in precision cosmology. Several models are present to address these tensions, but very few of them can do so simultaneously. In the past, we have suggested Banks-Zaks/Unparticles as an emergent Dark Energy model and claimed that it can ameliorate the Hubble tension.</description>

We report on the discovery of two low-luminosity, broad-line AGN at $z&amp;gt;5$ identified using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CEERS Survey. We detect broad H$\alpha$ emission from both sources, with FWHM of $2038\pm286$ and $1807\pm207$ km s$^{-1}$, resulting in black hole (BH) masses that are 1-2 dex below that of existing samples of luminous quasars at $z&amp;gt;5$. The first source, CEERS 1670 at $z=5.242$, is 2-3 dex fainter than known quasars at similar redshifts and was previously identified as a candidate low-luminosity AGN based on its rest-frame optical SED.</description>

We use 28 quasar fields with high-resolution (HIRES and UVES) spectroscopy from the MUSE Analysis of Gas Around Galaxies survey to study the connection between Ly${\alpha}$ emitters (LAEs) and metal-enriched ionized gas traced by CIV in absorption at redshift $z\approx3-4$. In a sample of 220 CIV absorbers, we identify 143 LAEs connected to CIV gas within a line-of-sight separation ${\rm \pm 500,km,s^{-1}}$, equal to a detection rate of $36\pm 5$ per cent once we account for multiple LAEs connected to the same CIV absorber.</description>

In this work, we reconstruct the cosmological unified dark fluid model proposed previously by Elkhateeb \cite{Elkhateeb:2017oqy} in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. Utilizing the equivalence between the scalar-tensor theory and the $f(R)$ gravity theory, the scalar field for the dark fluid is obtained, whence the $f(R)$ function is extracted and its viability is discussed. The linear growth of matter perturbations on the low redshifts is studied in our constructed $f(R)$ function, and the results are in good agreement with those from the $\Lambda$CDM model for the dark universe.</description>

One of the few firm predictions of string theory is the existence of a massless scalar field coupled to gravity, the dilaton. In its presence, the value of the fundamental constants of the universe, such as the fine-structure constant, will vary with the time-dependent vacuum expectation value of this field, in direct violation of the Einstein Equivalence Principle. The \emph{runaway dilaton} proposed by Damour, Piazza, and Veneziano provides a physically motivated cosmological scenario which reconciles the existence of a massless dilaton with observations, while still providing non-standard and testable predictions.</description>

We present a simple phenomenological model of hadronic interaction between protons accelerated in an old supernova remnant (SNR) and cold protons situated within the associated molecular clouds (MCs). The accelerated protons from the old SNR escaped the SNR shock front, and got injected into the MCs at an earlier time, producing ultra high energy gamma-rays and neutrinos through inelastic proton-proton interaction. We also take into account the acceleration and subsequent escape of electrons from the SNR shock front.</description>

Despite the importance of AGN in galaxy evolution, accurate AGN identification is often challenging, as common AGN diagnostics can be confused by contributions from star formation and other effects (e.g., Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagrams). However, one promising avenue for identifying AGNs are coronal emission lines&amp;quot; (CLs&amp;quot;), which are highly ionized species of gas with ionization potentials $\ge$ 100 eV. These CLs may serve as excellent signatures for the strong ionizing continuum of AGN.</description>

The next generation of wide spectroscopic surveys such as Euclid will scan the sky in the near-infrared to obtain both photometry and spectroscopy. For this purpose, the Euclid telescope will rely on a Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instrument whose spectroscopic channel has been designed to operate in slitless configuration. This powerful and easy to operate configuration makes it possible to avoid any prior selection on the targeted galaxies while covering the entire field of view.</description>

Equations governing the evolution of a star involve multiple coupling constants. Thus, the time it spends as a main-sequence star can be expected to depend on whether or not such constants vary over the time scale of stellar evolution. When the star belongs to a globular cluster, the star&amp;amp;#39;s age cannot exceed that of the globular cluster, and the latter cannot exceed the age of the Universe.</description>

Spectral energy distribution (SED) models of galaxies at 0.3 &amp;lt;= z &amp;lt;= 2.5 were constructed to be processed by the Euclid spectroscopic channel simulator in order to investigate the Euclid Near- Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) capabilities. We developed a solid methodology to build a realistic and representative synthetic SED library of star-forming galaxies, including reliable emission line fluxes and widths. The construction of the SEDs consists in computing the continuum using the Bruzual &amp;amp; Charlot (2003) models, calling out SED fitting parameters available in publicly released multi-wavelength catalogues.</description>

JWST has now made it possible to probe the rest-frame optical line emission of high-redshift galaxies extending to z~9, and potentially beyond. To aid in the interpretation of these emerging constraints, in this work we explore predictions for $[OIII]$ emission in high-redshift galaxies using the First Light and Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES). We produce predictions for the $[OIII]$ luminosity function, its correlation with the UV luminosity, and the distribution of equivalent widths (EWs).</description>

High-spectral resolution observations of clusters of galaxies are a powerful tool to understand the physical processes taking place in these massive objects. Their hot multi-million-degree X-ray emitting cluster atmospheres, containing most of the baryons in these systems, are enriched to around 1/3 of the solar metallicity. Therefore, cluster spectra host a variety of spectral lines, in particular, the Fe-L complex around 1 keV typically emitted from cooler systems and Fe-K at 6.</description>

The data used are from the Large Area Telescope onboard the {\it Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}. We detect $γ$-ray pulsations of the MSP at a $4.4σ$ confidence level (the corresponding weighted H-test value is $\sim$28.4). This MSP, the fourth $γ$-ray pulsar found in a GC, does not have significant off-pulse emission and has $γ$-ray luminosity and efficiency $1.</description>

Given a \textit{model building} assumption on the (effective) equation of state (EoS) of the Universe, the Hubble constant $H_0$ arises as an integration constant when one solves the Friedmann equations. Therefore, while $H_0$ is \textit{mathematically} a constant, it need not be a constant \textit{observationally}, unless the EoS or model accurately describes the Universe. Building on earlier results, we show that redshift evolution of flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters $(H_0, \Omega_{m})$ persists in the most up-to-date Pantheon+ sample.</description>

Five stars in the extreme outskirts (from $\sim5$ to $\sim12$ elliptical half-light radii, r$_h$) of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf galaxy have been identified as potential new members using a Bayesian algorithm applied to \textit{Gaia} EDR3 data. These targets were observed with the GRACES spectrograph, resulting in precise radial velocities and metallicities that confirm their association with UMi.

Five stars in the extreme outskirts (from $\sim5$ to $\sim12$ elliptical half-light radii, r$_h$) of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf galaxy have been identified as potential new members using a Bayesian algorithm applied to \textit{Gaia} EDR3 data. These targets were observed with the GRACES spectrograph, resulting in precise radial velocities and metallicities that confirm their association with UMi. For the brightest and outermost star (Target~1, at $\sim12$ r$_h$), the chemical abundances of $\alpha$- (Mg, Ca, Ti), odd-Z (Na, K, Sc), Fe-peak (Fe, Ni, Cr), and neutron-capture process (Ba) elements have also been determined.</description>

The role of magnetic fields in galaxy evolution is still an unsolved question in astrophysics. We have previously shown that magnetic fields play a crucial role in major mergers between disc galaxies; in hydrodynamic simulations of such mergers, the Auriga model produces compact remnants with a distinctive bar and ring morphology. In contrast, in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, remnants form radially-extended discs with prominent spiral arm structure. In this paper, we analyse a series of cosmological &amp;amp;#34;zoom-in&amp;amp;#34; simulations of major mergers and identify exactly $\textit{how}$ magnetic fields are able to alter the outcome of the merger.</description>

The presence of an obscuring torus at pc-scale distances from the central black hole is the main ingredient for the Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), as obscured sources are thought to be seen through this structure. However, the Unified Model fails to describe a class of sources that undergo dramatic spectral changes, transitioning from obscured to unobscured and vice-versa through time. The variability in such sources, so-called Changing Look AGN (CLAGN), is thought to be produced by a clumpy medium at much smaller distances than the conventional obscuring torus.</description>

While interstellar gas is known to be supersonically turbulent, the injection processes of this turbulence are still unclear. Many studies suggest a dominant role of gravitational instabilities. However, their effect on galaxy morphology and large-scale dynamics vary across cosmic times, in particular due to the evolution of the gas fraction of galaxies. In this paper, we propose numerical simulations to follow the isothermal turbulent cascade of purely gravitationally-driven turbulence from its injection scale down to 0.</description>

      <description>Howard Baer,
The supersymmetrized DFSZ axion model is especially compelling in that it contains 1. the SUSY solution to the gauge hierarchy problem, 2. the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) solution to the strong CP problem and 3. the Kim-Nilles solution to the SUSY mu problem. In a string setting, where a discrete R-symmetry ({\bf Z}_{24}^R for example) may emerge from the compactification process, a high-quality accidental axion (accion) can emerge from the accidental, approximate remnant global U(1)_{PQ} symmetry where the decay constant f_a is linked to the SUSY breaking scale, and is within the cosmological sweet zone.</description>

We present a new method to simultaneously/self-consistently model the mass distribution of galaxy clusters that combines constraints from strong lensing features, X-ray emission and galaxy kinematics measurements. We are able to successfully decompose clusters into their collisionless and collisional mass components thanks to the X-ray surface brightness, as well as using the dynamics of cluster members to obtain more accurate masses with the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies.</description>

Bimetric gravity is an interesting alternative to standard GR given its potential to provide a concrete theoretical framework for a ghost-free massive gravity theory. Here we investigate a class of Bimetric gravity models for their cosmological implications. We study the background expansion as well as the growth of matter perturbations at linear and second order. We use low-redshift observations from SnIa (Pantheon+ and SH0ES), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), the growth ($f\sigma_{8}$) measurements and the measurement from Megamaser Cosmology Project to constrain the Bimetric model.</description>

We characterize the peculiar velocity field of the local large-scale structure reconstructed from the $2M++$ survey, by treating it as a fluid, extracting the gradient and the divergence via different approximations. This reconstructed field is important for cosmology, since it was used to correct the peculiar redshifts of the last SNIA compilation Pantheon+. We conclude that the local velocity field can be described on average as a slightly contracting fluid, with intriguing implications for the ``Tilted Cosmology&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; model.</description>

Tension between cosmic microwave background-based and distance ladder-based determinations of the Hubble constant H0 motivates pursuit of independent methods that are not subject to the same systematic effects. A promising alternative, proposed by Refsdal in 1964, relies on the inverse scaling of H0 with the delay between the arrival times of at least two images of a strongly-lensed variable source such as a quasar. To date, Refsdal&amp;rsquo;s method has mostly been applied to quasars lensed by individual galaxies rather than by galaxy clusters.</description>

We present new observations of sixteen bright ($r=19-21$) gravitationally lensed galaxies at $z\simeq 1-3$ selected from the CASSOWARY survey. Included in our sample is the $z=1.42$ galaxy CSWA-141, one of the brightest known reionization-era analogs at high redshift (g=20.5), with a large sSFR (31.2 Gyr$^{-1}$) and an $[OIII]$+H$\beta$ equivalent width (EW${\rm{$[OIII]$+H\beta}}$=730~\r{A}) that is nearly identical to the average value expected at $z\simeq 7-8$. In this paper, we investigate the rest-frame UV nebular line emission in our sample with the goal of understanding the factors that regulate strong CIII]$ emission.</description>

X-ray observations of galaxy clusters are impacted by the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a manner that is challenging to quantify, leading to biases in the detection and measurement of cluster properties for both astrophysics and cosmological applications. Using automated X-ray pipeline techniques, we introduce a new automated class for AGN-contaminated (AC) clusters in the XXL source detection software. The majority of these systems are otherwise missed by current X-ray cluster detection methods.</description>

We present new {\em Hubble Space Telescope} WFC3/IR medium-band photometry of the compact elliptical galaxy M32, chemically resolving its thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars. We find 2829 M-type stars and 57 C stars. The carbon stars are likely contaminants from M31. If carbon stars are present in M32 they are so in very low numbers. The uncorrected C/M ratio is 0.020 $\pm$ 0.003; this drops to less than 0.</description>

Supernova (SN) explosions have been sought for decades as a possible source of dust in the Universe, providing the seeds of galaxies, stars, and planetary systems. SN 1987A offers one of the most promising examples of significant SN dust formation, but until the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), instruments have traditionally lacked the sensitivity at both late times (&amp;gt;1 yr post-explosion) and longer wavelengths (i.e., &amp;gt;10 um) to detect analogous dust reservoirs.</description>

The F115W vs. F115W-F322W2 CMD from NIRCam shows that, below the knee, the MS stars span a wide color range, where the majority of M-dwarfs exhibit blue colors, and a tail of stars are distributed toward the red.</description>

We study the link between gas flow events and key galaxy scaling relations: the relations between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (the main sequence, MS), gas metallicity and stellar mass (the mass-metallicity relation, MZR) and gas metallicity, stellar mass and SFR (the fundamental metallicity relation, FMR). Using all star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the 22 MUSE fields of the MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) survey, we derive the MS, MZR and FMR scaling relations for 385 SFGs with $M = 10^8 - 10^{11.</description>

Early-time light curves/spectra of some hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) give firm evidence on the existence of confined, dense circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding dying massive stars. We numerically and analytically study radiative acceleration of CSM in such systems, where the radiation is mainly powered by the interaction between the SN ejecta and the CSM. We find that the acceleration of the ambient CSM is larger for massive and compact CSM, with velocities reaching up to $\sim 10^3\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$ for a CSM of order $0.</description>

One of the greatest uncertainties in any modeling of inner engine of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is neutrino flavor conversions driven by neutrino self-interactions. We carry out large-scale numerical simulations of multi-energy, multi-angle, three-flavor framework, and general relativistic quantum kinetic neutrino transport in spherical symmetry with an essential set of neutrino-matter interactions under a realistic fluid profile of CCSN. Our result suggests that the neutrino heating in the gain region is reduced by $\sim 50%$ due to fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC).</description>

For the past decade, SALT2 has been the most common model used to fit Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves for dark energy analyses. Recently, the SALT3 model was released, which upgraded a number of model features but has not yet been used for measurements of dark energy. Here, we evaluate the impact of switching from SALT2 to SALT3 for a SN cosmology analysis. We train SALT2 and SALT3 on an identical training sample of 1083 well-calibrated Type Ia supernovae, ensuring that any differences found come from the underlying model framework.</description>

The SFHs of early-type dwarf galaxies are characterized by pre-enriched, metal-poor old stellar populations, absence of moderately old stars that have ages of a few Gyr. There are some differences in the SFHs of dSphs and dEs. In particular, dSphs formed old ($\gtrsim10$ Gyr old) metal-poor stars $\sim2$ times more than dEs.</description>

The Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension is one of the major open problems in modern cosmology. This tension is the discrepancy, ranging from 4 to 6 $\sigma$, between the $H_0$ value estimated locally with the combination of Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) + Cepheids and the cosmological $H_0$ obtained through the study of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. The approaches adopted in Dainotti et al. 2021 (ApJ) and Dainotti et al.</description>

      <description>First author: Francesca Pinna
Recent integral-field spectroscopy observations have revealed that thick- and thin-disk star-formation histories are regulated by the interplay of internal and external processes. We analyze stellar-population properties of 24 spiral galaxies from the AURIGA zoom-in cosmological simulations, to offer a more in-depth interpretation of observable properties. We present edge-on maps of stellar age, metallicity and $[Mg/Fe]$ abundance, and we extract the star-formation and chemical-evolution histories of thin and thick disks.</description>

We present extensive optical photometry of the afterglow of GRB 221009A. Our data cover $0.9 - 59.9$ days from the time of Swift and Fermi GRB detections. Photometry in $rizy$-band filters was collected primarily with Pan-STARRS and supplemented by multiple 1- to 4-meter imaging facilities. We analyzed the Swift X-ray data of the afterglow and found a single decline rate power-law $f(t) \propto t^{-1.556\pm0.002}$ best describes the light curve.</description>

Abundance matching studies have shown that the average relationship between galaxy radius and dark matter halo virial radius remains nearly constant over many orders of magnitude in halo mass, and over cosmic time since about $z=3$. In this work, we investigate the predicted relationship between galaxy radius $r_{e}$ and halo virial radius $R_{\rm h}$ in the numerical hydrodynamical simulations Illustris and IllustrisTNG from $z\sim 0$&amp;ndash;3, and compare with the results from the abundance matching studies.</description>

The dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies holds a wealth of information on the fundamental properties and interactions of the dark matter particle. In this paper, we study whether ultralight bosonic dark matter is consistent with the gravitational potential extracted from stellar kinematics. We use velocity dispersion measurements to constrain models for halo mass and particle mass. The posterior likelihood is multimodal. Particle masses of order $m\sim 10^{-22} {\rm{eV}}$ require halos of mass in excess of $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$, while particle mass of order $m \gtrsim 10^{-20}{\rm{eV}}$ are favored by halos of mass $\sim [10^{8} - 10^{9}] M_\odot$, with a similar behavior to cold dark matter.</description>

Dirac, in 1937 proposed the variation of coupling constants derived from his large number hypothesis. Efforts have continued since then to constrain their variation by various methods. We briefly discuss several methods used for the purpose while focusing primarily on the use of supernovae type 1a, quasars, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as cosmological probes for determining cosmological distances. Supernovae type Ia (SNeIa) are considered the best standard candles since their intrinsic luminosity can be determined precisely from their light curves.</description>

On large cosmological scales, anisotropic gravitational collapse is manifest in the dark cosmic web. Its statistical properties are well known for the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, yet become modified for alternative dark matter models such as fuzzy dark matter (FDM). In this work, we assess for the first time the relative importance of cosmic nodes, filaments, walls and voids in a cosmology with small-scale suppression of power such as FDM.</description>

      <description>First author: Philip Mocz
We investigate cosmological structure formation in Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) with an attractive self-interaction (SI) with numerical simulations. Such a SI would arise if the FDM boson were an ultra-light axion, which has a strong CP symmetry-breaking scale (decay constant). Although weak, the attractive SI may be strong enough to counteract the quantum &amp;lsquo;pressure&amp;rsquo; and alter structure formation. We find in our simulations that the SI can enhance small-scale structure formation, and soliton cores above a critical mass undergo a phase transition, transforming from dilute to dense solitons.</description>

We investigate the first emergence of the so-called cold accretion, the accretion flows deeply penetrating a halo, in the early universe with cosmological N-body/SPH simulations. We study the structure of the accretion flow and its evolution within small halos with $\lesssim 10^8~{\rm M}_\odot$ with sufficiently high spatial resolutions down to $\sim 1 \ {\rm pc}$ scale. While previous studies only follow the evolution for a short period after the primordial cloud collapse, we follow the long-term evolution until the cold accretion first appears, employing the sink particle method.</description>

The metallicity distributions of globular cluster (GC) systems in galaxies are a critical test of any GC formation scenario. In this work, we investigate the predicted GC metallicity distributions of galaxies in the MOdelling Star cluster population Assembly In Cosmological Simulations within EAGLE (E-MOSAICS) simulation of a representative cosmological volume ($L = 34.4$ comoving Mpc). We find that the predicted GC metallicity distributions and median metallicities from the fiducial E-MOSAICS GC formation model agree well the observed distributions, except for galaxies with masses $M_\ast \sim 2 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, which contain an overabundance of metal-rich GCs.</description>

GeV and TeV emission from the forward shocks of supernova remnants (SNRs) indicates that they are capable particle accelerators, making them promising sources of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs). However, it remains uncertain whether this $\gamma$-ray emission arises primarily from the decay of neutral pions produced by very high energy hadrons, or from inverse-Compton and/or bremsstrahlung emission from relativistic leptons. By applying a semi-analytic approach to non-linear diffusive shock acceleration (NLDSA) and calculating the particle and photon spectra produced in different astrophysical environments, we parametrize the relative strength of hadronic and leptonic emission.</description>

The next Galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) will be a unique opportunity to study within a fully multi-messenger approach the explosion mechanism responsible for the formation of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes. State-of-the-art numerical simulations of those events reveal the complexity of the gravitational-wave emission which is highly stochastic. This challenges the possibility to infer the properties of the compact remnant and of its progenitor using the information encoded in the waveforms.</description>

We present the star formation histories (SFHs) of early-type dwarf galaxies, dSphs and dEs, in the local universe within z=0.01. The SFHs of early-type dwarf galaxies are characterized by pre-enriched, metal-poor old stellar populations, absence of moderately old stars that have ages of a few Gyr. There are some differences in the SFHs of dSphs and dEs. In particular, dSphs formed old ($\gtrsim10$ Gyr old) metal-poor stars $\sim2$ times more than dEs.</description>

The nature of dark matter (DM) is an open question in cosmology, despite its abundance in the universe. While elementary particles have been posited to explain DM, compact astrophysical objects such as black holes formed in the early universe offer a theoretically appealing alternate route. Here, we constrain the fraction of DM that can be made up of primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M \gtrsim 0.</description>

We present a new method to predict the line-of-sight column density (NH) values of active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on mid-infrared (MIR), soft, and hard X-ray data. We developed a multiple linear regression machine learning algorithm trained with WISE colors, Swift-BAT count rates, soft X-ray hardness ratios, and an MIR-soft X-ray flux ratio. Our algorithm was trained off 451 AGN from the Swift-BAT sample with known NH and has the ability to accurately predict NH values for AGN of all levels of obscuration, as evidenced by its Spearman correlation coefficient value of 0.</description>

We confirm emission line redshifts for 7 galaxies at $z=7.762-8.998$ using spectra at $\sim1-5\mu$m either with the NIRSpec prism or its three medium resolution gratings. For $z\simeq9$ photometric candidates, we achieve a high confirmation rate of $\simeq$90%, which validates the classical dropout selection from NIRCam photometry.</description>

Upcoming deep galaxy surveys with JWST will probe galaxy evolution during the epoch of reionisation (EoR, $5\leq z\leq10$) over relatively compact areas (e.g. $\sim$ 300,arcmin$^2$ for the JADES GTO survey). It is therefore imperative that we understand the degree of survey variance, to evaluate how representative the galaxy populations in these studies will be. We use the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) to measure the galaxy bias of various tracers over an unprecedentedly large range in overdensity for a hydrodynamic simulation, and use these relations to assess the impact of bias and clustering on survey variance in the EoR.</description>

Contamination from galaxy fragments, identified as sources, is a major issue in large photometric galaxy catalogs. In this paper, we prove that this problem can be easily addressed with computer vision techniques. We use image cutouts to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify catalogued sources that are in reality just star formation regions and/or shreds of larger galaxies. The CNN reaches an accuracy ~98% on our testing datasets.</description>

      <description>First author: Patrick S. Kamieneski
The PASSAGES ($Planck$ All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts) collaboration has recently defined a sample of 30 gravitationally-lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). These rare, submillimeter-selected objects enable high-resolution views of the most extreme sites of star formation in galaxies at Cosmic Noon. Here, we present the first major compilation of strong lensing analyses using LENSTOOL for PASSAGES, including 15 objects spanning $z=1.1-3.3$, using complementary information from $0.</description>

      <description>First author: Florian List
Large-scale cosmological simulations are an indispensable tool for modern cosmology. To enable model-space exploration, fast and accurate predictions are critical. In this paper, we show that the performance of such simulations can be further improved with time-stepping schemes that use input from cosmological perturbation theory. Specifically, we introduce a class of time-stepping schemes derived by matching the particle trajectories in a single leapfrog/Verlet drift-kick-drift step to those predicted by Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT).</description>

      <description>First author: Haojing Yan
The recent searches for z&amp;gt;11 galaxies using the James Webb Space Telescope have resulted in an unexpectedly high number of candidate objects, which imply at least an order of magnitude higher number density of $z&amp;gt;11$ galaxies than the previously favored predictions. A question has risen whether there are some new types of contaminants among these candidates. The candidate sample of Yan et al. (2023a), totalling 87 dropouts, is the largest one, and we notice that a number of these candidates are point-like.</description>

      <description>First author: Paolo Saracco
We derived stellar ages and metallicities $[Z/H]$ for $\sim$70 passive early type galaxies (ETGs) selected from VANDELS survey over the redshift range 1.0$&amp;lt;$$z$$&amp;lt;$1.4 and stellar mass range 10$&amp;lt;$log(M$*$/M$\odot$)$&amp;lt;$11.6. We find significant systematics in their estimates depending on models and wavelength ranges considered. Using the full-spectrum fitting technique, we find that both $[Z/H]$ and age increase with mass as for local ETGs. Age and metallicity sensitive spectral indices independently confirm these trends.</description>

We trace the evolution of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 3501, making use of its stellar populations extracted from deep integral-field spectroscopy MUSE observations. We present stellar kinematic and population maps, as well as the star formation history, of the south-western half of the galaxy. The derived maps of the stellar line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion are quite regular, show disc-like rotation, and no other structural component of the galaxy.</description>

In this work we test Wasserstein distance in conjunction with persistent homology, as a tool for discriminating large scale structures of simulated universes with different values of $\sigma_8$ cosmological parameter (present root-mean-square matter fluctuation averaged over a sphere of radius 8 Mpc comoving). The Wasserstein distance (a.k.a. the pair-matching distance) was proposed to measure the difference between two networks in terms of persistent homology. The advantage of this approach consists in its non-parametric way of probing the topology of the Cosmic web, in contrast to graph-theoretical approach depending on linking length.</description>

(Abridged) Galaxy clusters are a powerful probe of cosmological models. Next generation large-scale optical and infrared surveys will reach unprecedented depths over large areas and require highly complete and pure cluster catalogs, with a well defined selection function. We have developed a new cluster detection algorithm YOLO-CL, which is a modified version of the state-of-the-art object detection deep convolutional network YOLO, optimized for the detection of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <description>First author: Luc Dessart
Much excitement surrounds the intense mass loss that seems to take place in some massive stars immediately before core collapse. However, occurring too late, it has a negligible impact on the star&amp;rsquo;s evolution or the final yields, which are influenced instead by the longer-term, quasi-steady mass loss taking place during H and He burning. Late-time observations of core-collapse supernovae interacting with the progenitor wind are one means to constrain this secular mass loss.</description>

Protoclusters of galaxies have been found in the last quarter century. However, most of them have been found through the overdensity of star-forming galaxies, and there had been no known structures identified by multiple spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies at $z&amp;gt;2.5$. In this letter, we report the discovery of an overdense structure of massive quiescent galaxies with the spectroscopic redshift $z=2.77$ in the COSMOS field, QO-1000. We first photometrically identify this structure as a $4.</description>

      <description>First author: Johannes U. Lange
We present a novel simulation-based cosmological analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy redshift-space clustering. Compared to analysis methods based on perturbation theory, our simulation-based approach allows us to probe a much wider range of scales, $0.4 , h^{-1} , \mathrm{Mpc}$ to $63 , h^{-1} , \mathrm{Mpc}$, including highly non-linear scales, and marginalises over astrophysical effects such as assembly bias. We apply this framework to data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey LOWZ sample cross-correlated with state-of-the-art gravitational lensing catalogues from the Kilo Degree Survey and the Dark Energy Survey.</description>

We have studied the system of globular clusters (GCs) that formed in other galaxies and eventually accreted onto the Milky Way. Thus, the samples of GCs belonging to different tidal streams, obtained on the basis of the latest data from the Gaia observatory, were taken from the literature. We measured the anisotropy of the distribution of these GCs using the gyration tensor and found that the distribution of GCs in the streams is isotropic.</description>

      <description>Sven Martens
The formation process of multiple populations in globular clusters is still up for debate. Kinematic differences between the populations are particularly interesting in this respect, because they allow us to distinguish between single-epoch formation scenarios and multi-epoch formation scenarios. We analyze the kinematics of 25 globular clusters and aim to find kinematic differences between multiple populations to constrain their formation process. We split red-giant branch (RGB) stars in each cluster into three populations (P1, P2, P3) for the type-II clusters and two populations (P1 and P2) otherwise using Hubble photometry.</description>

By using direct N-body numerical simulations, we model the dynamical co-evolution of two supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the surrounding stars in merging galaxies. In order to investigate how different stellar components evolve during the merger, we generate evolved stellar distributions with an initial mass function. Special schemes have also been developed to deal with some rare but interesting events, such as tidal disruption of main sequence stars, the plunge of low mass stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars and stellar mass black holes, and the partial tidal disruption of red giants or asymptotic giant branch stars.</description>

We use the measured scattering timescales of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) from the CHIME catalog to derive an upper limit on the magnetic field on sub-kpc scales in the intergalactic medium (IGM). A nonmagnetized, photoionized IGM is insufficient to explain the turbulent scattering at all redshifts, with a Warm-Hot component being marginally consistent with the data at $z \sim 1$. Accounting for the lower envelope of the temporal smearing distribution with a nonzero magnetic field leads to upper limits $B &amp;lt; 10$ nG on scales of 0.</description>

Based on a comparison of the SRG/eROSITA catalog of X-ray active stars and the Gaia catalog, a sample of 502 peculiar objects was obtained for which Gaia, on one hand, detects statistically significant values of parallax or proper motion and, on the other hand, registers signs of the non zero source extent in the optical band. In the log ($F_X/F_{\rm opt}$) - (G-RP) color diagram these objects are separated from the balk of X-ray active stars and are located in the region typical for the galaxies with active nuclei.</description>

The existence of globular clusters (GCs) in a few satellite galaxies, and their absence in majority of dwarf galaxies, present a challenge for models attempting to understand the origins of GCs. In addition to GC presence appearing stochastic and difficult to describe with average trends, in the smallest satellite galaxies GCs contribute a substantial fraction of total stellar mass. We investigate the stochasticity and number of GCs in dwarf galaxies using an updated version of our model that links the formation of GCs to the growth of the host galaxy mass.</description>

      <description>Andrea Incatasciato
The Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation field is a key ingredient in the chemo-thermal evolution of gas in the Early Universe, as it dissociates H2 molecules, the primary cooling channel in an environment devoid of metals and dust. Despite its important role, it is still not implemented in cosmological simulations on a regular basis, in contrast to the general UV background. This is in part due to uncertainty in the source modelling, their spectra and abundance, as well as the detailed physics involved in the propagation of the photons and their interactions with the molecules.</description>

The problem of the spatial motion of a passively gravitating body (PGB) in the gravitational field of a layered inhomogeneous elliptical galaxy (LIEG) is considered on the basis of the previously developed model. It is assumed that a LIEG consists of baryonic mass (BM) and dark matter (DM), which have different laws of density distribution. A star or the center of mass of a globular cluster is taken as the PGB, the motion of which considers the BM and DM attraction.</description>

In this work we present extremely high resolution simulations of spiral galaxies with time-dependent chemistry such that we can track the formation of the CNM, its distribution within the galaxy, and its correlation with star formation.</description>

      <description>First author: M. Pursiainen
We present linear polarimetry for seven hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). For SN 2017gci, for which we present two epochs of spectropolarimetry at +3 d and +29 d post-peak in rest frame, accompanied by four epochs of imaging polarimetry up to +108 d. The spectropolarimetry at +3 d shows increasing polarisation degree P towards the redder wavelengths and exhibits signs of axial symmetry, but at +29 d P=0 throughout the spectrum implying that the photosphere of SN 2017gci evolved from a slightly aspherical configuration to a more spherical one in the first month post-peak.</description>

      <description>First author: Y. Schnellbach
The supernova model discrimination capabilities of the WATCHMAN detector concept are explored. This cylindrical kilotonne-scale water Cherenkov detector design has been developed to detect reactor antineutrinos through inverse $\beta$-decay for non-proliferation applications but also has the ability to observe antineutrino bursts of core-collapse supernovae within our galaxy. Detector configurations with sizes ranging from 16 m to 22 m tank diameter and 10% to 20% PMT coverage are used to compare the expected observable antineutrino spectra based on the Nakazato, Vartanyan and Warren supernova models.</description>

The Fornax galaxy cluster is an ideal nearby laboratory in which to study the impact of dense environments on the evolution of galaxies. The Fornax3D survey offers extended and deep integral-field spectroscopic observations for the brightest 33 galaxies within of virial radius of the Fornax cluster, obtained with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph, mounted on Unit Telescope 4 (Yepun) of ESO&amp;rsquo;s Very Large Telescope in Chile. The Fornax3D data allowed us to reconstruct the formation of early-type galaxies in the cluster and to explore the link with spiral galaxies.</description>

      <description>First author: S. A. Gasanov
To solve some problems of celestial mechanics and astrophysics, three new models of an elliptical galaxy (EG) have been created, which are in good agreement with modern understanding of the structure of such galaxies. Based on these models, the total gravitational (potential) energy and rotational kinetic energy of an EG, as well as the velocity dispersion at a distance of its effective radius, are determined.</description>

      <description>First author: Keir K. Rogers
We search for ultra-light axions as dark matter (DM) and dark energy particle candidates, for axion masses $10^{-32},\mathrm{eV} \leq m_\mathrm{a} \leq 10^{-24},\mathrm{eV}$, by a joint analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy clustering data &amp;ndash; and consider if axions can resolve the tension in inferred values of the matter clustering parameter $S_8$. We give legacy constraints from Planck 2018 CMB data, improving 2015 limits on the axion density $\Omega_\mathrm{a} h^2$ by up to a factor of three; CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope marginally weaken Planck bounds at $m_\mathrm{a} = 10^{-25},\mathrm{eV}$, owing to lower (and theoretically-consistent) gravitational lensing signals.</description>

      <description>First author: Marco Gullieuszik
Star-forming, H$\alpha$-emitting clumps are found embedded in the gaseous tails of galaxies undergoing intense ram-pressure stripping in galaxy clusters, so-called jellyfish galaxies. These clumps offer a unique opportunity to study star formation under extreme conditions, in the absence of an underlying disk and embedded within the hot intracluster medium. Yet, a comprehensive, high spatial resolution study of these systems is missing. We obtained UVIS/HST data to observe the first statistical sample of clumps in the tails and disks of six jellyfish galaxies from the GASP survey; we used a combination of broad-band filters and a narrow-band H{\alpha} filter.</description>

The powerful high-redshift quasar J2102+6015 (at z=4.575) may provide useful information for studying supermassive black hole growth, galaxy evolution and feedback in the early Universe. The source has so far been imaged with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) at 2/8 GHz (S/X) bands only, showing complex compact structure. Its total radio spectrum peaks at ~6 GHz in the rest frame. There is no sign of Doppler-boosted jet emission, and the separation of the two major features in its east-west oriented structure spanning ~10 milliarcsec does not change significantly on a timescale longer than a decade.</description>

      <description>First author: Ahmad Mehrabi
A model-independent or non-parametric approach for modeling a database has been widely used in cosmology. In these scenarios, the data has been used directly to reconstruct an underlying function. In this work, we introduce a novel semi-model-independent method to do the task. The new approach not only removes some drawbacks of previous methods but also has some remarkable advantages. We combine the well-known Gaussian linear model with a neural network and introduce a procedure for the reconstruction of an arbitrary function.</description>

The information on Galactic assembly time is imprinted on the chemodynamics of globular clusters. This makes them important probes that help us to understand the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Discerning between in-situ and ex-situ origin of these objects is difficult when we study the Galactic bulge, which is the most complex and mixed component of the Milky Way. To investigate the early evolution of the Galactic bulge, we analysed the globular cluster NGC 6355.</description>

      <description>First author: T. Tuominen
The current observational status of the hot (log T(K) &amp;gt; 5.5) warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) remains incomplete. While recent observations from stacking large numbers of Cosmic Web filaments have yielded statistically significant detections, direct measurements of single objects remain scarce. The lack of such a sample currently prevents a robust analysis of the cosmic baryon content composed of the hot WHIM, which could help solve the cosmological missing baryons problem.</description>

      <description>First author: M. Arabsalmani
We study the relation between the metallicities of ionised and neutral gas in star-forming galaxies at z=1-3 using the EAGLE cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. This is done by constructing a dense grid of sightlines through the simulated galaxies and obtaining the star formation rate- and HI column density-weighted metallicities, Z_{SFR} and Z_{HI}, for each sightline as proxies for the metallicities of ionised and neutral gas, respectively. We find Z_{SFR} &amp;gt; Z_{HI} for almost all sightlines, with their difference generally increasing with decreasing metallicity.</description>

      <description>First author: Alejandro Aviles
The next generation of galaxy surveys will provide highly accurate measurements of the large-scale structure of the Universe, allowing for more stringent tests of gravity on cosmological scales. Higher order statistics are a valuable tool to study the non-Gaussianities in the matter field and to break degeneracies between modified gravity and other physical or nuisance parameters. However, understanding from first principles the behaviour of these correlations is essential to characterise deviations from General Relativity (GR), and the purpose of this work.</description>

We used fluxes of the optical narrow emission line intensities $3,500&amp;lt;\lambda($\AA$)&amp;lt;7,000$ of 561 Seyfert nuclei in the local universe ($z\lesssim0.31$) from the second catalog and data release (DR2) of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey, which focuses on the \textit{Swift}-BAT hard X-ray ($\gtrsim10$ keV) detected AGNs.</description>

      <description>First author: Seiji Kameno
The radio galaxy NGC 1052 casts absorption features of sulfur-bearing molecules, H$_2$S, SO, SO$_2$, and CS toward the radio continuum emission from the core and jets. Using ALMA, we have measured the equivalent widths of SO absorption features in multiple transitions and determined the temperatures of $344 \pm 43$ K and $26 \pm 4$ K in sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths, respectively. Since sub-mm and mm continuum represents the core and jets, the high and low temperatures of the absorbers imply warm environment in the molecular torus and cooler downstream flows.</description>

Long-term observations of synchrotron emission from supernovae (SNe), covering more than a year after the explosion, provide a unique opportunity to study the poorly-understood evolution of massive stars in the final millennium of their lives via changes in the mass-loss rate. Here, we present a result of our long-term monitoring of a peculiar type IIL SN 2018ivc, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Following the initial decay, it showed unprecedented rebrightening starting at ~ a year after the explosion.</description>

Strong gravitational lensing and microlensing of supernovae (SNe) are emerging as a new probe of cosmology and astrophysics in recent years. We provide an overview of this nascent research field, starting with a summary of the first discoveries of strongly lensed SNe. We describe the use of the time delays between multiple SN images as a way to measure cosmological distances and thus constrain cosmological parameters, particularly the Hubble constant, whose value is currently under heated debates.</description>

We observe at least once 88 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), 12 tidal disruption events (TDEs) and 203 other transients, including supernovae (SNe). We stack our ACT observations to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the maps.</description>

Milky Way-mass galaxies in the FIRE-2 simulations demonstrate two main modes of star formation. At high redshifts star formation occurs in a series of short and intense bursts, while at low redshifts star formation proceeds at a steady rate with a transition from one mode to another at times ranging from 3 to 7 Gyr ago for different galaxies. We analyse how the mode of star formation affects iron and alpha-element abundance.</description>

We present measurements of $[NeIII]$ λ3869 emission in z~1 low-mass galaxies taken from the Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic surveys HALO7D and DEEPWinds. We identify 167 individual galaxies with significant $[NeIII]$ emission lines, including 112 &amp;amp;#34;dwarf&amp;amp;#34; galaxies with log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &amp;amp;lt; 9.5, with 0.3 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 1.4. We also measure $[NeIII]$ emission from composite spectra derived from all $[OII]$λλ3727,3729 line emitters in this range. This provides a unique sample of $[NeIII]$-emitters in the gap between well-studied emitters at z = 0 and 2 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 3.</description>

Our sample includes quasars and narrow-line Seyfert 1s: thus our AGN span a wide range in luminosity, black hole mass and accretion rate.</description>

Spectroscopic studies of extreme-ionization galaxies (EIGs) are critical to our understanding of exotic systems throughout cosmic time. These EIGs exhibit spectral features requiring &amp;gt;54.42 eV photons: the energy needed to fully ionize helium into He2+ and emit He II recombination lines. They are likely key contributors to reionization, and they can also probe exotic stellar populations or accretion onto massive black holes. To facilitate the use of EIGs as probes of high ionization, we focus on ratios constructed from strong rest-frame UV/optical emission lines, specifically $[O III]$ 5008, H-beta, $[Ne III]$ 3870, $[O II]$ 3727,3729, and $[Ne V]$ 3427.</description>

To do this, we combine theoretical models of PAH emission features as they respond to varying interstellar radiation fields, grain size distributions, and ionization states with a new on-the-fly model for dust evolution in hydrodynamic galaxy simulations. We apply these models to 3 idealized arepo galaxy evolution simulations within the smuggle physics framework.</description>

We have recently suggested that the combination of the scalar virial theorem ($M_s \sim R_e \sigma^2$) and the $L=L&amp;rsquo;_0 \sigma^\beta(t)$ law, with L&amp;rsquo;_0 and $\beta$ changing from galaxy to galaxy (and with time), can provide a new set of equations valid for investigating the evolution of early-type galaxies (ETGs) (Donofrio &amp;amp; Chiosi, 2022). These equations are able to account for the tilt of the Fundamental Plane (FP) and to explain the observed distributions of ETGs in all its projections.</description>

      <description>First author: Sandra I. Raimundo
External accretion events such as a galaxy merger or the accretion of gas from the immediate environment of a galaxy, can create a large misalignment between the gas and the stellar kinematics. Numerical simulations have suggested that misaligned structures may promote the inflow of gas to the nucleus of the galaxy and the accretion of gas by the central supermassive black hole. We show for the first time that galaxies with a strong misalignment between the ionised gas and stellar kinematic angles have a higher observed fraction of active black holes than galaxies with aligned rotation of gas and stars.</description>

      <description>First author: Matthew C. Smith
Arkenstone is a new model for multiphase, stellar feedback driven galactic winds designed for inclusion in coarse resolution cosmological simulations. In this first paper of a series, we describe the features that allow Arkenstone to properly treat high specific energy wind components and demonstrate them using idealised non-cosmological simulations of a galaxy with a realistic CGM, using the Arepo code. Hot, fast gas phases with low mass loadings are predicted to dominate the energy content of multiphase outflows.</description>

The ultra-luminous infrared galaxy Arp2 20 is a late-stage merger with several tidal structures in the outskirts and two very compact, dusty nuclei that show evidence for extreme star formation and host at least one AGN. New and archival high-resolution images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope provide a state-of-the-art view of the structures, dust, and stellar clusters in Arp 220. We find that ~90% of the Halpha emission arises from a shock-ionized bubble emanating from the AGN in the western nucleus, while the nuclear disks dominate the Pbeta emission.</description>

The flattened, possibly co-rotating plane of satellite galaxies around Centaurus A, if more than a fortuitous alignment, adds to the pre-existing tension between the well-studied Milky Way and M31 planes and the $Λ$CDM model of structure formation. It was recently reported that the Centaurus A satellite plane (CASP) may be rotationally supported, but a further understanding of the system&amp;amp;#39;s kinematics is elusive in the absence of full three-dimensional velocities.</description>

At least one dimensionless physical constant (i.e., a physically observable) must change for the cosmic time to make the varying speed of light (VSL) models phenomenologically feasible. Various physical constants and quantities also should be functions of cosmic time to satisfy all known local laws of physics, including special relativity, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. Adiabaticity is another necessary condition to keep the homogeneity and isotropy of three-dimensional space [1].</description>

We present chemical abundances and velocities of five stars between 0.3 kpc to 1.1 kpc from the center of the Tucana II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) from high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy. We find that every star is deficient in metals (-3.6 &amp;amp;lt; $[Fe/H]$ &amp;amp;lt; -1.9) and in neutron-capture elements as is characteristic of UFD stars, unambiguously confirming their association with Tucana II. Other chemical abundances (e.g., C, iron-peak) largely follow UFD trends and suggest that faint core-collapse supernovae (SNe) dominated the early evolution of Tucana II.</description>

We present a dynamical analysis of a quasar-host galaxy at $z\simeq 6$ (SDSS J2310+1855) using a high-resolution ALMA observation of the $[CII]$ emission line. The observed rotation curve was fitted with mass models that considered the gravitational contribution of a thick gas disc, a thick star-forming stellar disc, and a central mass concentration, which is likely due to a combination of a spheroidal component (i.e. a stellar bulge) and a supermassive black hole (SMBH).</description>

The abundance of carbon relative to oxygen (C/O) is a promising probe of star formation history in the early universe, as these elements are produced on different timescales. We present a measurement of $\log{\mathrm{(C/O)}} = -1.01\pm0.12$ (stat) $\pm0.10$ (sys) in a $z=6.23$ galaxy observed as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program. Notably, we achieve good precision thanks to the detection of the rest-frame ultraviolet O III], C III], and C IV emission lines delivered by JWST/NIRSpec.</description>

Our results represent the first statistical constraints on the evolution of the $[OIII]$/H$\beta$ vs. $[NII]$/H$\alpha$, $[SII]$/H$\alpha$, and $[OI]$/H$\alpha$ ``BPT&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; diagrams at $z&amp;gt;2.7$, and the first analysis of the O32 vs. R23 diagram at $z&amp;gt;4$ with a large sample.</description>

This paper is dedicated to assessing modified cosmological settings based on the gravitational Standard-Model Extension (SME). Our analysis rests upon the Hubble tension (HT), which is a discrepancy between the observational determination of the Hubble parameter via data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae, respectively. While the latter approach is model-independent, the former highly depends on the model used to describe the physics of the early Universe.</description>

We analyze all available X-ray data from \chandra, \xmm, and \nustar, adding up to a total of 53 individual observations. This corresponds to between 3 and 7 observations per source, probing variability timescales between a few days and $\sim 20$~yr.</description>

Gravitational waves (GWs) from the compact binary coalescences can be used as standard sirens to explore the cosmic expansion history. In the next decades, it is anticipated that we could obtain the multi-band GW standard siren data (from nanohertz to a few hundred hertz), which are expected to play an important role in cosmological parameter estimation. In this work, we give for the first time the joint constraints on cosmological parameters using the future multi-band GW standard siren observations.</description>

We describe new JWST/NIRSpec observations of galaxies at $z\gtrsim7$ taken as part of the CEERS survey of the EGS field. Previous observations of this area have revealed associations of Ly$\alpha$ emitters at redshifts ($z=7.5$, $7.7$, $8.7$) where the IGM is thought mostly neutral, leading to suggestions that these systems are situated in large ionized bubbles. We identify 21 $z\gtrsim7$ galaxies with robust redshifts in the CEERS dataset, including 10 in the Ly$\alpha$ associations.</description>

To explore possible close encounters (or collisions) between the GCs, using our own developed high-order phi-GRAPE code, we integrated backward and forward the orbits of 119 objects with reliable positions and proper motions. In calculations, we adopted a realistic axisymmetric Galactic potential (bulge + disk + halo).</description>

One of the primary goals when studying galaxy formation is to understand how the luminous component of the Universe, galaxies, relates to the growth of structure which is dominated by the gravitational collapse of dark matter haloes. The stellar-to-halo mass relation probes how galaxies occupy dark matter haloes and what that entails for their star formation history. We deliver the first self-consistent empirical model that can place constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation down to log stellar mass $\log_{10}(m^/\mathrm{M}{\odot}) \leq 5.</description>

The standard model of cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) is facing a serious crisis caused by the inconsistencies in the measurements of some fundamental cosmological parameters (Hubble constant $H_{0}$ and cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_{k}$ for example). On the other hand a strictly linear evolution of the cosmological scale factor is found to be an excellent fit to a host of observations. Any model that can support such a coasting presents itself as a falsifiable model as far as the cosmological tests are concerned.</description>

      <description>First author: Benjamin Metha
Massive stars are thought to be progenitors of Long Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), most likely with a bias favouring low metallicity progenitors. Because galaxies do not have a constant metallicity throughout, the combination of line-of-sight absorption metallicity inferred from GRB afterglow spectroscopy and of host galaxy global metallicity derived from emission lines diagnostics represents a powerful way to probe both the bias function for GRB progenitors, and the chemical inhomogeneities across star forming regions.</description>

Photometric quality metrics from DOLPHOT in one or two filters can recover a pure sample of stars. Conversely, colors formed between short-wavelength (SW) and long-wavelength (LW) filters can be used to effectively identify pure samples of galaxies.</description>

      <description>First author: Rui-Chong Hu
Extreme stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe), including Type Ic superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), broad-line Type Ic SNe (SNe Ic-BL), and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), are widely believed to harbor a newborn fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron star (``magnetar&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;), which can lose its rotational energy via spin-down processes to accelerate and heat the ejecta. The progenitor(s) of these magnetar-driven SESNe, and the origin of considerable angular momentum (AM) in the cores of massive stars to finally produce such fast-spinning magnetars upon core-collapse are still under debate.</description>

      <description>First author: Osbaldo Sanchez-Garcia
Stellar bars have been found to substantially influence the stellar populations properties in galaxies, affecting their ability of forming stars. While this can be easily seen when studying galaxies in relatively isolated environments, such kind of analysis takes a higher degree of complexity when cluster galaxies are considered, due to the variety of interactions which can potentially occur in these denser environments. We use IFU MUSE data from the GASP survey to study the combined effect of the presence of a stellar bar and of ram pressure, on spatially resolved properties of stellar populations.</description>

      <description>First author: Pia Jakobus
Using relativistic supernova simulations of massive progenitor stars with a quark-hadron equation of state (EoS) and a purely hadronic EoS, we identify a distinctive feature in the gravitational-wave signal that originates from a buoyancy-driven mode (g-mode) below the proto-neutron star convection zone. The mode frequency lies in the range $200\lesssim f\lesssim 800,\text{Hz}$ and decreases with time. As the mode lives in the core of the proto-neutron star, its frequency and power are highly sensitive to the EoS, in particular the sound speed around twice saturation density.</description>

The relationship between galaxies and haloes is central to the description of galaxy formation, and a fundamental step towards extracting precise cosmological information from galaxy maps. However, this connection involves several complex processes that are interconnected. Machine Learning methods are flexible tools that can learn complex correlations between a large number of features, but are traditionally designed as deterministic estimators. In this work, we use the IllustrisTNG300-1 simulation and apply neural networks in a binning classification scheme to predict probability distributions of central galaxy properties, namely stellar mass, colour, specific star formation rate, and radius, using as input features the halo mass, concentration, spin, age, and the overdensity on a scale of 3 $h^{-1}$ Mpc.</description>

Mrk 1239 is a highly polarized NLS1 in the optical band, whose $0.3-3$ keV spectrum has remained remarkably consistent over more than two decades of observation. Previous analysis of this object suggested that the soft X-ray band was dominated by emission lines (collisionally and/or photoionized) from the distant host galaxy as the X-ray emission from the central engine was highly obscured. New XMM-Newton data of Mrk 1239 are presented here to investigate the soft X-ray band of this galaxy with high resolution.</description>

NGC 4839 is the brightest galaxy (cD) of the NGC 4839 group at $R\approx 1$ Mpc in the south-west of the Coma cluster, which is known to be falling into Coma. However, it has been controversial whether it is in the first phase of infall or in the second phase of infall after passing the Coma center. We present a wide field study of globular clusters (GCs) in NGC 4839 and its environment based on Hyper Suprime-Cam $gr$ images in the Subaru archive.</description>

Multiple populations (MPs), characterized by variations in light elemental abundances, have been found in stellar clusters in the Milky Way, Magellanic Clouds, as well as several other dwarf galaxies. Based on a large amount of observations, mass has been suggested to be a key parameter affecting the presence and appearance of MPs in stellar clusters. To further investigate the existence of MPs in low-mass clusters and explore the mass threshold for MP formation, we carried out a project studying the stellar population composition in several low-mass Galactic globular clusters.</description>

We presented the multiwavelength analysis of a heavily obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) in NGC 449. We first constructed a broadband X-ray spectrum using the latest NuSTAR and XMM-Newton data. Its column density ($\simeq 10^{24} \rm{cm}^{-2}$) and photon index ($\Gamma\simeq 2.4$) were reliably obtained by analyzing the broadband X-ray spectrum. However, the scattering fraction and the intrinsic X-ray luminosity could not be well constrained. Combined with the information obtained from the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrum and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we derived its intrinsic X-ray luminosity ($\simeq 8.</description>

      <description>First author: Roshna K
Primordial non-Gaussianity has set strong constraints on models of the early universe. Studies have shown that Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC), which is an attempt to extend inflationary scenario to planck scales, leads to a strongly scale dependent and oscillatory non-Gaussianity. In particular, the non-Gaussianity function $f_{_{\rm NL}}(k_1,, k_2,, k_3)$ generated in LQC, though similar to that generated during slow roll inflation at small scales, is highly scale dependent and oscillatory at large wavelengths.</description>

We apply a population-orbit superposition method to 16 galaxies in the Fornax cluster observed with MUSE/VLT in the context of the Fornax3D project. By fitting the luminosity distribution, stellar kinematics, and age and metallicity maps simultaneously, we obtained the internal stellar orbit distribution, as well as the age and metallicity distribution of stars on different orbits for each galaxy. Based on the model, we decompose each galaxy into a dynamically cold disk (orbital circularity $\lambda_z\ge0.</description>

The ROSAT-selected tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate RX J133157.6-324319.7 (J1331), was detected in 1993 as a bright (0.2-2 keV flux of $(1.0 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$), ultra-soft ($kT=0.11 \pm 0.03$ keV) X-ray flare from a quiescent galaxy ($z=0.05189$). During its fifth All-Sky survey (eRASS5) in 2022, SRG/eROSITA detected the repeated flaring of J1331, where it had rebrightened to an observed 0.2-2 keV flux of $(6.</description>

We present a study of the distribution of galaxies along the radius of 157 groups and clusters of galaxies (200~km~s$^{-1}$ &amp;lt; $\sigma$ &amp;lt; 1100~km~s$^{-1}$) of the local Universe (0.01 &amp;lt; $z$ &amp;lt; 0.1). We introduced a new boundary of galaxy systems and identified it with the splashback radius $R_{sp}$. We also identified the central region of galaxy systems with a radius of $R_c$. These radii are defined by the observed integrated distribution of the total number of galaxies depending on the squared distance from the center of the groups/clusters coinciding, as a rule, with the brightest galaxy.</description>

      <description>Isabel M. E. Santos-Santos,
We use the APOSTLE Local Group (LG) cosmological hydro-simulations to examine the properties of &amp;amp;#34;backsplash&amp;amp;#34; galaxies, i.e, dwarfs which were within the virial boundaries of the Milky Way (MW) or M31 in the past, but are today outside their virial radius ($r_{200}$). More than half of all dwarfs between $1-2\,r_{200}$ of each primary are backsplash. More distant backsplash systems, i.e., those reaching distances well beyond $2\,r_{200}$, are typically close to apocentre of nearly radial orbits, and, therefore, essentially at rest relative to their primary.</description>

We present a smoothed density-corrected $V_{\rm max}$ technique for building a random catalog for property-dependent galaxy clustering estimation. This approach is essentially based on the density-corrected $V_{\rm max}$ method of Cole(2011), with three improvements to the original method. To validate the improved method, we generate two sets of flux-limited samples from two independent mock catalogs with different $k+e$ corrections. By comparing the two-point correlation functions, our results demonstrate that the random catalog created by the smoothed density-corrected $V_{\rm max}$ approach provides a more accurate and precise measurement for both sets of mock samples than the commonly used $V_{\rm max}$ method and redshift shuffled method.</description>

There exists a well known relation between the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the center of galaxies and their bulge mass or central velocity dispersion. This suggests a co-evolution between SMBH and their galaxy hosts. Our aim is to study this relation specifically for radio loud galaxies, and as a function of redshift $z$. We selected a sample of radio-galaxies and AGN by cross-matching the low radio frequency sources from VLA FIRST with spectroscopically confirmed sources from wide field surveys including SDSS DR14 ugriz and DES DR2 grzY in optical, WISE in infrared, and the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic survey.</description>

The spectral line energy distribution of carbon monoxide contains information about the physical conditions of the star forming molecular hydrogen gas; however, the relation to local radiation field properties is poorly constrained. Using ~ 1-2 kpc scale ALMA observations of CO(3-2) and CO(4-3), we characterize the CO(4-3)/CO(3-2) line ratios of local analogues of main sequence galaxies at z ~ 1-2, drawn from the DYNAMO sample. We measure CO(4-3)/CO(3-2) across the disk of each galaxy and find a median line ratio of $R_{43} = 0.</description>

In the FLARES (First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations) suite of hydrodynamical simulations, we find the high redshift ($z&amp;gt;5$) intrinsic size-luminosity relation is, surprisingly, negatively sloped. However, after including the effects of dust attenuation we find a positively sloped UV observed size-luminosity relation in good agreement with other simulated and observational studies. In this work, we extend this analysis to probe the underlying physical mechanisms driving the formation and evolution of the compact galaxies driving the negative size-mass/size-luminosity relation.</description>

Context. Our Galaxy is composed of different stellar populations with varying chemical abundances, which are thought to imprint the composition of planet building blocks (PBBs). As such, the properties of stars should affect the properties of planets and small bodies formed in their systems. In this context, high-resolution spectroscopic surveys open a window into the chemical links between and their host stars. Aims. We aim to determine the PBB composition trends for various stellar populations across the Galaxy by comparing the two large spectroscopic surveys APOGEE and GALAH.</description>

      <description>Chia-Hsuan Cheng,
To investigate the dynamical properties of globular clusters, the surface brightness and kinematic data were collected and fitted to a family of lowered isothermal models called LIMEPY models. For 18 studied globular clusters, the amounts of concentration, truncation, and anisotropy were determined. In addition, the cluster mass, half-mass radius, distance, and mass-to-light ratio were also obtained. In general, LIMEPY models could describe these clusters well. Among these 18 clusters, NGC 5139, NGC 6388, and NGC 7078 were claimed to be candidates to host intermediate-mass black holes in literature.</description>

Many studies concluded that magnetic fields suppress star formation in molecular clouds and Milky Way like galaxies. However, most of these studies are based on fully developed fields that have reached the saturation level, with little work on investigating how an initial weak primordial field affects star formation in low metallicity environments. In this paper, we investigate the impact of a weak initial field on low metallicity dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <description>First author: Andrea Antoni
When collapse of the iron core in a massive red or yellow supergiant does not lead to a neutrino-driven explosion, a significant fraction of the convective hydrogen envelope will fall in towards the black hole formed from the collapsing core. The random velocity field in the convective envelope results in finite specific angular momentum in each infalling shell. Using 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we follow the infall of this material to small radii, resolving the circularization radii of the flow.</description>

      <description>Maryna Ishchenko,
This study is aimed at investigating the dynamic evolution of the orbits of stellar globular clusters (GCs). To integrate the orbits backward in time, the authors use models of the time-varying potentials derived from cosmological simulations, which are closest to the potential of the Galaxy. This allows for estimating the probability of close passages (collisions) of GCs with respect to each other and the Galactic center (GalC) in the Galaxy undergoing dynamic changes in the past.</description>

      <description>Timothy Gburek,
We present a Keck/MOSFIRE, rest-optical, composite spectrum of 16 typical, gravitationally-lensed, star-forming, dwarf galaxies at $1.7 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.6$ ($z_{\rm{mean}}=2.30$), all chosen independent of emission-line strength. These galaxies have a median stellar mass of $\log(M_\ast/\rm{M_\odot})_{\rm{med}} = 8.29^{+0.51}_{-0.43}$ and a median star formation rate of $\rm{SFR_{Hα}^{med} = 2.25^{+2.15}_{-1.26}\ M_\odot\ yr^{-1}}$. We measure the faint, electron-temperature-sensitive, $[O III]$ $λ$4363 emission line at $2.5σ$ ($4.1σ$) significance when considering a bootstrapped (statistical-only) uncertainty spectrum.</description>

We present the e-TidalGCs Project which aims at modeling and predicting the extra-tidal features surrounding all Galactic globular clusters for which 6D phase space information, masses and sizes are available (currently 159 globular clusters). We focus the analysis and presentation of the results on the distribution of extra-tidal material on the sky, and on the different structures found at different heliocentric distances. We emphasize the wide variety of morphologies found: beyond the canonical tidal tails, our models reveal that the extra-tidal features generated by globular clusters take a wide variety of shapes, from thin and elongated shapes, to thick, and complex halo-like structures.</description>

Our understanding of the kinematic properties of multiple stellar populations (mPOPs) in Galactic globular clusters (GCs) is still limited compared to what we know about their chemical and photometric characteristics. Such limitation arises from the lack of a comprehensive observational investigation of this topic. Here we present the first homogeneous kinematic analysis of mPOPs in 56 GCs based on high-precision proper motions computed with Hubble Space Telescope data.</description>

We examine the binding energy of massive stripped-envelope core collapse supernova (SECCSN) progenitors with the stellar evolution code MESA, and find that only the jittering jets explosion mechanism can account for explosions where carbon-oxygen cores with masses of $&amp;gt;20M_\odot$ collapse to leave a neutron star (NS) remnant. We calculate the binding energy at core collapse under the assumption that the remnant is a NS. Namely, stellar gas above mass coordinate of $~1.</description>

      <description>First author: Eleanor R. Downing
It is routinely assumed that galaxy rotation curves are equal to their circular velocity curves (modulo some corrections) such that they are good dynamical mass tracers. We take a visualisation-driven approach to exploring the limits of the validity of this assumption for a sample of $33$ low-mass galaxies ($60&amp;lt;v_\mathrm{max}/\mathrm{km},\mathrm{s}^{-1}&amp;lt;120$) from the APOSTLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Only $3$ of these have rotation curves nearly equal to their circular velocity curves at $z=0$, the rest are undergoing a wide variety of dynamical perturbations.</description>

In 1181 AD, Chinese and Japanese observers reported a bright Guest Star&#39; in the constellation Chuanshe, unmoving and visible for 185 days. In 2013, D. Patchick discovered a unique nebula surrounding a unique star, with two groups attributing this structure, named Pa 30&amp;rsquo;, to be the supernova remnant of SN 1181, as a sub-subclass of supernova, the low-luminosity Type Iax. Here, I provide a wide range of new observational evidence: First, a detailed analysis of the original Chinese and Japanese reports places the `Guest Star&amp;rsquo; of 1181 into a small region with the only interesting source being Pa 30.</description>

Luminous Red Galaxies, or LRGs, are representative of the most massive galaxies and were originally selected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as good tracers of large scale structure. They are dominated by by uniformly old stellar populations, have low star formation rates, early type morphologies, and little cold gas. Despite having old stellar populations and little in situ star formation, studies have shown that they have grown their stellar mass since z=1, implying that they grow predominantly via the accretion of satellites.</description>

(abridged) Stable circumbinary discs around evolved post-Asymptotic Giant branch (post-AGB) binary systems show many similarities with protoplanetary discs around young stellar objects. These discs can provide constraints on both binary evolution and the formation of macrostructures within circumstellar discs. Here we focus on one post-AGB binary system: IRAS08544-4431. We aim to refine the physical model of IRAS08544-4431 with a radiative transfer treatment and continue the near-infrared and mid-infrared interferometric analysis covering the H-, K-, L-, and N-bands.</description>

Among the supernovae (SNe) that show strong interaction with the circumstellar medium, there is a rare subclass of Type Ia supernovae, SNe Ia-CSM, that show strong narrow hydrogen emission lines much like SNe IIn but on top of a diluted over-luminous Type Ia spectrum. In the only previous systematic study of this class (Silverman et al. 2013), 16 objects were identified, 8 historic and 8 from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF).</description>

      <description>First author: Benjamin Wehmeyer
While modelling the galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of stable elements provides insights to the formation history of the Galaxy and the relative contributions of nucleosynthesis sites, modelling the evolution of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs) can provide supplementary timing information on recent nucleosynthesis. To study the evolution of SLRs, we need to understand their spatial distribution. Using a 3-dimensional GCE model, we investigated the evolution of four SLRs: Mn-53, Fe-60, Hf-182, and Pu-244 with the aim of explaining detections of recent (within the last $\approx$1-20 Myr) deposition of live Mn-53, Fe-60, and Pu-244 of extrasolar origin into deep-sea reservoirs.</description>

Jet precession is sometimes invoked to explain asymmetries in radio galaxy (RG) jets and &amp;ldquo;X/S/Z-shape&amp;rdquo; radio galaxies, caused by the presence of a binary black hole companion to the source active galactic nucleus (AGN) or by accretion instabilities. We present a series of simulations of radio galaxy jet precession to examine how these sources would evolve over time, including a passive distribution of cosmic ray electrons (CRe) so we can model radio synchrotron emissions and create synthetic radio maps of the sources.</description>

We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2020bio, a double-peaked Type IIb supernova (SN) discovered within a day of explosion, primarily obtained by Las Cumbres Observatory and Swift. SN 2020bio displays a rapid and long-lasting initial decline throughout the first week of its light curve, similar to other well-studied Type IIb SNe. This early-time emission is thought to originate from the cooling of the extended outer envelope of the progenitor star that is shock-heated by the SN explosion.</description>

      <description>First author: Sudipta Sikder
The reported detection of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES collaboration is significantly stronger than standard astrophysical predictions. One possible explanation is an early radio excess above the cosmic microwave background. Such a radio background could have been produced by high redshift galaxies, if they were especially efficient in producing low-frequency synchrotron radiation. We have previously studied the effects of such an inhomogeneous radio background on the 21-cm signal; however, we made a simplifying assumption of isotropy of the background seen by each hydrogen cloud.</description>

Massive elliptical galaxies align pointing towards each other in the structure of the Universe. Such alignments are well-described at large scales through a linear relation with respect to the tidal field of the large-scale structure. At such scales, galaxy alignments are sensitive to the presence of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). The shape of the BAO feature in galaxy alignment correlations differs from the traditional peak in the clustering correlation function.</description>

Optical spectropolarimetry of the normal thermonuclear supernova SN2019np from -14.5 to +14.5 days relative to B-band maximum detected an intrinsic continuum polarization, p(cont), of 0.21+-0.09% at the first epoch. Between days -11.5 to +05, p(cont) remained about 0 and by day +14.5 was again significant at 0.19+-0.10%. Not considering the first epoch, the dominant axis of SiII(6355A) was roughly constant, staying close to the continuum until both rotated in opposite directions on day +14.</description>

With its origin coming from several sources (Big Bang, stars, cosmic rays) and given its strong depletion during its stellar lifetime, the lithium element is of great interest as its chemical evolution in the Milky Way is not well understood at present. To help constrain stellar and galactic chemical evolution models, numerous and precise lithium abundances are necessary for a large range of evolutionary stages, metallicities, and Galactic volume.</description>

Accreted stellar populations are comprised of the remnants of destroyed galaxies, and often dominate the `stellar haloes&amp;amp;#39; of galaxies such as the Milky Way (MW). This ensemble of external contributors is a key indicator of the past assembly history of a galaxy. We introduce a novel statistical method that uses the unbinned metallicity distribution function (MDF) of a stellar population to estimate the mass spectrum of its progenitors.</description>

      <description>First author: Alis J. Deason
Accreted stellar populations are comprised of the remnants of destroyed galaxies, and often dominate the `stellar haloes&amp;rsquo; of galaxies such as the Milky Way (MW). This ensemble of external contributors is a key indicator of the past assembly history of a galaxy. We introduce a novel statistical method that uses the unbinned metallicity distribution function (MDF) of a stellar population to estimate the mass spectrum of its progenitors.</description>

      <description>First author: Paola Santini
This conference proceedings paper provides a short summary of the constraints presented by Menci et al. (2020) and Menci et al. (2022) to dynamical dark energy models. Dynamical dark energy (DDE) models have been proposed to address several observational tensions arising within the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario. Different DDE models, parameterized by different combinations of the local value of the equation-of-state parameter $w_0$ and its time derivative $w_a$, predict different maximal abundance of massive galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <description>First author: Souvik Manna
We have estimated the magnetic field strengths of a sample of seven galaxies using their non-thermal synchrotron radio emission at metre wavelengths, and assuming energy equipartition between magnetic fields and cosmic ray particles. Spatially resolved star formation rates (SFR) were estimated for the seven galaxies along with five galaxies studied previously. For the combined sample of twelve galaxies, the equipartition magnetic fields (B$\textrm{eq}$) are correlated with the SFR surface densities ($\Sigma\textrm{SFR}$) at sub-kpc scales with B$\textrm{eq}$ $\propto$ $\Sigma\textrm{SFR}^ {0.</description>

      <description>First author: Luke R. Holden
AGN-driven outflows are now routinely used in models of galaxy evolution as a feedback mechanism, however many of their properties remain highly uncertain. Perhaps the greatest source of uncertainty is the electron density of the outflowing gas, which directly affects derived kinetic powers and mass outflow rates. Here we present spatially-resolved, wide spectral-coverage Xshooter observations of the nearby active galaxy IC 5063 (z=0.001131), which shows clear signatures of outflows being driven by shocks induced by a radio jet interacting with the ISM.</description>

      <description>First author: Robert W. Bickley
The kinematic disturbances associated with major galaxy mergers are known to produce gas inflows, which in turn may trigger accretion onto the supermassive black holes (SMBH) of the participant galaxies. While this effect has been studied in galaxy pairs, the frequency of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in fully coalesced post-merger systems is poorly constrained due to the limited size or impurity of extant post-merger samples.</description>

      <description>First author: Andrew King
A suggested model for quasi&amp;ndash;periodic eruptions (QPEs) from galaxy nuclei invokes a white dwarf in an eccentric orbit about the central massive black hole. I point out that the extreme mass ratio allows the presence of strong Lindblad resonances in the accretion disc. These are important for the stability of mass transfer, and may trigger the eruptions themselves by rapidly transferring angular momentum from the accretion disc (which is likely to be eccentric itself) to the orbiting WD companion at pericentre.</description>

Methods based on Deep Learning have recently been applied on astrophysical parameter recovery thanks to their ability to capture information from complex data. One of these methods is the approximate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) which have demonstrated to yield consistent posterior distribution into the parameter space, helpful for uncertainty quantification. However, as any modern neural networks, they tend to produce overly confident uncertainty estimates and can introduce bias when BNNs are applied to data.</description>

Type IIn supernovae potentially constitute a large fraction of the gravitationally lensed supernovae predicted to be found with upcoming facilities. However, the local rate is used for these estimates, which is assumed to be independent of properties such as the host galaxy mass. Some studies hint that a host galaxy mass bias may exist for IIn supernovae. This paper aims to provide an updated local IIn supernova-to-core-collapse ratio based on data from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS).</description>

      <description>First author: Callum Witten
Although low-mass star-forming galaxies are the leading candidates of the reionisation process, we cannot conclusively rule out high-mass star-forming galaxies as candidates. While most simulations indicate the former is the best candidate some models suggest that at z &amp;gt; 6 massive, UV-bright galaxies - &amp;ldquo;oligarchs&amp;rdquo; - account for at least 80% of the ionising budget. To test this hypothesis we target massive (log10 (M*$[Msol]$) &amp;gt; 10), UV-bright (MUV ~ -22) Lya emitters at z &amp;gt; 7 in archival data, observed with similar resolution spectrographs (VLT/X-shooter and Keck/MOSFIRE).</description>

The timescales on which galaxies move out of the blue cloud to the red sequence ($\tau^{}\mathrm{Q}$) provide insight into the mechanisms driving quenching. Here, we build upon previous work, where we showcased a method to reconstruct the colour evolution of observed low-redshift galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey based on spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with ProSpect, together with a statistically-driven definition for the blue and red populations.</description>

The recent image of our galaxy&amp;rsquo;s supermassive black hole Sgr A* derived from the 7 April 2017 data of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration shows multiple hot spots in its accretion disk. Using the analytical framework, we demonstrate that the observed hot spots may not be disjoint elements but causally linked components (&amp;ldquo;petals&amp;rdquo;) of one rotating quasi-stationary macro-structure formed in the thermo-vorticial field within the accretion disk.</description>

      <description>First author: Bradley C. Whitmore
A long-standing problem when deriving the physical properties of stellar populations is the degeneracy between age, reddening, and metallicity. When a single metallicity is used for all star clusters in a galaxy, this degeneracy can result in $$catastrophic$&#39;$ errors for old globular clusters. Typically, approximately 10 - 20 % of all clusters detected in spiral galaxies can have ages that are incorrect by a factor of ten or more.</description>

Observations of the first billion years of cosmic history are currently limited. We demonstrate the synergy between observations of the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen and interferometric measurements of the corresponding spatial fluctuations. By jointly analysing data from SARAS3 (redshift $z\approx15-25$) and limits from HERA ($z\approx8$ and $10$), we produce the tightest constraints to date on the astrophysics of galaxies 200 million years after the Big Bang.</description>

The spectrum ranges from 4-14 um, and shows many unique qualities including a flat-topped $[Ar III]$ 8.991 um profile, a strongly tilted $[Co III]$ 11.888 um feature, and multiple stable Ni lines.

We present a free-form model of SMACS0723, the first cluster observed with JWST. This model makes no strong assumptions about the distribution of mass (mostly dark matter) in the cluster and we use it to study the possible correlation between dark matter with the intracluster light and distribution of globular clusters. To explore the uncertainty in mass modelling, we derive three lens models based on spectroscopically confirmed systems and new candidate systems with redshifts predicted by the lens model derived from the spectroscopic systems.</description>

The introduction of deep wide-field surveys in recent years and the adoption of machine learning techniques have led to the discoveries of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ strong gravitational lensing systems and candidates. However, the discovery of multiply lensed transients remains a rarity. Lensed transients and especially lensed supernovae are invaluable tools to cosmology as they allow us to constrain cosmological parameters via lens modeling and the measurements of their time delays.</description>

Halo inhabitants are individual stars, stellar streams, star and globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies. Here we compare the two last categories that include objects of similar stellar mass, which are often studied as self-dynamical equilibrium systems. We discover that the half-light radius of globular clusters depends on their orbital pericenter and total energy, and that Milky Way (MW) tides may explain the observed correlation. We also suggest that the accretion epoch of stellar systems in the MW halo can be calibrated by the total orbital energy, and that such a relation is due to both the mass growth of the MW and dynamical friction affecting mostly satellites with numerous orbits.</description>

In all cases the contribution to the radio-EBL, per decade of flux, exhibits a two-humped distribution well matched to the AGN and star-forming galaxy (SFG) populations, and with each population contributing roughly equal energy.</description>

Subsonic turbulence plays a major role in determining properties of the intra cluster medium (ICM). We introduce a new Meshless Finite Mass (MFM) implementation in OpenGadget3 and apply it to this specific problem. To this end, we present a set of test cases to validate our implementation of the MFM framework in our code. These include but are not limited to: the soundwave and Kepler disk as smooth situations to probe the stability, a Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability as popular mixing instabilities, a blob test as more complex example including both mixing and shocks, shock tubes with various Mach numbers, a Sedov blast wave, different tests including self-gravity such as gravitational freefall, a hydrostatic sphere, the Zeldovich-pancake, and the nifty cluster as cosmological application.</description>

First, we analyze three cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (Eagle, Illustris, and IllustrisTNG), selecting snapshots spanning the bulk of cosmic history from comic noon ($z \sim 2$) to the present epoch, with stellar masses in the range $9 &amp;lt; \log(M_/M_{\odot}) &amp;lt; 12$.</description>

Stellar-mass black holes can become embedded within the gaseous disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Afterwards, their interactions are mediated by their gaseous surroundings. In this work, we study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded within AGN disks using a combination of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and analytic methods, focusing on environments in which the AGN disk scale height $H$ is [arXiv:2301.03629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03629)$\gtrsim$ the BBH sphere of influence.</description>

Thermonuclear and core-collapse supernova remnants (SNRs) are the nebular leftovers of defunct stars. Their morphology and emission properties provide insights into the evolutionary history of the progenitor star. But while some SNRs are spherical, as expected from a point-like explosion expanding into a roughly uniform medium, many others exhibit complex non-spherical morphologies which are often not easily explained. In this work, we use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to show that rectangular and jet-like morphologies can be explained by supernovae (SNe), either type Ia or type II, expanding within anisotropic, bipolar stellar wind bubbles driven by the progenitor star.</description>

Dwarf galaxies located in extremely under-dense cosmic voids are excellent test-beds for disentangling the effects of large-scale environment on galaxy formation and evolution. We present integral field spectroscopy for low-mass galaxies ($M_{\star}=10^{7}-10^{9}~M_{\odot}$) located inside (N=21) and outside (N=9) cosmic voids using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). Using measurements of stellar line-of-sight rotational velocity $v_{\mathrm{rot}}$ and velocity dispersion $σ_{\star}$, we test the tidal stirring hypothesis, which posits that dwarf spheroidal galaxies are formed through tidal interactions with more massive host galaxies.</description>

      <description>First author: Ryo Sawada
Details of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion mechanism still need to be fully understood. There is an increasing number of successful examples of reproducing explosions in multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations, but subsequent studies pointed out that the growth rates of the explosion energy $\dot{E}\mathrm{expl}$ of these simulations are insufficient to produce enough $^{56}$Ni to match observations. This issue is known as the `$^{56}$Ni problem&#39; in CCSNe. Recently, however, some studies have suggested that this $^{56}$Ni problem is derived from the simplicity of the explosion model.</description>

Cluster galaxies are subject to the ram pressure exerted by the intracluster medium, which can perturb or even strip away their gas while leaving the stars unperturbed. We model the distribution and kinematics of the stars and the molecular gas in four late-type cluster galaxies (JO201, JO204, JO206, and JW100), which show tails of atomic and ionized gas indicative of ongoing ram pressure stripping. We analyze MUSE@VLT data and CO data from ALMA searching for signatures of radial gas flows, ram pressure stripping, and other perturbations.</description>

The existence of multiple active galactic nuclei (AGN) at small projected distances on the sky is due to either the presence of multiple, in-spiraling SMBHs, or to gravitational lensing of a single AGN. Both phenomena allow us to address important astrophysical and cosmological questions. However, few kpc-separation multiple AGN are currently known. Recently, the newly-developed Gaia Multi peak (GMP) method provided numerous new candidate members of these populations.</description>

The cosmological principle states that the Universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic at large distance scales. There currently exist many observations which indicate a departure from this principle. It has been shown that many of these observations can be explained by invoking superhorizon cosmological perturbations and may be consistent with the Big Bang paradigm. Remarkably, these modes simultaneously explain the observed Hubble tension, i.e., the discrepancy between the direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble parameter.</description>

It has been well established in the local universe that galaxy properties differ based on the large-scale environment in which they reside. As luminous Lyman-alpha nebulae have been shown to trace overdense environments at z~2-3, comparing the properties of galaxies within Lyman-alpha nebulae systems to those in the field can provide insight into how and when locally-observed trends between galaxy properties and environment emerged. Six Lyman-alpha nebulae were discovered at z~2.</description>

We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) K-band (19 GHz) observations of the redshifted CO(1-0) line emission toward the radio galaxy TN J0924$-$2201 at $z=5.2$, which is one of the most distant CO-detected radio galaxies. With the angular resolution of $\sim2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;$, the CO(1-0) line emission is resolved into three clumps, within $\pm500$ km,s$^{-1}$ relative to its redshift, where is determined by Ly$\alpha$. We find that they locate off-center and 12-33 kpc away from the center of the host galaxy, which has counterparts in $HST$ $i$-band, $Spitzer$/IRAC and ALMA Band-6 (230 GHz; 1.</description>

In this work, we consider an interacting dark-fluid cosmological model in which energy exchange between dark matter and dark energy occurs through diffusion. After solving the background expansion history for a late-time universe, we attempt to constrain the cosmological parameters by comparing simulated values of the model against Supernovae Type 1A data. We consider four different cases and compare them against the LCDM model as the &amp;ldquo;true model&amp;rdquo;.</description>

We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of core convection for zero-age-main-sequence stars covering a mass range from 3 $M_\odot$ to 20 $M_\odot$. The simulations are performed with the fully compressible time-implicit code MUSIC. We study the efficiency of overshooting, which describes the ballistic process of convective flows crossing a convective boundary, as a function of stellar mass and luminosity. We also study the impact of artificially increasing the stellar luminosity for 3 $M_\odot$ models.</description>

Surveys of the matter distribution contain `fossil&amp;rsquo; information on possible non-Gaussianity that is generated in the primordial Universe. This primordial signal survives only on the largest scales where cosmic variance is strongest. By combining different surveys in a multi-tracer approach, we can suppress the cosmic variance and significantly improve the precision on the level of primordial non-Gaussianity. We consider a combination of an optical galaxy survey, like the recently initiated DESI survey, together with a new and very different type of survey, a 21 cm intensity mapping survey, like the upcoming SKAO survey.</description>

Cross-correlating the data of neutral hydrogen (HI) 21cm intensity mapping with galaxy surveys is an effective method to extract astrophysical and cosmological information. In this work, we investigate the cross-correlation of MeerKAT single-dish mode HI intensity mapping and China Space Station Telescope (CSST) spectroscopic galaxy surveys. We simulate a survey area of $\sim 300$ $\mathrm{deg}^2$ of MeerKAT and CSST surveys at $z=0.5$ using Multi-Dark N-body simulation.</description>

Many star-forming galaxies and those hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) show evidence of massive outflows of material in a variety of phases including ionized, neutral atomic, and molecular. Molecular outflows in particular have been the focus of recent interest as they may be responsible for removing gas from the galaxy, thereby suppressing star formation. As material is ejected from the cores of galaxies, interactions of the outflowing material with the interstellar medium can accelerate cosmic rays and produce high-energy gamma rays.</description>

Around 400 million years after the big bang, ultraviolet emission (Lyman Continuum, LyC) from star-forming galaxies drove the reionization of the Universe. How this radiation escapes the cold neutral gas (HI) of galaxies with sufficiently little absorption to reionize the intergalactic medium is poorly understood. HI has never been mapped in confirmed LyC-emitters, leaving major uncertainties on how LyC photons escape galaxies and ionize the intergalactic medium.</description>

These modelling improvements have a dramatic effect on the SMBH growth, star formation and gas depletion in the proto-clusters. We explore the parameter space of the models and report their effect on both star formation and the thermodynamics of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) as observed in X-ray and SZ observations.</description>

Combined with ALMA observations of far-infrared lines, multi-line diagnostics can be applied to the high-redshift galaxies in order to probe the physical conditions of the inter-stellar medium. We study the formation and evolution of galaxies using the FirstLight simulation suite, which provides outputs of 62 high-resolution, zoom-in galaxy simulations.</description>

      <description>First author: Anowar J. Shajib
Strong-lensing time delays enable measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$) independently of other traditional methods. The main limitation to the precision of time-delay cosmography is mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD). Some of the previous TDCOSMO analyses broke the MSD by making standard assumptions about the mass density profile of the lens galaxy, reaching 2% precision from seven lenses. However, this approach could potentially bias the $H_0$ measurement or underestimate the errors.</description>

Using 190,000 spectra from the seventeenth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the ultraviolet emission line properties in z=2 quasars. Specifically, we quantify how the shape of CIV 1549A and the equivalent width (EW) of HeII 1640A depend on the black hole mass and Eddington ratio inferred from MgII 2800A. Above L/L_Edd&amp;gt;0.2, there is a strong mass dependence in both CIV blueshift and HeII EW.</description>

In November 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) returned deep near-infrared images of Abell~2744 &amp;ndash; a powerful lensing cluster capable of magnifying distant, incipient galaxies beyond it. Together with the existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, this publicly available dataset opens a fundamentally new discovery space to understand the remaining mysteries of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. In this work, we detect and measure some 50,000 objects across the 45 arcmin$^2$ JWST footprint down to a $5,\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $\sim$29.</description>

      <description>First author: Zhang XueGuang
In this manuscript, an independent method is proposed to estimate opening angle of dust torus in AGN, through unique properties of Type-1.9 AGN with double-peaked broad H$\alpha$ (Type-1.9 DPAGN) coming from central accretion disk. Type-1.9 AGN without broad H$\beta$ can be expected by the commonly accepted unified model of AGN, considering central BLRs seriously obscured by dust torus with its upper boundary in the line of sight.</description>

We present new, deep optical observations of the early-type galaxy NGC 4278, which is located in a small loose group. We find that the galaxy lacks fine substructure, i.e., appears relaxed, out to a radius of $\sim$70 kpc. Our g- and i-band surface brightness profiles are uniform down to our deepest levels of $\sim$28 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. Combined with archival globular cluster (GC) number density maps and a new analysis of the total mass distribution, we find that the red GC subpopulation traces well the stellar mass density profile between 2.</description>

Next-generation spectroscopic surveys such as the MegaMapper, MUltiplexed Survey Telescope (MUST), MaunaKea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE), and Wide Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) are foreseen to increase the number of galaxy/quasar redshifts by an order of magnitude, with hundred millions of spectra that will be measured at $z&amp;gt;2$. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis for these surveys on the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO), the redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurement, the non-Gaussianity amplitude $f_{\rm NL}$, and the total neutrino mass $M_\nu$.</description>

      <description>First author: Alexander Johnson
Studying coupling between different galactic components is a challenging problem in galactic dynamics. Using basis function expansions (BFEs) and multichannel singular spectrum analysis (mSSA) as a means of dynamical data mining, we discover evidence for two multi-component disc-halo dipole modes in a Milky-Way-like simulated galaxy. One of the modes grows throughout the simulation, while the other decays throughout the simulation. The multi-component disc-halo modes are driven primarily by the halo, and have implications for the structural evolution of galaxies, including observations of lopsidedness and other non-axisymmetric structure.</description>

      <description>First author: A. -C. Buellet
The growth of instabilities is key to trigger a supernova explosion during the phase of stalled shock, immediately after the birth of a proto-neutron star (PNS). We assess the effect of stellar rotation on neutrino-driven convection and SASI when neutrino heating is taken into account. Rotation affects the frequency of the mode m=2 detectable with gravitational waves (GW). We use a linear stability analysis in the equatorial plane between the PNS and the stationary shock and consider a large range of specific angular momenta, neutrino luminosities and mass accretion rates.</description>

Previous studies have shown that the normalization and scatter of the galaxy &amp;lsquo;main sequence&amp;rsquo; (MS), the relation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass ($M_$), evolves over cosmic time. However, such studies often rely on photometric redshifts and/or only rest-frame UV to near-IR data, which may underestimate the SFR and $M_$ uncertainties. We use MAGPHYS+photo-z to fit the UV to radio spectral energy distributions of 12,380 galaxies in the COSMOS field at $0.</description>

This is the first of a series of papers that will introduce a user-friendly, detailed, and modular GALactic Chemical Evolution Model, GalCEM, that tracks isotope masses as a function of time in a given galaxy. The list of tracked isotopes automatically adapts to the complete set provided by the input yields. The present iteration of GalCEM tracks 86 elements broken down in 451 isotopes. The prescription includes massive stars, low-to-intermediate mass stars, and Type Ia supernovae as enrichment channels.</description>

We present proper motion measurements of oxygen-rich ejecta of the LMC supernova remnant N132D using two epochs of Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys data spanning 16 years. The proper motions of 120 individual knots of oxygen-rich gas were measured and used to calculate a center of expansion (CoE) of $\alpha$=05:25:01.71 and $\delta$=-69:38:41.64 (J2000) with a 1-$\sigma$ uncertainty of 2.90 arcseconds.

We compare the observed radial velocity of different arm tracers, taken near the tangent to a spiral arm. A slight difference is predicted by the density wave theory, given the shock predicted at the entrance to the inner spiral arm. In many of these spiral arms, the observed velocity offset confirms the prediction of the density wave theory (with a separation between the maser velocity and the CO gas peak velocity, of about 20 km/s) - when the observed offset is bigger than the error estimates.</description>

The assembly of supermassive black holes poses a challenge primarily because of observed quasars at high redshift, but additionally because of the current lack of observations of intermediate mass black holes. One plausible scenario for creating supermassive black holes is direct collapse triggered by the merger of two gas rich galaxies. This scenario allows the creation of supermassive stars with up to solar metallicity, where the enhanced metallicity is enabled by extremely rapid accretion.</description>

Line ratio diagnostics provide valuable clues on the source of ionizing radiation in galaxies with intense black hole accretion and starbursting events, like local Seyfert or galaxies at the peak of the star-formation history. We aim at providing a reference joint optical and mid-IR analysis for studying AGN identification via line ratios and test predictions from photoionization models. We obtained homogenous optical spectra with the Southern Africa Large Telescope for 42 Seyfert galaxies with IRS/Spitzer spectroscopy and X-ray to mid-IR multi-band data available.</description>

We study the spatially resolved stellar populations of 444 galaxies at $0.3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.0$ in two clusters (WHL0137-08 and MACS0647+70) and a blank field, combining imaging data from HST and JWST to perform spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling using pixedfit. The high spatial resolution of the imaging data combined with magnification from gravitational lensing in the cluster fields allows us to resolve some galaxies to sub-kpc scales (for 109 of our galaxies).</description>

Almost all massive galaxies today are understood to contain supermassive black holes (SMBH) at their centers. SMBHs grew by accreting material from their surroundings, emitting X-rays as they did so. X-ray Luminosity Functions (XLFs) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have been extensively studied in order to understand the AGN population&amp;rsquo;s cosmological properties and evolution. We present a new fixed rest-frame method to achieve a more accurate study of the AGN XLF evolution over cosmic time.</description>

In today&amp;rsquo;s era, a tremendous amount of data is generated by different observatories and manual classification of data is something which is practically impossible. Hence, to classify and categorize the objects there are multiple machine and deep learning techniques used. However, these predictions are overconfident and won&amp;rsquo;t be able to identify if the data actually belongs to the trained class. To solve this major problem of overconfidence, in this study we propose a novel Bayesian Neural Network which randomly samples weights from a distribution as opposed to the fixed weight vector considered in the frequentist approach.</description>

      <description>First author: Jed McKinney
Selecting the first galaxies at z&amp;gt;7-10 from JWST surveys is complicated by z&amp;lt;6 contaminants with degenerate photometry. For example, strong optical nebular emission lines at z&amp;lt;6 may mimic JWST/NIRCam photometry of z&amp;gt;7-10 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). Dust-obscured 3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 galaxies in particular are potentially important contaminants, and their faint rest-optical spectra have been historically difficult to observe. A lack of optical emission line and continuum measures for 3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 dusty galaxies now makes it difficult to test their expected JWST/NIRCam photometry for degenerate solutions with NIRCam dropouts.</description>

Redshift measurement has always been a constant need in modern astronomy and cosmology. And as new surveys have been providing an immense amount of data on astronomical objects, the need to process such data automatically proves to be increasingly necessary. In this article, we use simulated data from the Dark Energy Survey, and from a pipeline originally created to classify supernovae, we developed a linear regression algorithm optimized through novel automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks achieving an error score better than ordinary data pre-processing methods when compared with other modern algorithms (such as XGBOOST).</description>

We use the kinematic data of the stars in eight dwarf spheroidal galaxies to assess whether $f(R)$ gravity can fit the observed profiles of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of these systems without resorting to dark matter. Our model assumes that each galaxy is spherically symmetric and has a constant velocity anisotropy parameter $β$ and constant mass-to-light ratio consistent with stellar population synthesis models. We solve the spherical Jeans equation that includes the Yukawa-like gravitational potential appearing in the weak field limit of $f(R)$ gravity, and a Plummer density profile for the stellar distribution.</description>

We investigate the impact of the surface brightness (SB) limit on the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) using mock surveys generated from the Horizon Run 5 (HR5) simulation. We compare the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, GSMF, and size-stellar mass relation of the HR5 galaxies with empirical data and other cosmological simulations. The mean SB of simulated galaxies are computed using their effective radii, luminosities, and colors. To examine the cosmic SB dimming effect, we compute $k$-corrections from the spectral energy distributions of individual simulated galaxy at each redshift, apply the $k$-corrections to the galaxies, and conduct mock surveys based on the various SB limits.</description>

      <description>First author: M. A. Abdulrahman
For spiral galaxies, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and some physical parameters that concern the host galaxy such as spiral arm radius and density can play an important role in the morphological evolution of these galaxies. Considering the gravitational effect of the central black hole as a feeding mechanism, the gas flows from spiral arms to the accretion disk. Accordingly, we constructed our approach and derived an equation for the AGN luminosity that depends on parameters such as the black hole mass and the spiral arm density.</description>

We review the recent observations of protoplanetary disks together with relevant theoretical studies with an emphasis on the evolution of volatiles. In the last several years Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) provided evidence of grain growth, gas-dust decoupling, and sub-structures such as rings and gaps in the dust continuum. Molecular line observations revealed radial and vertical distributions of molecular abundances and also provided significant constraints on the gas dynamics such as turbulence.</description>

Wave (fuzzy) dark matter consists of ultralight bosons ($m \sim 10^{-22} \textrm{&amp;ndash;} 10^{-20},{\rm eV}$), featuring a compact solitonic core at the centre of a granular halo. Here we extend this model to a two-component wave dark matter, with distinct particle masses and coupled only through gravity, and investigate the resulting soliton-halo structure via cosmological simulations. Specifically, we assume wave dark matter contains $75$ per cent major component and $25$ per cent minor component, fix the major-component particle mass to $m_{\rm major}=1\times10^{-22},{\rm eV}$, and explore two different minor-component particle masses with $m_{\rm major}:m_{\rm minor}=3:1$ and $1:3$, respectively.</description>

We present a new description of cosmological evolution of the primordial magnetic field under the condition that it is non-helical and its energy density is larger than the kinetic energy density. We argue that the evolution can be described by four different regimes, according to whether the decay dynamics is linear or not, and whether the dominant dissipation term is the shear viscosity or the drag force.</description>

Calcium-rich supernovae (Ca-rich SNe) are faint, rapidly evolving transients whose progenitor system is yet to be determined. We derive the $\gamma$-ray deposition histories of five Ca-rich SNe from the literature in order to place constraints on possible progenitor systems. We find that the $ \gamma $-ray escape time, $ t_0 $, of the Ca-rich SNe sample is $\approx35$-$65 ,\rm{d}$, within the unoccupied region between Type Ia SNe and stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe).</description>

Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to originate from early Universe seed black holes of mass $M_\mathrm{BH} \sim 10^2$-10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$ and grown through cosmic time. Such seeds could be powering the active galactic nuclei (AGN) found in today&amp;amp;#39;s dwarf galaxies. However, probing a connection between the early seeds and local SMBHs has not yet been observationally possible. Massive black holes hosted in dwarf galaxies at intermediate redshifts, on the other hand, may represent the evolved counterparts of the seeds formed at very early times.</description>

      <description>Rune Strandberg
When the quality of multijunction solar cells becomes sufficiently high, radiative exchange of photons between cells has to be taken into account to properly model these devices. In this work it is shown how this radiative coupling can be accounted for in series connected multi-junction solar cells by constants called transfer coefficients. Under the assumption that the exchanged radiation only travels one way, from higher to lower band gaps, the transfer coefficients allows the relation between the voltage and current of the device to be expressed by a convenient mathematical expression.</description>

Using radiation-hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, we present a detailed ($0.1$ pc resolution), physically motivated portrait of a typical-mass dwarf galaxy before the epoch of reionization, resolving the formation and evolution of star clusters into individual $10:\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ star particles. In the rest-frame UV, the galaxy has an irregular morphology with no bulge or galactic disk, dominated by light emitted from numerous, compact, and gravitationally-bound star clusters.</description>

The assumption of isotropy &amp;ndash; that the Universe looks the same in all directions on large scales &amp;ndash; is fundamental to the standard cosmological model. This model forms the building blocks of essentially all of our cosmological knowledge to date. It is therefore critical to empirically test in which regimes its core assumptions hold. Anisotropies in the cosmic expansion are expected on small scales due to nonlinear structures in the late Universe, however, the extent to which these anisotropies might impact our low-redshift observations remains to be fully tested.</description>

${\rm H}_2$ detections are usually biased towards star-forming galaxies, whose low number statistics in clusters has led to contradictory results in the literature regarding the impact of environment on their ${\rm H}_2$ content, across redshifts. In this work, we employ the EAGLE simulation to investigate the relationship between the ${\rm H}2$ content of star-forming galaxies and their environment for redshifts spanning $0\leq z\leq 1$. To do so, we divide the sample into those that are bound to clusters and those that are not.</description>

We examine star formation and chemical enrichment in protoclusters (PCs) using cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the total star formation rate (SFR) in all PC ($&amp;gt;10^{14.4},h^{-1}$~M$\odot$) reaches $&amp;gt;10^4,\mathrm{M}\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, at $z=3$, equivalent to the observed PCs. The SFR in the Core region accounts for about $30%$ of the total star formation in the PC at $z\gtrsim1$, suggesting the importance of the outer regions to reveal the evolution of galaxy clusters.</description>

Although type Ia supernovae are so important in many astrophysical field, e.g. in cosmology, their explosion mechanism and progenitor system are still unclear. In physics, the relative equivalent width (REW) of the Si II 635.5 nm absorption feature reflects the velocity interval of silicon in the supernova ejecta and then may provide constraints on the explosion mechanism of SNe Ia. In this paper, we divide the SNe Ia into broad line (BL) and normal line (NL) subsamples based on their REW of Si II 635.</description>

We present strong model-marginalized limits on mixed hot dark matter scenarios, which consider both thermal neutrinos and thermal QCD axions.

After marginalizing over a number of well-motivated non-minimal background cosmologies, the tightest $95%$ CL upper bound we obtain is $0.</description>

The confirmation of the presence of very massive quiescent galaxies at epochs only 1-2 Gyr after the Big Bang $[1-8]$ has challenged models of cosmology and galaxy formation $[9]$. Producing sufficient numbers of these requires abundant numbers of the host dark matter halos to have been assembled and sufficient time for star formation to proceed extremely quickly and then cease just as rapidly. Ground-based spectroscopy has suggested ages of 200-300 Myr$[3]$ at redshifts $3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4$.</description>

The stellar cluster environment is expected to play a central role in the evolution of circumstellar disks. We use thermochemical modeling to constrain the dust and gas masses, disk sizes, UV and X-ray radiation fields, viewing geometries, and central stellar masses of 20 Class II disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We fit a large grid of disk models to $350$ GHz continuum, CO $J=3-2$, and HCO$^+$ $J=4-3$ ALMA observations of each target, and we introduce a procedure for modeling interferometric observations of gas disks detected in absorption against a bright molecular cloud background.</description>

An increase in satellite application has skyrocketed the number of satellites, especially in the low earth orbit (LEO). The major concern today is that these satellites become debris after the end of life, negatively affecting the space environment. As per the International Guidelines of the European Space Agency, it is mandatory to deorbit the satellite within 25 years of its end of life. This paper is aimed to design the solid chemical propellant thruster to deorbit the StudSat II from its original orbit to the lower orbit.</description>

Cosmic rays are relativistic particles that come to the Earth from outer space. Despite a great effort made in both experimental and theoretical research, their origin is still unknown. One of the main keys to understand their nature is the determination of its chemical composition as a function of primary energy. In this paper, we review the measurements of the mass composition above $10^{15}$ eV.</description>

Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD) and are well-known as a distance indicator. However, it is still unclear how WDs increase their mass near the Chandrasekhar limit and how the thermonuclear runaway happens. The observational clues associated with these open questions, such as the photometric data within hours to days since the explosion, are scarce. Thus, an essential way is to discover SNe Ia at specific epochs with optimal surveys.</description>

Radio plots of $l-b$, $l-v$, and $b-v$ show a cavity centered at ($l$, $b$) $\sim$ (150$^{\circ}$, 50.$^{\circ}$) and extending about $\pm$33$^{\circ}$. The best view of the cavity is at a velocity of -25 km s$^{-1}$, which shows a circular cross section on the back (receding) face.</description>

      <description>First author: Moritz M. M. Pleintinger
The presence of radioactive $^{26}$Al at 1.8 MeV reflects ongoing nucleosynthesis in the Milky Way. Diffuse emission from its decay can be measured with gamma-ray telescopes in space. The intensity, line shape, and spatial distribution of the $^{26}$Al emission allow a study of these nucleosynthesis sources. The line parameters trace massive-star feedback in the interstellar medium due to its 1~My lifetime. We aim to deepen previous studies of the $^{26}$Al emission in the Milky Way, using all gamma-ray data including single and double events as collected with SPI on INTEGRAL from 2003 until 2020.</description>

      <description>First author: J. ZuHone
The number density of galaxy clusters as a function of mass and redshift is a sensitive function of the cosmological parameters. To use clusters for cosmological parameter studies, it is necessary to determine their masses as accurately as possible, which is typically done via mass-observable scaling relations. X-ray observables can be biased by multiphase gas and projection effects, especially in the case where cluster temperatures and luminosities are estimated from single-model fits to all of the emission with a given radius.</description>

We predict the dwarf galaxy detection limits for the upcoming Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) survey that will cover 17,500 deg$^{2}$ of the sky with a wide field of view of 1.1 deg$^2$. The point-source depth reaches 26.3 mag in the $g$ band and 25.9 mag in the $i$ band. Constructing mock survey data based on the designed photometric bands, we estimate the recovery rate of artificial dwarf galaxies from mock point-source photometric catalogues.</description>

Bars play an important role in mixing material in the inner regions of galaxies and stimulating radial migration. Previous observations have found evidence for the impact of a bar on metallicity gradients but the effect is still inconclusive. We use the TYPHOON/PrISM survey to investigate the metallicity gradients along and beyond the bar region across the entire star-forming disk of five nearby galaxies. Using emission line diagrams to identify star-forming spaxels, we recover the global metallicity gradients ranging from -0.</description>

      <description>First author: Karin M. Sandstrom
JWST observations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission provide some of the deepest and highest resolution views of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) in nearby galaxies. If PAHs are well mixed with the atomic and molecular gas and illuminated by the average diffuse interstellar radiation field, PAH emission may provide an approximately linear, high resolution, high sensitivity tracer of diffuse gas surface density. We present a pilot study that explores using PAH emission in this way based on MIRI observations of IC 5332, NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 from the PHANGS-JWST Treasury.</description>

We present direct constraints on galaxy intrinsic alignments using the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3), the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and its precursor, the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Our measurements incorporate photometric red sequence (redMaGiC) galaxies from DES with median redshift $z\sim0.2-1.0$, luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from eBOSS at $z\sim0.8$, and also a SDSS-III BOSS CMASS sample at $z\sim0.5$. We measure two point intrinsic alignment correlations, which we fit using a model that includes lensing, magnification and photometric redshift error.</description>

This work focuses on the gas chemical composition of CGCG007-025. This compact dwarf is undergoing a galaxy wide star forming burst, whose spatial behaviour has been observed by VLT/MUSE. We present a new line measurement library to treat almost 7800 voxels. The direct method chemical analysis is limited to 484 voxels with good detection of the $[SIII]6312\AA$ temperature diagnostic line. The recombination fluxes are corrected for stellar absorption via a population synthesis.</description>

We present the Cosmological Double Radio Active Galactic Nuclei (CosmoDRAGoN) project: a large suite of simulated AGN jets in cosmological environments. These environments sample the intra-cluster media of galaxy clusters that form in cosmological smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, which we then use as inputs for grid-based hydrodynamic simulations of radio jets. Initially conical jets are injected with a range of jet powers, speeds (both relativistic and non-relativistic), and opening angles; we follow their collimation and propagation on scales of tens to hundreds of kiloparsecs, and calculate spatially-resolved synthetic radio spectra in post-processing.</description>

We present a review of the topics of X-ray stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) and changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGN). Stars approaching a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can be tidally disrupted and accreted. TDEs were first discovered in the X-ray regime and appear as luminous, giant-amplitude flares from inactive galaxies. The early X-ray observations with ROSAT also established the extreme X-ray spectral softness of these events with temperatures of order 50-100 eV that continues to be seen in the majority of more recently identified events.</description>

With the development of a series of Galaxy sky surveys in recent years, the observations increased rapidly, which makes the research of machine learning methods for galaxy image recognition a hot topic. Available automatic galaxy image recognition researches are plagued by the large differences in similarity between categories, the imbalance of data between different classes, and the discrepancy between the discrete representation of Galaxy classes and the essentially gradual changes from one morphological class to the adjacent class (DDRGC).</description>

      <description>First author: Alexandros Ziampras
The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a source of hydrodynamic turbulence that can drive vigorous vertical mixing and moderate levels of accretion in protoplanetary disks, and it could be observable in the near future. With high-resolution three-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics simulations, we modeled the behavior of the VSI in protoplanetary disks with and without embedded planets. We then measured its accretion and mixing capabilities by comparing the full Reynolds stress, which includes the contribution of nonaxisymmetric features, such as spiral arms and vortices, to the Reynolds stress due to the azimuthally averaged velocity field, which can be attributed to good approximation to the VSI.</description>

Galaxies in cosmic voids have been reported with properties related to a delayed evolution with respect to the Universe in general. These characteristics reflect the interaction of galaxies with the environment. However, it is not clear the degree of influence of the large-scale structure on the properties of void galaxies or, if these are only influenced by the low local density around them typical of these regions.</description>

We discover three nested pairs of weak shocks at roughly 50 kpc, 80 kpc and 130 kpc from the center. The total energy associated with the shocks is $\sim6\times10^{61}$ erg, with the central AGN driving a pair of weak shocks every 20-30 Myr with a power $P_{sh}\approx10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$.</description>

The characterization of the dynamical state of clusters is key to study their evolution, their selection, and use them as a cosmological probe.

Our goal is to study the distribution of the offset between the X-ray and optical centers in clusters of galaxies. We study the offset for eROSITA clusters.</description>

Our search reveals 6 robust candidates, 3 of which have recently been spectroscopically confirmed. One of these 3 is the previously controversial $z \simeq 12$ galaxy candidate UDF-22980 which is now detected in five JWST NIRCam medium-band filters (F182M, F210M, F430M, F460M and F480M), efficiently excluding alternative low-redshift solutions and allowing us to now report a secure photometric redshift of $z = 11.</description>

The derived c-M relation covers a wide halo mass range from $10^{11.</description>

Red geysers are a specific type of quiescent galaxy, denoted by twin jets emerging from their galactic centers. These bisymmetric jets possibly inject energy and heat into the surrounding material, effectively suppressing star formation by stabilizing cool gas. In order to confirm the presence and evolutionary consequences of these jets, this paper discusses the scaling, stacking, and conversion of 21-cm HI flux data sourced from the HI-MaNGA survey into HI gas-to-stellar mass (G/S) spectra.</description>

The gas-phase metallicity of galaxies encodes important information about galaxy evolution processes, in particular star formation, feedback, outflows and gas accretion, the relative importance of which can be extracted from systematic trends in the scatter of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR). Here, we use a sample of low redshift (0.02&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.055) galaxies from SDSS to investigate the nature of the scatter around the MZR, the observables and physical processes causing it, and its dependence on galaxy mass.</description>

We investigate the role of galaxy mergers on supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion and star formation quenching in three state-of-the-art cosmological simulations with contrasting physics models: EAGLE, Illustris and IllustrisTNG. We find that recently coalesced &amp;lsquo;post-mergers&amp;rsquo; in all three simulations have elevated SMBH accretion rates by factors of ~2-5. However, rapid (within 500 Myr of coalescence) quenching of star formation is rare, with incidence rates of 0.</description>

We present a machine-learning framework to accurately characterize morphologies of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) host galaxies within $z&amp;lt;1$. We first use PSFGAN to decouple host galaxy light from the central point source, then we invoke the Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) to estimate whether the host galaxy is disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, or indeterminate. Using optical images from five bands of the HSC Wide Survey, we build models independently in three redshift bins: low $(0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.</description>

      <description>First author: Facundo Rodriguez
Motivated by observational results, we use hydrodynamical numerical simulations to study the alignment of the central galaxies in groups with the surrounding structures. This approach allows us to analyse galaxy and group properties not available in observations. To perform this analysis, we use a modified version of the two-point cross-correlation function and a measure of the angle between the semi-major axes of the central galaxies and the larger structures.</description>

In this paper we present CALSAGOS: Clustering ALgorithmS Applied to Galaxies in Overdense Systems which is a PYTHON package developed to select cluster members and to search, find, and identify substructures. CALSAGOS is based on clustering algorithms and was developed to be used in spectroscopic and photometric samples. To test the performance of CALSAGOS we use the S-PLUS&amp;rsquo;s mock catalogues and we found an error of 1% - 6% on member selection depending on the function that is used.</description>

We present new neutral atomic carbon $[CI]$(3P1-3P0) mapping observations within the inner ~7 kpc and ~4 kpc of the disks of NGC3627 and NGC4321 at a spatial resolution of 190 pc and 270 pc, respectively, using the ALMA Atacama Compact Array (ACA). We combine these with the CO(2-1) data from PHANGS-ALMA, and literature $[CI]$ and CO data for two other starburst and/or active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies (NGC1808, NGC7469), to study: a) the spatial distributions of CI and CO emission; b) the observed line ratio RCICO = I_$[CI]$(1-0)/I_CO(2-1) as a function of various galactic properties; and c) the abundance ratio of $[CI/CO]$.</description>

We measure the molecular gas environment near recent ($&amp;lt; 100$ yr old) supernovae (SNe) using $\sim1&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;$ or $\leq 150$pc resolution CO (2-1) maps from the PHANGS-ALMA survey of nearby star-forming galaxies. This is arguably the first such study to approach the scales of individual massive molecular clouds ($M_{\rm mol} \gtrsim 10^{5.3}$ M$_{\odot}$). Using the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC), we identify 63 SNe within the PHANGS-ALMA footprint.</description>

Spatial curvature is one of the most fundamental parameters in our current concordance flat $\Lambda$CDM model of the Universe. The goal of this work is to investigate how the constraint on the spatial curvature is affected by an assumption on the sound horizon scale. The sound horizon is an essential quantity to use the standard ruler from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs).</description>

      <description>First author: Nicholas Fraser Boardman
The gas metallicity distributions across individual galaxies and across galaxy samples can teach us much about how galaxies evolve. Massive galaxies typically possess negative metallicity gradients, and mass and metallicity are tightly correlated on local scales over wide range of galaxy masses; however, the precise origins of such trends remain elusive. Here, we employ data from SDSS-IV MaNGA to explore how gas metallicity depends on local stellar mass density and on galactocentric radius within individual galaxies.</description>

Nearly all intragroup (IGL) and intracluster light (ICL) comes from stars that are not bound to any single galaxy but were formed in galaxies and later unbound from them. In this review we focus on the physical properties - phase space properties, metallicity and age distribution - of the ICL and IGL components of the groups and clusters in the local universe, within 100 Mpc distance.</description>

We use the ROGER code by de los Rios et al. to classify galaxies around a sample of X-ray clusters into five classes according to their positions in the projected phase space diagram: cluster galaxies, backsplash galaxies, recent infallers, infalling galaxies, and interlopers. To understand the effects of the cluster environment to the evolution of galaxies, we compare across the five classes: stellar mass, specific star formation rate, size, and morphology.</description>

This transient source was discovered by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search in January 2012 and has continued its eruptive variability since then. Photometry of AT 2016blu reveals at least 19 outbursts in 2012-2022. AT 2016blu&amp;rsquo;s outbursts show irregular variability with multiple closely spaced peaks of varying brightness.</description>

We study the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) for matter density averaged over spherical cells. The leading part to the PDF is defined by the dynamics of the spherical collapse whereas the next-to-leading part comes from the integration over fluctuations around the saddle-point solution. The latter calculation receives sizable contributions from unphysical short modes and must be renormalized. We propose a new approach to renormalization by modeling the effective stress-energy tensor for short perturbations.</description>

We see late time (5 to 42 years) emission from nine of the eleven Type II SNe (eight Type IIP/L, one IIb). We consider radioactive decay, circumstellar medium (CSM) interactions, pulsar/engine driven emission, dust echoes, and shock perturbed binary companions as possible sources of emission.</description>

Modeling the growth histories of specific galaxies often involves generating the entire population of objects that arise in a given cosmology and selecting systems with appropriate properties. This approach is highly inefficient when targeting rare systems such as the extremely luminous high-redshift galaxy candidates detected by JWST. Here, we present a novel framework for generating merger trees with branches that are guaranteed to achieve a desired halo mass at a chosen redshift.</description>

We conducted one-dimensional stellar evolutionary numerical simulations to build blue supergiant stellar models with a very low-envelope mass and a super-Eddington luminosity of 10^7Lo that mimic the last phase of a common envelope evolution (CEE) where a neutron star (NS) accretes mass from the envelope and launches jets that power the system. Common envelope jets supernovae (CEJSNe) are CEE transient events where a NS spirals-in inside the envelope and then the core of a red supergiant (RSG) star accretes mass and launches jets that power the transient event.</description>

Hot ionized gas is important in the baryon cycle of galaxies and contributes the majority of their missing baryons&#39;&#39;. Until now, most semi-analytic models of galaxy formation have paid little attention to hot gaseous haloes and their X-ray emission. In this paper, we adopt the one-dimensional model from Sharma et al. instead of the isothermal sphere to describe the radial distribution of hot gas in the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model.</description>

ALMA observations have revealed that many high redshift galaxies are surrounded by extended (10-15 kpc) $[CII]$-emitting halos which are not predicted by even the most advanced zoom-in simulations. Using a semi-analytical model, in a previous work we suggested that such halos are produced by starburst-driven, catastrophically cooling outflows. Here, we further improve the model and compare its predictions with data from 7 star-forming ($10\lesssim \rm SFR/ M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}&amp;lt;100$) galaxies at z=4-6, observed in the ALPINE survey.</description>

Massively parallel multi-object spectrographs are on the leading edge of cosmology instrumentation. The highly successful Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) which begun survey operations in May 2021, for example, has 5,000 robotically-actuated multimode fibers, which deliver light from thousands of individual galaxies and quasars simultaneously to an array of high-resolution spectrographs off-telescope. The redshifts are individually measured, thus providing 3D maps of the Universe in unprecedented detail, and enabling precise measurement of dark energy expansion and other key cosmological parameters.</description>

We present fast (~200s sampling) ugriz photometry of the low mass AGN NGC 4395 with the Liverpool Telescope, followed by very fast (3s sampling) us, gs, rs, is and zs simultaneous monitoring with HiPERCAM on the 10.4m GTC. These observations provide the fastest ever AGN multiband photometry and very precise lag measurements. Unlike in all other AGN, gs lags us by a large amount, consistent with disc reprocessing but not with reprocessing in the Broad Line Region (BLR).</description>

Joint analysis of CMB and large-scale structure at high redshifts provide new and unique windows into unexplored epochs of early structure formation. Here, we demonstrate how cosmic infrared background and high-redshift galaxies can be jointly analysed with CMB to probe the epoch of helium reionization ($2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4$) on the light cone using kinetic Sunyaev Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich tomography. Characterising this epoch has great potential significance for understanding astrophysics of galaxy formation, quasar activity and formation of the super-massive black holes.</description>

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are supermassive black holes with luminous accretion disks found in some galaxies, and are thought to play an important role in galaxy evolution. However, traditional optical spectroscopy for identifying AGN requires time-intensive observations. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish AGN host galaxies from non-active galaxies using a sample of 210,000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies. We evaluate the CNN on 33,000 galaxies that are spectrally classified as composites, and find correlations between galaxy appearances and their CNN classifications, which hint at evolutionary processes that affect both galaxy morphology and AGN activity.</description>

      <description>First author: D. Navarro-Almaida
HCN, HNC, and their isotopologues are ubiquitous molecules that can serve as chemical thermometers and evolutionary tracers to characterize star-forming regions. Despite their importance in carrying information that is vital to studies of the chemistry and evolution of star-forming regions, the collision rates of some of these molecules have not been available for rigorous studies in the past. We perform an up-to-date gas and dust chemical characterization of two different star-forming regions, TMC 1-C and NGC 1333-C7, using new collisional rates of HCN, HNC, and their isotopologues.</description>

We use data from the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi gamma-ray space telescope (Fermi-LAT) to analyze the faint gamma-ray source located at the center of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. In the 4FGL-DR3 catalog, this source is associated with the globular cluster, M54, which is coincident with the dynamical center of this dwarf galaxy. We investigate the spectral energy distribution and spatial extension of this source, with the goal of testing two hypotheses: (1) the emission is due to millisecond pulsars within M54, or (2) the emission is due to annihilating dark matter from the Sgr halo.</description>

New optical photometric, spectrocopic and imaging polarimetry data are combined with publicly available data to study some of the physical properties of the two H-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSN) SN 2021bnw and SN 2021fpl. For each SLSN, the best-fit parameters obtained from the magnetar model with \texttt{MOSFiT} do not depart from the range of parameter obtained on other SLSNe discussed in the literature. A spectral analysis with \texttt{SYN++} shows that SN 2021bnw is a W Type, Fast evolver, while SN 2021fpl is a 15bn Type, Slow evolver.</description>

The Cosmological Principle, that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales, underpins the standard model of cosmology. However, a recent analysis of 1.36 million infrared-selected quasars has identified a significant tension in the amplitude of the number-count dipole compared to that derived from the CMB, thus challenging the Cosmological Principle. Here we present a Bayesian analysis of the same quasar sample, testing various hypotheses using the Bayesian evidence.</description>

Low-mass galaxies are highly susceptible to environmental effects that can efficiently quench star formation. We explore the role of ram pressure in quenching low-mass galaxies ($M_{}\sim10^{5-9},\rm{M}{\odot}$) within 2 Mpc of Milky Way (MW) hosts using the FIRE-2 simulations. Ram pressure is highly variable across different environments, within individual MW haloes, and for individual low-mass galaxies over time. The impulsiveness of ram pressure &amp;ndash; the maximum ram pressure scaled to the integrated ram pressure prior to quenching &amp;ndash; correlates with whether a galaxy is quiescent or star-forming.</description>

During the spectral transition, the brightness in the individual photometric bands increased up to $\approx$0.6 in the optical bands and up to $\approx$1.1 magnitudes in the UV bands. The brightening was accompanied by a blueward shift of the optical spectrum.</description>

Classification of galaxy morphology is a challenging but meaningful task for the enormous amount of data produced by the next-generation telescope. By introducing the adaptive polar coordinate transformation, we develop a rotationally invariant supervised machine learning (SML) method that ensures consistent classifications when rotating galaxy images, which is always required to be satisfied physically but difficult to achieve algorithmically. The adaptive polar coordinate transformation, compared with the conventional method of data augmentation by including additional rotated images in the training set, is proved to be an effective and efficient method in improving the robustness of the SML methods.</description>

Neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) are born when the final collapse of the stellar core terminates the lives of stars more massive than about 9 Msun. This can trigger the powerful ejection of a large fraction of the star&amp;rsquo;s material in a core-collapse supernova (CCSN), whose extreme luminosity is energized by the decay of radioactive isotopes such as 56Ni and 56Co. When evolving in close binary systems, the compact relics of such infernal catastrophes spiral towards each other on orbits gradually decaying by gravitational-wave emission.</description>

Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) Galaxies are an important type of active galactic nucleus (AGN), generally expected to be accreting at high Eddington rate. The properties of their outflows and importance of AGN feedback remain intriguing. We report on the discovery of fast outflowing warm absorbers (WAs) in the NLS1 PG 1001+054, with velocities in the range of 7000 to 9000 kilometers per second. They are identified with blueshifted Lyman alpha, N v and Si iv lines in the high resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectra taken with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).</description>

It has long been speculated that Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies (BCDs) are formed through the interaction between low-mass gas-rich galaxies, but a few candidates of such systems have been studied in detail. We study a sample of compact star-forming dwarf galaxies that are selected from a merging dwarf galaxy catalog. We present a detailed study of their spectroscopic and structural properties. We find that these BCDs looking galaxies host extended stellar shells and thus are confirmed to be a dwarf-dwarf merger.</description>

We study the young star cluster populations in 23 dwarf and irregular galaxies observed by the HST Legacy ExtraGalactic Ultraviolet Survey (LEGUS), and examine relationships between the ensemble properties of the cluster populations and those of their host galaxies: star formation rate (SFR) density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). A strength of this analysis is the availability of SFRs measured from temporally resolved star formation histories which provide the means to match cluster and host-galaxy properties on several timescales (1-10, 1-100, and 10-100~Myr).</description>

Hydrodynamical interaction in circumbinary discs (CBDs) plays a crucial role in various astrophysical systems, ranging from young stellar binaries to supermassive black hole binaries in galactic centers. Most previous simulations of binary-disc systems have adopted locally isothermal equation of state. In this study, we use the grid-based code $\texttt{Athena++}$ to conduct a suite of two-dimensional viscous hydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary accretion on a cartesian grid, resolving the central cavity of the binary.</description>

Both galaxies are experiencing young ($\sim$100 Myr), synchronised bursts of star formation with $\log({\rm sSFR/Gyr^{-1}} )\sim$1.3-1.4, yet SFRs of just $\sim 0.2 M_\odot\ {\rm yr}^{-1}$. They have sub-solar ($Z\sim0.2Z_\odot$) gas-phase metallicities and are connected by an even more metal-poor star-forming bridge.</description>

Galaxy clusters detected through the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect are a powerful cosmological probe from which constraints on cosmological parameters such as $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\sigma_8$ can be derived. The measured cluster tSZ signal can be, however, contaminated by Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) emission, as the CIB is spatially correlated with the cluster tSZ field. We quantify the extent of this contamination by applying the iterative multi-frequency matched filter (iMMF) cluster-finding method to mock Planck-like data from the Websky simulation.</description>

The idea of ultralight scalar (axion) dark matter is theoretically appealing and may resolve some small-scale problems of cold dark matter; so it deserves careful attention. In this work we carefully analyze tunneling of the scalar field in dwarf satellites due to the tidal gravitational force from the host halo. The tidal force is far from spherically symmetric; causing tunneling along the axis from the halo center to the dwarf, while confining in the orthogonal plane.</description>

We conduct hydrodynamical MOND simulations of isolated disc galaxies over the stellar mass range $M_{\star}/M_\odot = 10^7 - 10^{11}$ using the adaptive mesh refinement code \textsc{phantom of ramses} (\textsc{por}), an adaptation of the \textsc{ramses} code with a Milgromian gravity solver. The scale lengths and gas fractions are based on observed galaxies, and the simulations are run for 5~Gyr. The main aim is to see whether existing sub-grid physics prescriptions for star formation and stellar feedback reproduce the observed main sequence and reasonably match the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation that captures how the local and global star formation rates relate to other properties.</description>

Halo inhabitants are individual stars, stellar streams, star and globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies. Here we compare the two last categories that include objects of similar stellar mass, which are often studied as self-dynamical equilibrium systems. We discover that the half-light radius of globular clusters depends on their orbital pericenter and total energy, and that Milky Way (MW) tides may explain the observed correlation. We also suggest that the accretion epoch of stellar systems in the MW halo can be calibrated by the total orbital energy, and that such a relation is due to both the mass growth of the MW and dynamical friction affecting mostly satellites with numerous orbits.</description>

      <description>First author: Wolfram Kollatschny
IRAS23226-3843 has previously been classified as a changing-look AGN based on X-ray and optical spectral variations. In 2019, Swift observations revealed a strong rebrightening in X-ray and UV fluxes in comparison to observations in 2017. We took follow-up Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR observations together with optical spectra (SALT and SAAO 1.9m telescope) from 2019 until 2021. IRAS23226-3843 showed a strong X-ray and optical outburst in 2019.</description>

We investigate the main tensions within the current standard model of cosmology from the perspective of the void size function in BOSS DR12 data. For this purpose, we present the first cosmological constraints on the parameters $S_8\equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ and $H_0$ obtained from voids as a stand-alone probe. We rely on an extension of the popular volume-conserving model for the void size function, tailored to the application on data, including geometric and dynamic distortions.</description>

We report the detection of a high density of redshift $z\approx 10$ galaxies behind the foreground cluster Abell 2744, selected from imaging data obtained recently with NIRCam onboard JWST by three programs &amp;ndash; GLASS-JWST, UNCOVER, and DDT-2756. To ensure robust estimates of the lensing magnification $\mu$, we use an improved version of our model that exploits the first epoch of NIRCam images and newly obtained MUSE spectra, and avoids regions with $\mu&amp;gt;5$ where the uncertainty may be higher.</description>

      <description>First author: Duncan Farrah
The assembly of stellar and supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in elliptical galaxies since $z\sim1$ can help to diagnose the origins of locally-observed correlations between SMBH mass and stellar mass. We therefore construct three samples of elliptical galaxies, one at $z\sim0$ and two at $0.7\lesssim z \lesssim2.5$, and quantify their relative positions in the $M_{BH}-M_*$ plane. Using a Bayesian analysis framework, we find evidence for translational offsets in both stellar mass and SMBH mass between the local sample and both higher redshift samples.</description>

      <description>First author: Tony Bonnaire
Degeneracies among parameters of the cosmological model are known to drastically limit the information contained in the matter distribution. In the first paper of this series, we shown that the cosmic web environments; namely the voids, walls, filaments and nodes; can be used as a leverage to improve the real-space constraints on a set of six cosmological parameters, including the summed neutrino mass. Following-upon these results, we propose to study the achievable constraints of environment-dependent power spectra in redshift space where the velocities add up information to the standard two-point statistics by breaking the isotropy of the matter density field.</description>

We investigate structural properties of massive galaxy populations in the central regions of five very massive galaxy clusters at z~1.4-1.7 from the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich effect survey. We probe the connection between galaxy structure and broad stellar population properties, at stellar masses log(M/Msun)&amp;gt;10.85. We find that quiescent and star-forming cluster galaxy populations are largely dominated by bulge- and disk-dominated sources, respectively, with relative contributions consistent with those of field counterparts.</description>

We present a new definition of cosmic void and a publicly available code with the algorithm that implements it. In this void finder, underdense regions are defined as free-form objects, called popcorn voids, made from the union of spheres of maximum volume with a given joint integrated underdensity contrast. This provides, for the first time, a definition of a void in the matter field whose abundance can be faithfully reproduced by excursion set theory, in particular using the Vdn model without any adjustment or cleaning process.</description>

We estimate a gas column density of $ \approx (1.3 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{20},T_{\rm{spin}}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$ with spin temperature, $T_{\rm{spin}} \leq 194$ K, consistent with the HI properties of other early-type galaxies and cool-core cluster BCGs.</description>

Recent observations show that the metallicity of the broad line region ($Z_{\rm BLR}$) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is solar-to-supersolar, which is positively correlated with the mass of supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm BH}$) and does not evolve with redshift up to $z \sim 7$. We revisit the $M_{\rm BH}-Z_{\rm BLR}$ correlation with more AGNs with $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^{6-8} M_{\odot}$ and find that the positive correlation become flat in low-mass range.</description>

Satellite galaxies of the Milky Way with high mass-to-light ratios and little baryon content, i.e. dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), are among the most promising targets to detect or constrain the nature of dark matter (DM) through its final annihilation products into high-energy photons. Previously, the assumption that DM emission from dSphs is point-like has been used to set strong constraints on DM candidates using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT).</description>

Our ALMA spectrum shows $[OIII]$ 88$\mu$m and $[CII]$158$\mu$m line detections at $4.0\sigma$ and $4.5\sigma$, respectively. The redshift and position of the $[OIII]$ line coincide with those of the JWST source, while the $[CII]$ line is blue-shifted by 90 km s$^{-1}$ with a spatial offset of $0.</description>

Cosmic voids are the largest and most underdense structures in the Universe. Their properties have been shown to encode precious information about the laws and constituents of the Universe. We show that machine learning techniques can unlock the information in void features for cosmological parameter inference. We rely on thousands of void catalogs from the GIGANTES dataset, where every catalog contains an average of 11,000 voids from a volume of $1~(h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$.</description>

We calculate the properties of 135 stellar supernovae using data from the Open Supernova Catalog. We generate temperatures, radii, luminosities, and expansion velocities using a spherically symmetric optically thick fireball model. These modeled parameters reveal trends that are common across different types of supernovae. We have identified distinct phases that appear across Type Ia, II, II P, and IIb supernovae. We note that there is a long period of reasonable continuous growth (Phase 1), giving credence to our simple model of an optically thick fireball.</description>

JWST/MIRI imaging of the nearby galaxies IC 5332, NGC 628, NGC 1365 and NGC 7496 from PHANGS reveals a richness of gas structures that in each case form a quasi-regular network of interconnected filaments, shells and voids. We examine whether this multi-scale network of structure is consistent with the fragmentation of the gas disk through gravitational instability. We use FilFinder to detect the web of filamentary features in each galaxy and determine their characteristic radial and azimuthal spacings.</description>

The era of Gravitational-Wave (GW) astronomy will grant the detection of the astrophysical GW background from unresolved mergers of binary black holes, and the prospect of probing the presence of primordial GW backgrounds. In particular, the low-frequency tail of the GW spectrum for causally-generated primordial signals (like a phase transition) offers an excellent opportunity to measure unambiguously cosmological parameters as the equation of state of the universe, or free-streaming particles at epochs well before recombination.</description>

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are standardizable candles that must be modeled empirically to yield cosmological constraints. To understand the robustness of this modeling to variations in the model training procedure, we build an end-to-end pipeline to test the recently developed SALT3 model. We explore the consequences of removing pre-2000s low-$z$ or poorly calibrated $U$-band data, adjusting the amount and fidelity of SN Ia spectra, and using a model-independent framework to simulate the training data.</description>

Quasars at cosmic dawn provide powerful probes of the formation and growth of the earliest supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the universe, their connections to galaxy and structure formation, and the evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). Hundreds of quasars have been discovered in the first billion years of cosmic history, with the quasar redshift frontier extended to z~7.6. Observations of quasars at cosmic dawn show that: (1) The number density of luminous quasars declines exponentially at z&amp;gt;5, suggesting that the earliest quasars emerge at z~10; the lack of strong evolution in their average spectral energy distribution indicates a rapid buildup of the AGN environment.</description>

After decades, the theoretical study of core-collapse supernova explosions is moving from parameterized, spherically symmetric models to increasingly realistic multi-dimensional simulations. Obtaining nucleosynthesis yields based on such multi-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations, however, is not straightforward and frequently tracer particles are employed. Tracer particles may be tracked in situ during the simulation, but often they are reconstructed in a post-processing step based on the information saved during the hydrodynamics simulation.</description>

We present a sample-variance-limited measurement of the temperature power spectrum ($TT$) of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) using observations of a $\sim! 1500 ,\mathrm{deg}^2$ field made by SPT-3G in 2018. We report multifrequency power spectrum measurements at 95, 150, and 220GHz covering the angular multipole range $750 \leq \ell &amp;lt; 3000$. We combine this $TT$ measurement with the published polarization power spectrum measurements from the 2018 observing season and update their associated covariance matrix to complete the SPT-3G 2018 $TT/TE/EE$ data set.</description>

Hubble Space Telescope imaging for 26 giant early-type galaxies, all drawn from the MAST archive, is used to carry out photometry of their surrounding globular cluster (GC) systems. Most of these targets are Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) and their distances range from 24 to 210 Mpc. The catalogs of photometry, completed with DOLPHOT, are publicly available. The GC color indices are converted to $[Fe/H]$ through a combination of 12-Gyr SSP (Single Stellar Population) models and direct spectroscopic calibration of the fiducial color index (F475W-F850LP).</description>

Gas accretion of embedded stellar-mass black holes,(sBHs) or stars in the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei,(AGNs) will modify the mass distribution of these sBHs and stars, which will also affect the migration of the sBHs/stars. \textbf{With the introduction of the mass accretion effect, we simulate the evolution of the sBH/star distribution function in a consistent way by extending the Fokker-Planck equation of sBH/star distributions to the mass-varying scenario, and explore the mass distribution of sBHs in the nuclear region of the galaxy centre.</description>

We investigate the accuracy and precision of triaxial dynamical orbit models by fitting two dimensional mock observations of a realistic N-body merger simulation resembling a massive early-type galaxy with a supermassive black hole (SMBH). We show that we can reproduce the triaxial N-body merger remnant&amp;rsquo;s correct black hole mass, stellar mass-to-light ratio and total enclosed mass (inside the half-light radius) for several different tested orientations with an unprecedented accuracy of 5-10%.</description>

Cool outflows are now commonly observed in galaxies, but their physical origin and driving mechanism remain unclear. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback can potentially accelerate cool galactic outflows via cosmic rays (CR) and radiation pressure on dust. Here we investigate the relative importance of CR and radiation feedback in AGNs, and we analyse the physical conditions for outflow launching as a function of the black hole accretion flow mode.</description>

We divide our sample of 11,419 blue star-forming galaxies at $z\approx1$ into three stellar mass ($M_$) subsamples and obtain detections (at $\geq 4\sigma$ significance) of the stacked HI 21cm emission signal from galaxies in all three subsamples.</description>

Motivated by the increasing number of gravitational wave detections of merging black holes (BHs) by LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA, BH binary mergers in the discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is investigated as a possible merger channel. In this pathway, BHs in the large gas disc are expected to encounter one another, become mutually bound as a BH binary system through interaction with the gas in the disc and subsequently inspiral through gravitational torques induced by the local gas until merger.</description>

Sophisticated spectral energy distribution (SED) models describe dust attenuation and emission using geometry parameters. This treatment is natural since dust effects are driven by the underlying star-dust geometry in galaxies. An example is the Starduster SED model, which divides a galaxy into a stellar disk, a stellar bulge, and a dust disk. This work utilises the Starduster SED model to study the efficacy of inferring geometry parameters using spatially integrated SED fitting.</description>

Bouncing models of cosmology, as they arise e.g. in loop quantum cosmology, can generate close-to-scale-invariant fluctuation spectra as observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, they are typically not Gaussian and also generate a bispectrum. It was proposed that these models can help to mitigate the large-scale anomalies of the CMB by considering large non-Gaussianities on very large scales, which decay exponentially on sub-horizon scales.</description>

The study of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) is vital in order to understand their respective nuclei bounded activity primarily triggered by the accretion disk and the associated corona. The hard X-ray emission characterised by the spectral index $\Gamma$ emitted by these sources in 2-10 keV band ionizes the nearby physical features like disk, BLR, NLR and provides a radiative configuration. However, based on previous studies, there is degeneracy in the evolution of $\Gamma$ across the redshift, wherein few studies display a systematic trend in the evolution and others rule out the systematic variation.</description>

We have developed a pipeline called \mentari to generate the far-ultraviolet to far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies from the \dustysage semi-analytic galaxy formation model (SAM). \dustysage incorporates dust-related processes directly on top of the basic ingredients of galaxy formation like gas infall, cooling, star formation, feedback, and mergers. We derive a physically motivated attenuation model from the computed dust properties in \dustysage, so each galaxy has a self-consistent set of attenuation parameters based on the complicated dust physics that occurred across the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s assembly history.</description>

Emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a commonly used indicator of star formation activity in galaxies, also has the potential to serve as an effective empirical tracer of molecular gas. We use a sample of 19 nearby galaxies with spatially resolved mid-infrared Spitzer spectroscopy, multi-wavelength optical and mid-infrared imaging, and millimeter interferometric CO(1-0) maps to investigate the feasibility of using PAH emission as an empirical proxy to estimate molecular gas mass.</description>

The Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) is a 12-band photometric survey using the 83-cm JAST telescope. Data Release 3 includes 47.4 million sources (29.8 million with $r \le 21$) on 3192 deg$^2$ (2881 deg$^2$ after masking). J-PLUS DR3 only provides star-galaxy classification so that quasars are not identified from the other sources. Given the size of the dataset, machine learning methods could provide a valid alternative classification and a solution to the classification of quasars.</description>

Voids occupy about 3/4 of the volume of the Universe and contain about 15% of its mass. Due to various observational selection effects, these structure elements and galaxies populating voids, are highly under-explored. This especially relates to the lowest mass galaxies which comprise the main void population. Studying the nearby voids allows us to improve our understanding of the most elusive void objects. We present the brief overview of the current status and the prospects of the study of the nearest voids and their galaxies.</description>

Action-based dynamical modelling, using stars as dynamical tracers, is an excellent diagnostic to estimate the underlying axisymmetric matter distribution of the Milky Way. However, the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s bar causes non-axisymmetric resonance features in the stellar disc. Using Roadmapping (an action-based dynamical modelling framework to estimate the gravitational potential and the stellar distribution function), we systematically quantify the robustness of action-based modelling in the presence of a bar.</description>

The fraction of ionizing photons escaping from galaxies, $f_{esc}$, is at the same time a crucial parameter in modelling reionization and a very poorly known quantity, especially at high redshift. Recent observations are starting to constrain the values of $f_{esc}$ in low-z star-forming galaxies, but the validity of this comparison remains to be verified. Applying at high-z the empirical relation between $f_{esc}$ and the UV slope trends derived from the Low-z Lyman Continuum Survey, we use the DELPHI semi-analytical galaxy formation model to estimate the global ionizing emissivity of high-z galaxies, which we use to compute the resulting reionization history.</description>

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which has recently become operational, is capable of detecting objects at record-breaking redshifts, $z \gtrsim 15$. This is a crucial advance for observational cosmology, as at these redshifts the differences between alternative cosmological models manifest themselves in the most obvious way. In recent years, some observational hints have emerged indicating that the Standard Cosmological Model could require correcting. One of these hints is related to the discovery of remote galaxies whose redshifts correspond to the very young Universe (less than one billion years after the Big Bang) but which are similar to nearby galaxies.</description>

The future astronomical imaging surveys are set to provide precise constraints on cosmological parameters, such as dark energy. However, production of synthetic data for these surveys, to test and validate analysis methods, suffers from a very high computational cost. In particular, generating mock galaxy catalogs at sufficiently large volume and high resolution will soon become computationally unreachable. In this paper, we address this problem with a Deep Generative Model to create robust mock galaxy catalogs that may be used to test and develop the analysis pipelines of future weak lensing surveys.</description>

Upcoming cosmological weak lensing surveys are expected to constrain cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision. In preparation for these surveys, large simulations with realistic galaxy populations are required to test and validate analysis pipelines. However, these simulations are computationally very costly &amp;ndash; and at the volumes and resolutions demanded by upcoming cosmological surveys, they are computationally infeasible. Here, we propose a Deep Generative Modeling approach to address the specific problem of emulating realistic 3D galaxy orientations in synthetic catalogs.</description>

Supersonic interacting flows occurring in phenomena such as protostellar jets give rise to strong shocks, and have been demonstrated in several laboratory experiments. To study such colliding flows, we use the AstroBEAR AMR code to conduct hydrodynamic simulations in three dimensions. We introduce variations in the flow parameters of density, velocity, and cross sectional radius of the colliding flows %radius in order to study the propagation and conical shape of the bow shock formed by collisions between two, not necessarily symmetric, hypersonic flows.</description>

Context. The globular cluster (GC) system of Circinus galaxy has not been probed previously partly because of the location of the galaxy at - 3.8$^\circ$ Galactic latitude which suffers severely from interstellar extinction, stellar crowding, and Galactic foreground contamination. However, the deep near-infrared (NIR) photometry by the VISTA Variables in the Via L&#39;actea Extended Survey (VVVX) in combination with the precise astrometry of Gaia EDR3 allow us to map GCs in this region.</description>

We present the discovery of as-of-yet non-repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) with the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) as a part of the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) Survey. FRB 20210117A was detected at the center frequency of 1271.5 MHz with a dispersion measure (DM) of $728.95\pm 0.01$ pc cm$^{-3}$. The sub-arcsecond localization of the burst led to the identification of its host galaxy at a $z=0.</description>

While bars are common in disk galaxies, their formation conditions are not well understood. We use $N$-body simulations to study bar formation and evolution in isolated galaxies consisting of a stellar disk, a classical bulge, and a dark halo. We consider 24 galaxy models that are similar to the Milky Way but differ in the mass and compactness of the classical bulge and halo concentration. We find that the bar formation requires $(Q_{T,\text{min}}/1.</description>

We report optical spectroscopic observations of four blue-excess dust-obscured galaxies (BluDOGs) identified by Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. BluDOGs are a sub-class of dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs, defined with the extremely red color $(i-[22]){\rm AB} \geq 7.0$; Toba et al. 2015), showing a significant flux excess in the optical $g$- and $r$-bands over the power-law fits to the fluxes at the longer wavelengths. Noboriguchi et al. (2019) has suggested that BluDOGs may correspond to the blowing-out phase involved in a gas-rich major merger scenario.</description>

      <description>First author: P. Frank Winkler
In order to better characterize the rich supernova remnant (SNR) population of M83 (NGC 5236), we have obtained high-resolution (about 85 km/s) spectra of 119 of the SNRs and SNR candidates in M83 with Gemini/GMOS, as well as new spectra of the young SNRs B12-174a and SN1957D. Most of the SNRs and SNR candidates have [S II]:H{\alpha} ratios that exceed 0.4. Combining these results with earlier studies we have carried out with MUSE and at lower spectroscopic resolution with GMOS, we have confirmed a total of 238 emission nebulae to be SNRs on the basis of their [S II]:H{\alpha} ratios, about half of which have emission lines that show velocity broadening greater than 100 km/s, providing a kinematic confirmation that they are SNRs and not H II regions.</description>

We use the Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) to estimate morphological parameters and associated uncertainties for $\sim 8$ million galaxies in the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Wide survey with $z \leq 0.75$ and $m \leq 23$. GaMPEN is a machine learning framework that estimates Bayesian posteriors for a galaxy&amp;rsquo;s bulge-to-total light ratio ($L_B/L_T$), effective radius ($R_e$), and flux ($F$). By first training on simulations of galaxies and then applying transfer learning using real data, we trained GaMPEN with $&amp;lt;1%$ of our dataset.</description>

      <description>First author: Ryan W. Pfeifle
The discovery over the last several decades of moderate luminosity AGNs in disk-dominated galaxies - which show no &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; bulges - suggests that secular mechanisms represent an important growth pathway for supermassive black holes in these systems. We present new follow-up NuSTAR observations of the optically-elusive AGNs in two bulgeless galaxies, NGC 4178 and J0851+3926. NGC 4178 was originally reported as hosting an AGN based on the detection of [Ne V] mid-infrared emission detected by Spitzer, and based on Chandra X-ray imaging it has since been argued to host either a heavily obscured AGN or a supernova remnant.</description>

We present a comparison of theoretical predictions of dust continuum and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission with new JWST observations in three nearby galaxies: NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496. Our analysis focuses on a total of 1063 compact stellar clusters and 2654 stellar associations previously characterized by HST in the three galaxies. We find that the distributions and trends in the observed PAH-focused infrared colors generally agree with theoretical expectations, and that the bulk of the observations is more aligned with models of larger, ionized PAHs.</description>

We analyse photometric observations of the supernova (SN) impostor SN 2000ch in NGC 3432 covering the time since its discovery. This source was previously observed to have four outbursts in 2000&amp;ndash;2010. Observations now reveal at least two additional outbursts in 2004-2006, and ten outbursts in 2013-2022. Outburst light curves are irregular and multipeaked, exhibiting a wide variety of peak magnitude, duration, and shape. The more recent outbursts (after 2010) repeat with a period of $198.</description>

We present growth of structure constraints from the cosmological analysis of the power spectrum multipoles of SDSS-III BOSS DR12 galaxies. We use the galaxy power spectrum model of Hand et al. (2017), which decomposes the galaxies into halo mass bins, each of which is modeled separately using the relations between halo biases and halo mass. The model combines Eulerian perturbation theory and halo model calibrated on $N$-body simulations to model the halo clustering.</description>

We present observations of a peculiar hydrogen- and helium-poor stripped-envelope (SE) supernova (SN) 2020wnt, primarily in the optical and near-infrared (near-IR). Its peak absolute bolometric magnitude of -20.9 mag and a rise time of 69~days are reminiscent of hydrogen-poor superluminous SNe (SLSNe~I), luminous transients potentially powered by spinning-down magnetars. Before the main peak, there is a brief peak lasting &amp;lt;10 days post-explosion, likely caused by interaction with circumstellar medium (CSM) ejected ~years before the SN explosion.</description>

Double source lensing provides a dimensionless ratio of distance ratios, a &amp;ldquo;remote viewing&amp;rdquo; of cosmology through distances relative to the gravitational lens, beyond the observer. We use this to test the cosmological framework, particularly with respect to spatial curvature and the distance duality relation. We derive a consistency equation for constant spatial curvature, allowing not only the investigation of flat vs curved but of the Friedmann-Lema^itre-Robertson-Walker framework itself.</description>

GDS J033218.92-275302.7 (here GS-14) is a $z\sim5.5$ galaxy detected in $[CII]$ as part of the ALPINE survey with unusual UV spectral features that have been interpreted as signatures of either a double stellar population or of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We exploited the multi-wavelength coverage of GS-14 to investigate the properties and the origin of its emission. We performed UV-to-NIR SED-fitting, with single/double stellar population and/or AGN component.</description>

As part of a larger completed Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Snapshot program, we observed the sites of six nearby core-collapse supernovae (SNe) at high spatial resolution: SN 2012A, SN 2013ej, SN 2016gkg, SN 2017eaw, SN 2018zd, and SN 2018aoq. These observations were all conducted at sufficiently late times in each SN&amp;rsquo;s evolution to demonstrate that the massive-star progenitor candidate identified in each case in pre-explosion imaging data had indeed vanished and was therefore most likely the actual progenitor.</description>

(Abridged) We study the galaxy mass-size relation in CARLA spectroscopically confirmed clusters at $1.4&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;2.8$, which span a total stellar mass $11.3&amp;lt;\mathrm{log}(M^c_*/M_{\odot})&amp;lt;12.6$ (halo mass $13.5 \lesssim \mathrm{log}(M^c_h/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 14.5$). Our main finding is that cluster passive ETG at $z \gtrsim 1.5$ with ${\rm log}(M/M_{\odot})&amp;gt;10.5$ are systematically $\gtrsim 0.2-0.3~{\rm dex}$ larger than field ETGs. The passive ETG average size evolution is slower at $1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;2$ when compared to the field.</description>

To better constrain the expected galaxy counts from these instruments, we use a vetted sample of 4,239 emission-line galaxies from the 3D-HST survey to measure the H$\alpha$ and [O III] $\lambda 5007$ luminosity functions between $1.16&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;1.90$; this sample is $\sim 4$ times larger than previous studies at this redshift.</description>

We derive the kernels and the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure counterterms for the one-loop bispectrum of dark matter and of biased tracers in real and redshift space. This requires the expansion of biased tracers up to fourth order in fluctuations. In the process, we encounter several subtleties related to renormalization. One is the fact that, in renormalizing the momentum, a local counterterm contributes non-locally.</description>

The $\gamma$-ray narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) can be considered to be the third class of $\gamma$-ray active galactic nuclei possessing relativistic jets. In this paper, we present multi-band high resolution Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images of the $\gamma$-ray NLS1, SDSS J211852.96$-$073227.5 (J2118$-$0732, $z=0.26$). We find a core-jet radio morphology and significant flux density variations in the radio core. The high brightness temperature estimated from VLBA images and core variability demonstrate that it exhibits substantial relativistic beaming effects.</description>

In a novel approach employing implicit likelihood inference (ILI), also known as likelihood-free inference, we calibrate the parameters of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations against observations, which has previously been unfeasible due to the high computational cost of these simulations. For computational efficiency, we train neural networks as emulators on ~1000 cosmological simulations from the CAMELS project to estimate simulated observables, taking as input the cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and use these emulators as surrogates to the cosmological simulations.</description>

The study of the properties of galaxies in the first billion years after the Big Bang is one of the major topic of current astrophysics. Optical/near-infrared spectroscopy of the afterglows of long Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide a powerful diagnostic tool to probe the interstellar medium (ISM) of their host galaxies and foreground absorbers, even up to the highest redshifts. We analyze the VLT/X-shooter afterglow spectrum of GRB 210905A, triggered by the Swift Neil Gehrels Observatory, and detect neutral-hydrogen, low-ionization, high-ionization, and fine-structure absorption lines from a complex system at z=6.</description>

We infer two masses for M31: $M_{\rm vir}= 2.81^{+1.48}{-0.75}\times10^{12}, M{\odot}$ using satellite galaxy phase space information derived with HST-based M31 proper motions and $M_{\rm vir}=2.99^{+1.32}{-0.68}\times10^{12}, M{\odot}$ using phase space information derived with the weighted average of HST+Gaia-based M31 proper motions.</description>

      <title>Evidence for supernova feedback sustaining gas turbulence in nearby star-forming galaxies</title>

      <description>First author: C. Bacchini
HI and CO observations indicate that the cold gas in galaxies is very turbulent. However, the turbulent energy is expected to be quickly dissipated, implying that some energy source is needed to explain the observations. The nature of such turbulence was long unclear, as even the main candidate, supernova (SN) feedback, seemed insufficient. Other mechanisms have been proposed, but without reaching a general consensus. The key novelty of our work is considering that the gas disc thickness and flaring increase the dissipation timescale of turbulence, thus reducing the energy injection rate required to sustain it.</description>

      <description>First author: S. Phillipps
The star formation rate in galaxies is well known to correlate with stellar mass (the `star-forming main sequence&amp;rsquo;). Here we extend this further to explore any additional dependence on galaxy surface brightness, a proxy for stellar mass surface density. We use a large sample of low redshift ($z \leq 0.08$) galaxies from the GAMA survey which have both SED derived star formation rates and photometric bulge-disc decompositions, the latter providing measures of disc surface brightness and disc masses.</description>

Disc galaxies commonly show asymmetric features in their morphology, such as warps and lopsidedness. These features can provide key information regarding the recent evolution of a given disc galaxy. In the nearby Universe, up to ~30 percent of late-type galaxies display a global non-axisymmetric lopsided mass distribution, but little attention has been paid to the origin of this perturbation. In this work, we study the origin of lopsided perturbations in simulated disc galaxies extracted from the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project.</description>

We present visual classifications of merger-induced tidal disturbances in 143 $\rm{M}* \sim 10^{11}\rm{M}\odot$ post-starburst galaxies at z$\sim$0.7 identified in the SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E Sample. This sample spectroscopically selects galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that have stopped their primary epoch of star formation within the past $\sim$500 Myrs. Visual classifications are performed on Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC) i-band imaging. We compare to a control sample of mass- and redshift-matched star-forming and quiescent galaxies from the Large Early Galaxy Census and find that post-starburst galaxies are more likely to be classified as disturbed than either category.</description>

Tidal disruption events (TDEs) around super massive black holes (SMBHs) are a potential laboratory to study super-Eddington accretion disks and sometimes result in powerful jets or outflows which may shine in the radio and sub millimeter bands. In this work, we model the thermal synchrotron emission of jets from general relativistic radiation magneto-hydrodynamics (GRRMHD) simulations of a BH accretion disk/jet system which assumes the TDE resulted in a magnetized accretion disk around a BH accreting at $\sim 12-25$ times the Eddington accretion rate.</description>

Context. The present study addresses a key question for our understanding of the relation between void galaxies and their environment: the relationship between luminous and dark matter in and around voids. Aims. To explore how empty of matter local Universe voids are, we study the full (dark+luminous) matter content of seven nearby cosmic voids that are fully contained within the CosmicFlows-3 volume. Methods. The cosmic voids matter density profiles are independently obtained using two different methods.</description>

      <description>First author: Jay Baptista
The shape and orientation of dark matter (DM) halos are sensitive to the micro-physics of the DM particle, yet in many mass models, the symmetry axes of the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s DM halo are often assumed to be aligned with the symmetry axes of the stellar disk. This is well-motivated for the inner DM halo but not for the outer halo. We use zoomed cosmological-baryonic simulations from the Latte suite of FIRE-2 Milky Way-mass galaxies to explore the evolution of the DM halo&amp;rsquo;s orientation with radius and time, with or without a major merger with a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) analog, and when varying the DM model.</description>

In this paper intergalatic electromagnetic cascades are used as a probe of cosmic ray sources. This is achieved as follows. In extragalactic space cosmic rays initiate electromagnetic cascades in which gamma-ray and neutrino emission arises. We used the joint analysis of cosmic ray data, along with extragalactic gamma-ray and neutrino emission, to study particle acceleration in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. Particle injection spectra depend on processes of particle acceleration, and here we discuss models with various injection spectra.</description>

A black hole can launch a powerful relativistic jet after it tidally disrupts a star. If this jet fortuitously aligns with our line of sight, the overall brightness is Doppler boosted by several orders of magnitude. Consequently, such on-axis relativistic tidal disruption events (TDEs) have the potential to unveil cosmological (redshift $z&amp;gt;$1) quiescent black holes and are ideal test beds to understand the radiative mechanisms operating in super-Eddington jets.</description>

The fiducial cosmological analyses of imaging galaxy surveys like the Dark Energy Survey (DES) typically probe the Universe at redshifts $z &amp;lt; 1$. This is mainly because of the limited depth of these surveys, and also because such analyses rely heavily on galaxy lensing, which is more efficient at low redshifts. In this work we present the selection and characterization of high-redshift galaxy samples using DES Year 3 data, and the analysis of their galaxy clustering measurements.</description>

Star formation laws are empirical relations between the cold gas (HI+H$_2$) content of a galaxy and its star formation rate (SFR), being crucial for any model of galaxy formation and evolution. A well known example of such laws is the Schmidt-Kennicutt law, which is based on the projected surface densities. However, it has been long unclear whether a more fundamental relation exists between the intrinsic volume densities.</description>

This paper represents an effort to provide robust constraints on cosmology and the galaxy-halo connection using a fully numerical model of small-scale galaxy clustering. We explore two extensions to the standard Halo Occupation Distribution model: assembly bias, whereby halo occupation depends on both halo mass and the larger environment, and velocity bias, whereby galaxy velocities do not perfectly trace the velocity of the dark matter within the halo.</description>

In this VERTICO science paper we aim to study how the star formation process depends on galactic environment and gravitational interactions in the context of galaxy evolution. We explore the scaling relation between the star formation rate (SFR) surface density and the molecular gas surface density, also known as the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, in a subsample of Virgo cluster spiral galaxies. We use new ACA and TP observations from the VERTICO-ALMA Large Program at 720pc resolution to resolve the molecular gas content, as traced by the 12CO(2-1) transition, across the disks of 37 spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster.</description>

Soft X-ray emission (0.5&amp;ndash;2.0 keV) plays a pivotal role in regulating the optical and UV emission in the AGNs. We collected a sample of 1811 AGNs from the SDSS database and obtained various parameters of Balmer lines, optical continuum, MgII line &amp;amp; UV continuum and studied their dependencies on soft X-ray luminosity. Based on the linear regression analysis, we found that FWHM${\text{MgII}}$ $\propto$ FWHM${\text{H}\beta}^{0.554}$ suggesting that UV emission is arising from a region relatively outside the broad line region (BLR) associated to the H$\beta$ emission and found a strong correlation between optical and UV luminosities (L${\text{MgII}}$ $\propto$ L${\text{H}\beta}^{0.</description>

We detected auroral emission line [OII]$\lambda\lambda$7320,7330 which allows us to measure chemical abundance by direct T$_e$ method. We found that the scatter of the oxygen abundance derived by the strong line method is large. The oxygen abundances 12 + log(O/H) derived by strong line method vary from ~7.</description>

Fields in cosmology, such as the matter distribution, are observed by experiments up to experimental noise. The first step in cosmological data analysis is usually to de-noise the observed field using an analytic or simulation driven prior. On large enough scales, such fields are Gaussian, and the de-noising step is known as Wiener filtering. However, on smaller scales probed by upcoming experiments, a Gaussian prior is substantially sub-optimal because the true field distribution is very non-Gaussian.</description>

In the simulations, stars are sampled from the stellar initial mass function (IMF) down to the hydrogen burning limit of 0.08 M$_\odot$. Mass conservation is enforced within a radius of 1 pc for the formation massive stars.</description>

Some Hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae are likely powered by a magnetar central engine, making their luminosity larger than common supernovae. Although a significant amount of X-ray flux is expected from the spin down of the magnetar, direct observational evidence is still to be found, giving rise to the &amp;ldquo;missing energy&amp;rdquo; problem. Here we present NuSTAR observations of nearby SN 2018hti 2.4y (rest frame) after its optical peak.</description>

We studied the variability properties of the linear polarization of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets on parsec-scales using stacking. Our sample is drawn from the MOJAVE program and consists of 436 AGNs manifesting core-jet morphology and having at least five VLBA observing epochs at 15 GHz from January 1996 through August 2019, with some additional archival VLBA data reduced by us. We employed a stacking procedure and constructed maps of (i) standard deviation of fractional polarization and electric vector position angle (EVPA) over epochs as the measure of variability, (ii) median polarization degree to quantify typical values in time.</description>

      <description>First author: He Zhao
Although diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) were discovered over 100 years ago, for most of them, their origins are still unknown. Investigation on the correlations between different DIBs is an important way to study the behavior and distributions of their carriers. Based on stacking thousands of spectra from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey, we study the correlations between two DIBs at 442.8 nm ($\lambda$442.8) and 862.1 nm ($\lambda$862.</description>

      <description>First author: Martin P. Rey
We present a new suite of cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical ($\approx 20, \mathrm{pc}$) simulations of Milky-Way mass galaxies to study how a varying mass ratio for a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) progenitor impacts the $z=0$ chemodynamics of halo stars. Using the genetic modification approach, we create five cosmological histories for a Milky-Way-mass dark matter halo ($M_{200} \approx 10^{12} , M_\mathrm{\odot}$), incrementally increasing the stellar mass ratio of a $z\approx2$ merger from 1:25 to 1:2, while fixing the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s final dynamical, stellar mass and large-scale environment.</description>

We examine the HI gas kinematics of galaxy pairs in two clusters and a group using Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) WALLABY pilot survey observations. We compare the HI properties of galaxy pair candidates in the Hydra I and Norma clusters, and the NGC 4636 group, with those of non-paired control galaxies selected in the same fields. We perform HI profile decomposition of the sample galaxies using a tool, {\sc baygaud} which allows us to de-blend a line-of-sight velocity profile with an optimal number of Gaussian components.</description>

Known as the &amp;ldquo;Missing Baryon Problem&amp;rdquo;, about one-third of baryons in the local universe remain unaccounted for. The missing baryons are thought to reside in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) of the cosmic web filaments, which are challenging to detect. Recent Chandra X-ray observations from Kov&#39;acs et al. (2019) used a novel stacking analysis and detected an OVII absorption line toward the sightline of a luminous quasar, hinting that the missing baryons may reside in the WHIM.</description>

We investigate infrared properties of OGLE4 Mira variables in our Galaxy. For each object, we cross-identify the WISE, 2MASS, and IRAS counterparts. We present various IR two-color diagrams (2CDs) and period-magnitude and period-color relations for the Mira variables. Generally, the Miras variables with longer periods are brighter in the IR fluxes and redder in the IR colors. In this work, we also revise and update the previous catalog of AGB stars in our Galaxy using the new sample of OGLE4 Mira variables.</description>

      <description>First author: David C. Baughman
The variability of the X-ray emission from active galactic nuclei is often characterized using time lags observed between soft and hard energy bands in the detector. The time lags are usually computed using the complex cross spectrum, which is based on the Fourier transforms of the hard and soft time series data. It has been noted that some active galactic nuclei display soft X-ray time lags, in addition to the more ubiquitous hard lags.</description>

The far-IR/sub-mm wavelength range contains a wealth of diagnostic information that is important for understanding the role of radio AGN in galaxy evolution. Here we present the results of Herschel PACS and SPIRE observations of a complete sample of 46 powerful 2Jy radio AGN at intermediate redshifts (0.05 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.7), which represent the deepest pointed observations of a major sample of radio AGN undertaken by Herschel.</description>

Aims. We validate a semi-analytical model for the covariance of real-space 2-point correlation function of galaxy clusters. Methods. Using 1000 PINOCCHIO light cones mimicking the expected Euclid sample of galaxy clusters, we calibrate a simple model to accurately describe the clustering covariance. Then, we use such a model to quantify the likelihood analysis response to variations of the covariance, and investigate the impact of a cosmology-dependent matrix at the level of statistics expected for the Euclid survey of galaxy clusters.</description>

We study the formation of the first galaxies in overdense regions modelled by the FOREVER22 simulation project. Our simulations successfully reproduce the star formation rates and the $M_{\rm UV}-M_{\rm star}$ relations of candidate galaxies at $z \sim 10-14$ observed by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We suggest that the observed galaxies are hosted by dark-matter haloes with $M_{\rm h} \sim 10^{11}~\rm M_{\odot}$ and are in short-period starburst phases.</description>

We present 65 extremely dust-obscured galaxies from the UltraVISTA DR3 survey of the COSMOS field at $1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4$. In contrast to other studies of dusty galaxies, we select our sample based on dust attenuation measured by UV-MIR spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling that allows for extreme attenuation levels. We construct our sample by making cuts at $1 \le z \le 4$, A$V \ge 3$, and log(M$*$/M$_\odot$)$ \ge 10.</description>

To probe the current theory on galaxy formation and evolution, an increased synergy between observations and simulations is necessary. For this reason, in our previous paper of this series, we presented a method to mock SDSS-IV/MaNGA integral-field spectroscopic galaxy observations from cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Here we present the resulting mock galaxy catalogue. This catalogue consists of 1,000 unique galaxies in IllustrisTNG-50 falling into the SDSS-IV/MaNGA-primary target footprint, defined in the redshift and i-band absolute magnitude space.</description>

Local low metallicity dwarf galaxies are relics of the early universe and hold clues into the origins of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In recent work, coronal lines have been used to unveil a population of candidate accreting black holes in dwarf galaxies with gas phase metallicities and stellar masses well below the host galaxies of any previously known AGNs. Using MUSE/VLT observations, we report the detection of [Fe X] $\lambda$6374 coronal line emission and a broad H$\alpha$ line in the nucleus of SDSS J094401.</description>

Cosmic reionization was the last major phase transition of hydrogen from neutral to highly ionized in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Current observations show that the IGM is significantly neutral at $z&amp;gt;7$, and largely ionized by $z\sim5.5$. However, most methods to measure the IGM neutral fraction are highly model-dependent, and are limited to when the volume-averaged neutral fraction of the IGM is either relatively low ($\bar{x}{\rm HI} \lesssim 10^{-3}$) or close to unity ($\bar{x}{\rm HI}\sim 1$).</description>

Explaining the currently observed magnetic fields in galaxies requires relatively strong seeding in the early Universe. One theory proposes that magnetic fields of the order of $\mu$G were expelled by supernova (SN) explosions after primordial, nG or weaker fields were amplified in stellar interiors. In this work, we calculate the maximum magnetic energy that can be injected in the interstellar medium by a stellar cluster of mass $M_{cl}$ based on what is currently known about stellar magnetism.</description>

We develop a pipeline to set new constraints on scale-independent modified gravity, from the galaxy power spectrum in redshift space of BOSS DR12. The latter is modelled using the effective field theory of large-scale structure up to 1-loop order in perturbation theory. We test our pipeline on synthetic and simulated data, to assess systematic biases on the inferred cosmological parameters due to marginalization and theoretical errors, and we apply it to the normal branch of the DGP model with a $\Lambda$CDM background.</description>

In recent years, deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art results in the analysis of point cloud data. In cosmology, galaxy redshift surveys resemble such a permutation invariant collection of positions in space. These surveys have so far mostly been analysed with two-point statistics, such as power spectra and correlation functions. The usage of these summary statistics is best justified on large scales, where the density field is linear and Gaussian.</description>

Models of prestellar cores often assume that the cores are isolated from their environment - material outside the core boundary plays no role in the subsequent evolution. This is unlikely to be the case in reality, where cores are located within hierarchically substructured molecular clouds. We investigate the dynamical and chemical evolution of prestellar cores, modelled as Bonnor-Ebert spheres, and show that the density of the ambient medium has a large impact on the resulting chemical properties of the cores.</description>

One of the most distant galaxies GN-z11 was formed when the Universe was $\le$ 400 Myr old, and it displays a burst-like star formation rate $\sim 25~\msun$ yr$^{-1}$ with a metallicity $Z\sim 0.2\pm 0.1Z_\odot$. It resembles $z=2-3$ galaxies (at ``cosmic noon&amp;quot;) except for the fact that the measured reddening $E(B-V)=0.01\pm 0.01$ indicates the presence of little or no dust. This marked absence of dust hints towards violent dynamical events that destroy or evacuate dust along with gas out of the galaxy on a relatively short time scale and make it transparent.</description>

The measurement of the absolute neutrino mass scale from cosmological large-scale clustering data is one of the key science goals of the Euclid mission.

Here we present the results from a major code comparison effort to establish the maturity and reliability of numerical methods for treating massive neutrinos.</description>

      <description>First author: Isaac Alonso Asensio
We extend the state-of-the-art N-body code PKDGRAV3 with the inclusion of mesh-free gas hydrodynamics for cosmological simulations. Two new hydrodynamic solvers have been implemented, the mesh-less finite volume and mesh-less finite mass methods. The solvers manifestly conserve mass, momentum and energy, and have been validated with a wide range of standard test simulations, including cosmological simulations. We also describe improvements to PKDGRAV3 that have been implemented for performing hydrodynamic simulations.</description>

The demographics of the production and escape of ionizing photons from UV-faint early galaxies is a key unknown in discovering the primary drivers of reionization. With the advent of JWST it is finally possible to observe the rest-frame optical nebular emission from individual sub-L$^*$ z&amp;gt;3 galaxies to measure the production of ionizing photons, $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$. Here we study a sample of 380 z~3-7 galaxies spanning -23 &amp;lt;M$\mathrm{UV}$ &amp;lt; -15.</description>

The first James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) image released was of galaxy cluster SMACSJ0723.3- 7327, a lensing cluster at z=0.39 showing detail only JWST can provide. While the majority of the focus has been on the brilliantly lensed galaxies at redshifts far beyond it, there is more to the story than it being just a lensing cluster. The Chandra X-ray temperature map tells a tale of a merging cluster with a significant subcluster leaving a wake in the intracluster medium (ICM).</description>

      <description>First author: Sergio Contreras
The spatial distribution of galaxies and their gravitational lensing signal offer complementary tests of galaxy formation physics and cosmology. However, their synergy can only be fully exploited if both probes are modelled accurately and consistently. In this paper, we demonstrate that this can be achieved using an extension of Subhalo Abundance Matching, dubbed SHAMe. Specifically, we use mock catalogues built from the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulation to show that SHAMe can simultaneously model the multipoles of the redshift-space galaxy correlation function and galaxy-galaxy lensing, without noticeable bias within the statistical sampling uncertainties of a SDSS volume and on scales r = [0.</description>

Investigating interstellar (IS) dust properties in external galaxies is important not only to infer the intrinsic properties of astronomical objects but also to understand the star/planet formation in the galaxies. From the non-Milky-Way-like extinction and interstellar polarization (ISP) observed in reddened Type~Ia supernovae (SNe), it has been suggested that their host galaxies contain dust grains whose properties are substantially different from the Milky-Way (MW) dust. It is important to investigate the universality of such non-MW-like dust in the universe.</description>

Cosmological N-body simulations of galaxies operate at the level of &amp;ldquo;star particles&amp;rdquo; with a mass resolution on the scale of thousands of solar masses. Turning these simulations into stellar mock catalogs requires &amp;ldquo;upsampling&amp;rdquo; the star particles into individual stars following the same phase-space density. In this paper, we demonstrate that normalizing flows provide a viable upsampling method that greatly improves on conventionally-used kernel smoothing algorithms such as EnBiD.</description>

Modern astronomical observations give unprecedented access to the physical properties of nearby galaxies, including spatially resolved stellar populations. However, observations can only give a present-day view of the Universe, whereas cosmological simulations give access to the past record of the processes that galaxies have experienced in their evolution. To connect the events that happened in the past with galactic properties as seen today, simulations must be taken to a common ground before being compared to observations.</description>

We introduce a new model for the accretion and feedback of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries to the KETJU code, which enables us to resolve the evolution of SMBH binaries down to separations of tens of Schwarzschild radii in gas-rich galaxy mergers. Our subgrid binary accretion model extends the widely used Bondi&amp;ndash;Hoyle&amp;ndash;Lyttleton accretion into the binary phase and incorporates preferential mass accretion onto the secondary SMBH, which is motivated by results from small-scale hydrodynamical circumbinary disc simulations.</description>

A $5^{\circ} \times 7^{\circ}$ sky area containing two large radio structures of G203.1+6.6 and G206.7+5.9 with a size of about 2.5$^{\circ}$ and 3.5$^{\circ}$ respectively is scanned by using the L-band 19-beam receiver of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The FAST L-band receiver covers a frequency range of 1.0 GHz $-$ 1.5 GHz. Commissioning of the receiving system, including the measurements of the half-power beam width, gain, and main-beam efficiency is made by observing the calibrators.</description>

Recent years have seen growing interest in post-processing cosmological simulations with radiative transfer codes to predict observable fluxes for simulated galaxies. However, this can be slow, and requires a number of assumptions in cases where simulations do not resolve the ISM. Zoom-in simulations better resolve the detailed structure of the ISM and the geometry of stars and gas, however statistics are limited due to the computational cost of simulating even a single halo.</description>

Optical spectra of galaxies and quasars from large cosmological surveys are used to measure redshifts and infer distances. They are also rich with information on the intrinsic properties of these astronomical objects. However, their physical interpretation can be challenging due to the substantial number of degrees of freedom, various sources of noise, and degeneracies between physical parameters that cause similar spectral characteristics. To gain deeper insights into these degeneracies, we apply two unsupervised machine learning frameworks to a sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 16 (SDSS DR16).</description>

      <description>First author: Laura Scholz-Diaz
Nearby galaxies are the end result of their cosmological evolution, which is predicted to be influenced by the growth of their host dark matter halos. This co-evolution potentially leaves signatures in present-day observed galaxy properties, which might be essential to further understand how the growth and properties of galaxies are connected to those of their host halos. In this work, we study the evolutionary histories of nearby galaxies both in terms of their host halos and the scatter of the star-forming main sequence by investigating their time-resolved stellar populations using absorption optical spectra drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.</description>

The youngest Galactic supernova remnant G1.9+0.3 shows a discrete feature between its radio and X-ray morphologies. The observed radio morphology features a single maximum in the north, while the X-ray observation shows two opposite &amp;rsquo;ears&amp;rsquo; on the east and west sides. Using 3D magneto hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the formation of the discrete feature of the remnant. We have tested different parameters for better simulation and reproduced similar discrete features under an environment with density gradient and an environment with clump, which provides a possible explanation of the observation.</description>

The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a pivotal role in regulating gas flows around galaxies and thus shapes their evolution. However, the details of how galaxies and their CGM co-evolve remain poorly understood. We present a new time-dependent two-zone model that self-consistently tracks not just mass and metal flows between galaxies and their CGM but also the evolution of the global thermal and turbulent kinetic energy of the CGM.</description>

Tadpole galaxies are metal-poor dwarfs with typically one dominant star-forming region, giving them a head-tail structure when inclined. A metallicity drop in the head suggests that gas accretion with even lower metallicity stimulated the star formation. Here we present multiband HST WFC3 and ACS images of four nearby (&amp;lt;25 Mpc) tadpoles, SBS0, SBS1, Kiso 3867, and UM461, selected for their clear metallicity drops shown in previous spectroscopic studies.</description>

Galaxy formation theories predict that galaxy shapes and angular momenta have intrinsic alignments (IA) with the cosmic web, which provides an observational test of various theories, and is important to quantify as a nuisance parameter for weak lensing. We study galaxy IA in the IllustrisTNG suite of hydrodynamical simulations at redshifts 1 and 2, finding that alignment trends are consistent with previous studies. However, we find that the magnitude of the spin alignment signal is $\sim 2.</description>

We investigate the formation of infant globular cluster (GC) candidates in high-resolution cosmological simulations from the First Billion Years (FiBY) project. By analysing the evolution of the systems in the energy and angular momentum plane, we identify the redshift at which the infant GCs first became gravitationally bound, and we find evidence of radial infall of their gaseous and stellar components. The collapse appears to be driven by internal self-gravity, however, the initial trigger is sourced from the external environment.</description>

      <description>A. Marasco,
Baryonic feedback is expected to play a key role in regulating the star formation of low-mass galaxies by producing galaxy-scale winds associated with mass-loading factors $β\!\sim\!1\!-\!50$. We have tested this prediction using a sample of 19 nearby systems with stellar masses $10^7\!&amp;amp;lt;\!M_\star/{\rm M}_{\odot}\!&amp;amp;lt;\!10^{10}$, mostly lying above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. We used MUSE@VLT optical integral field spectroscopy to study the warm ionised gas kinematics of these galaxies via a detailed modelling of their H$α$ emission line.</description>

      <description>First author: F. Ubertosi
We aim to investigate the AGN/ICM interplay in ZwCl 235, a galaxy cluster with high X-ray flux, an extended central radio galaxy, and evidence of multi-phase gas at its center. Using archival data from the Chandra telescope, the VLASS survey, the LOTSS survey and the VLBA telescope, we perform a complete study of ZwCl 235, dissecting the dynamics of the ICM, the thermodynamic state of the central gas, and the properties of the BCG.</description>

      <description>First author: Andrew M. M. Reeves
We forward-model mass-weighted ages (MWAs) and quiescent fractions in projected phase space (PPS), using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to jointly constrain an infall quenching model for galaxies in $\log(M_{\mathrm{vir}}/\mathrm{M}{\odot})&amp;gt;14$ galaxy clusters at $z\sim 0$. We find the average deviation in MWA from the MWA-$M\star$ relation depends on position in PPS, with a maximum difference between the inner cluster and infalling interloper galaxies of $\sim 1$ Gyr.</description>

With the advent of billion-galaxy surveys with complex data, the need of the hour is to efficiently model galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with robust uncertainty quantification. The combination of Simulation-Based inference (SBI) and amortized Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) has been successfully used to analyse simulated and real galaxy photometry both precisely and efficiently. In this work, we utilise this combination and build on existing literature to analyse simulated noisy galaxy spectra.</description>

      <description>First author: Fabrizio Fiore
The JWST discovery of a number of super-early (redshift $z&amp;gt;10$), blue galaxies requires these systems to be essentially dust-free in spite of their large stellar masses. A possible explanation is that dust is evacuated by radiatively-driven outflows. We test this hypothesis by deriving the Eddington ratio, $\lambda_E$, for 134 galaxies at $6.5&amp;lt; z &amp;lt;16$. We find a strong anti-correlation between $\lambda_E$ and dust UV optical depth, $\tau_{1500} \propto \lambda_E^{-0.</description>

      <description>First author: Takuji Tsujimoto
Massive ($\geq$8 $M_\odot$) stars perish via one of two fates: core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which release synthesized heavy elements, or failed supernovae, thereby forming black holes. In the conventional Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) scheme, a substantial portion of massive stars, e.g., all stars in the mass range of 8-100 $M_{\odot},$ are assumed to enrich the Galaxy with their nucleosynthetic products. However, this hypothesis conflicts with the observations, namely, few CCSNe whose progenitor stars are more massive than $\sim$18 $M_{\odot}.</description>

We present detailed chemical compositions of four stars on the first-ascent red giant branch that are classified as chemically peculiar, but lack comprehensive analyses at high spectral resolution. For BD+03{\deg}2688, HE 0457-1805, HE 1255-2324, and HE 2207-1746, we derived metallicities [Fe/H] $=-1.21$, $-0.19$, $-0.31$, and $-0.55$, respectively, indicating a range in Galactic population membership. In addition to atmospheric parameters, we extracted elemental abundances for 28 elements, including the evolutionary-sensitive CNO group and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios.</description>

Three-body interactions can eject stars from the core of a globular cluster, causing them to enter the Galactic halo as extra-tidal stars. While finding extra-tidal stars is imperative for understanding cluster evolution, connecting isolated extra-tidal field stars back to their birth cluster is extremely difficult. In this work, we present a new methodology consisting of high-dimensional data analysis and a particle spray code to identify extra-tidal stars of any Galactic globular cluster using M3 as a case study.</description>

      <description>First author: Liam Parker
We present a new method which leverages conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) to reconstruct galaxy cluster convergence from lensed CMB temperature maps. Our model is constructed to emphasize structure and high-frequency correctness relative to the Residual U-Net approach presented by Caldeira, et. al. (2019). Ultimately, we demonstrate that while both models perform similarly in the no-noise regime (as well as after random off-centering of the cluster center), cGAN outperforms ResUNet when processing CMB maps noised with 5uK/arcmin white noise or astrophysical foregrounds (tSZ and kSZ); this out-performance is especially pronounced at high l, which is exactly the regime in which the ResUNet under-performs traditional methods.</description>

      <description>First author: Fred Jennings
In galaxy clusters, the hot intracluster medium (ICM) can develop a striking multi-phase structure around the brightest cluster galaxy. Much work has been done on understanding the origin of this central nebula, but less work has studied its eventual fate after the originally filamentary structure is broken into individual cold clumps. In this paper we perform a suite of 30 (magneto-)hydrodynamical simulations of kpc-scale cold clouds with typical parameters as found by galaxy cluster simulations, to understand whether clouds are mixed back into the hot ICM or can persist.</description>

Enshrouded in several well-known controversies, dwarf galaxies have been extensively studied to learn about the underlying cosmology, notwithstanding that physical processes regulating their properties are poorly understood. To shed light on these processes, we introduce the Pandora suite of 17 high-resolution (3.5 parsec half-cell side) dwarf galaxy formation cosmological simulations. Commencing with thermo-turbulent star formation and mechanical supernova feedback, we gradually increase the complexity of physics incorporated leading to full-physics models combining magnetism, on-the-fly radiative transfer and the corresponding stellar photoheating, and SN-accelerated cosmic rays.</description>

We present a high-resolution kinematic study of the massive main-sequence star-forming galaxy (SFG) SDSS J090122.37+181432.3 (J0901) at z=2.259, using 0.36 arcsec ALMA CO(3-2) and 0.1-0.5 arcsec SINFONI/VLT H-alpha observations. J0901 is a rare, strongly-lensed but otherwise normal massive (log(M_star/M_sun)~11) main sequence SFG, offering a unique opportunity to study a typical massive SFG under the microscope of lensing. Through forward dynamical modeling incorporating lensing deflection, we fit the CO and H-alpha kinematics in the image plane out to about one disk effective radius (R_e ~ 4 kpc) at a ~600pc delensed physical resolution along the kinematic major axis.</description>

We show that the Friedmann-Lema^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) framework has an instability towards the growth of fluid flow anisotropies, even if the Universe is accelerating. This flow (tilt) instability in the matter sector is invisible to Cosmic No-Hair Theorem-like arguments, which typically only flag shear anisotropies in the metric. We illustrate our claims in the setting of ``dipole cosmology&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, the maximally Copernican generalization of FLRW that can accommodate a flow.</description>

We introduce the neural network architecture SPENDER as a core differentiable building block for analyzing, representing, and creating galaxy spectra. It combines a convolutional encoder, which pays attention to up to 256 spectral features and compresses them into a low-dimensional latent space, with a decoder that generates a restframe representation, whose spectral range and resolution exceeds that of the observing instrument. The decoder is followed by explicit redshift, resampling, and convolution transformations to match the observations.</description>

We perform a novel multi-messenger analysis for the identification and parameter estimation of the Standing Accretion Shock Instability (SASI) in a core collapse supernova with neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals. In the neutrino channel, this method performs a likelihood ratio test for the presence of SASI in the frequency domain. For gravitational wave signals we process an event with a modified constrained likelihood method. Using simulated supernova signals, the properties of the Hyper-Kamiokande neutrino detector, and O3 LIGO Interferometric data, we produce the two-dimensional probability density distribution (PDF) of the SASI activity indicator and calculate the probability of detection $P_\mathrm{D}$ as well as the false identification probability $P_\mathrm{FI}$.</description>

      <description>T. Miener,
One of the most pressing questions for modern physics is the nature of dark matter (DM). Several efforts have been made to model this elusive kind of matter. The largest fraction of DM cannot be made of any of the known particles of the Standard Model (SM). We focus on brane world theory as a prospective framework for DM candidates beyond the SM of particle physics. The new degrees of freedom that appear in flexible brane world models, corresponding to brane fluctuations, are called branons.</description>

We first discuss and determine the isospin mixing of the two $2^-$ states (12.53 MeV and 12.97 MeV) of $^{16}$O nucleus using the inelastic electron scattering data. We then evaluate the cross section of 4.4-MeV $\gamma$ rays produced in the neutrino neutral-current (NC) reaction $^{16}$O($\nu, \nu^{\prime}$)$^{16}$O$(12.97~{\rm MeV}, 2^-$) in a water Cherenkov detector at the low energy below 100 MeV. The detection of $\gamma$ rays for $E_{\gamma}&amp;gt;5$~MeV from the NC reaction $^{16}$O($\nu, \nu^{\prime}$)$^{16}$O$(E_x&amp;gt;16\ {\rm MeV}, T=1$) with a water Cherenkov detector in the supernova neutrino bursts has been proposed and discussed by several authors previously.</description>

Our 9.7-hour integration is centered upon the $z=6.3$ quasar J0100+2802 &amp;ndash; the first of six fields targeted by the EIGER survey &amp;ndash; and covers $\lambda=3-4$ microns. We detect 133 [OIII] doublets, but merge pairs within $\approx$10 kpc and 600 km s$^{-1}$, motivated by their small scale clustering excess.</description>

      <description>Christopher C. Lovell
Passive galaxies are ubiquitous in the local universe, and various physical channels have been proposed that lead to this passivity. To date, robust passive galaxy candidates have been detected up to $z \leqslant 5$, but it is still unknown if they exist at higher redshifts, what their relative abundances are, and what causes them to stop forming stars. We present predictions from the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a series of zoom simulations of a range of overdensities using the EAGLE code.</description>

      <description>First author: Dominic Smith
Galaxies broadly fall into two categories: star-forming (blue) galaxies and quiescent (red) galaxies. In between, one finds the less populated ``green valley&amp;quot;. Some of these galaxies are suspected to be in the process of ceasing their star-formation through a gradual exhaustion of gas supply or already dead and are experiencing a rejuvenation of star-formation through fuel injection. We use the Galaxy And Mass Assembly database and the Galaxy Zoo citizen science morphological estimates to compare the morphology of galaxies in the green valley against those in the red sequence and blue cloud.</description>

The nonlinear Lagrangian displacement field and initial linear density field are highly correlated. Therefore, reconstructing the nonlinear displacement field could better extract the primordial cosmological information from the late time density field. Continuing from Ref. [1], we investigate to what extent the iterative displacement reconstruction in Ref. [2] can recover the true displacement field with a particular emphasis on improving the numerical discreteness effect and improving the perturbation theory model for the postreconstructed field.</description>

MargNet consists of a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures. Using a carefully curated dataset consisting of 240,000 compact objects and an additional 150,000 faint objects, the machine learns classification directly from the data, minimising the need for human intervention.</description>

      <description>First author: Josh Borrow
All modern galaxy formation models employ stochastic elements in their sub-grid prescriptions to discretise continuous equations across the time domain. In this paper, we investigate how the stochastic nature of these models, notably star formation, black hole accretion, and their associated feedback, that act on small ($&amp;lt;$ kpc) scales, can back-react on macroscopic galaxy properties (e.g. stellar mass and size) across long ($&amp;gt;$ Gyr) timescales. We find that the scatter in scaling relations predicted by the EAGLE model implemented in the SWIFT code can be significantly impacted by random variability between re-simulations of the same object, even when galaxies are resolved by tens of thousands of particles.</description>

Recent observations indicate that galactic outflows are ubiquitous in high redshift galaxies, including normal star forming galaxies, quasar hosts, and dusty star forming galaxies (DSFGs). However, the impact of outflows on the evolution of their hosts is still an open question. Here, we analyse the star formation histories (SFH) and galactic outflow properties of galaxies in massive haloes ($10^{12}M_{\odot}&amp;lt;M_{\rm vir} &amp;lt;5\times 10^{12}M_{\odot}$) at $z\gtrsim5.5$ in three zoom-in cosmological simulations from the MassiveFIRE suite, as part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project.</description>

      <description>First author: Suhail Dhawan
The local distance ladder estimate of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is important in cosmology, given the recent tension with the early universe inference. We estimate $H_0$ from the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) distance ladder, inferring SN Ia distances with the hierarchical Bayesian SED model, BayeSN. This method has a notable advantage of being able to continuously model the optical and near-infrared (NIR) SN Ia light curves simultaneously.</description>

The epoch in which galactic discs settle is a major benchmark to test models of galaxy formation and evolution but is as yet largely unknown. Once discs settle and become self-gravitating enough, stellar bars are able to form; therefore, determining the ages of bars can shed light on the epoch of disc settling, and on the onset of secular evolution. Nevertheless, until now, timing when the bar formed has proven challenging.</description>

In this work, we use ~500 low-redshift (z ~ 0.1) X-ray AGNs observed by XMM-Newton and SDSS to investigate the prevalence and nature of AGNs that apparently lack optical emission lines (optically dull AGNs&#39;&#39;). Although 1/4 of spectra appear absorption-line dominated in visual assessment, line extraction with robust continuum subtraction from the MPA/JHU catalog reveals usable [OIII] measurements in 98% of the sample, allowing us to study [OIII]-underluminous AGNs together with more typical AGNs in the context of the L$_{\mathrm{[OIII]}}$--L$_{X}$ relation.</description>

      <description>Geraint F. Lewis
Based upon a metallicity selection, we identify a significant sub-population of the inner halo globular clusters in the Andromeda Galaxy which we name the Dulais Structure. It is distinguished as a co-rotating group of 10-20 globular clusters which appear to be kinematically distinct from, and on average more metal-poor than, the majority of the inner halo population. Intriguingly, the orbital axis of this Dulais Structure is closely aligned with that of the younger accretion event recently identified using a sub-population of globular clusters in the outer halo of Andromeda, and this is strongly suggestive of a causal relationship between the two.</description>

We present a new diagnostic diagram for local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and quasars, analysing particularly the Spitzer Space Telescope&amp;rsquo;s Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra of 102 local ULIRGs and 37 Palomar Green quasars. Our diagram is based on a special non-linear mapping of these data, employing the Kernel Principal Component Analysis method. The novelty of this map lies in the fact that it distributes the galaxies under study on the surface of a well-defined ellipsoid, which, in turn, links basic concepts from geometry to physical properties of the galaxies.</description>

Galaxies, diffuse gas and dark matter make up the cosmic web defining the large-scale structure of the universe. We constrain the joint distribution of these constituents by cross-correlating galaxy samples binned by stellar mass from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey CMASS catalogue with maps of lensing convergence and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect from the Planck mission. Fitting a halo-based model to our measured angular power spectra (galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-lensing convergence, galaxy-tSZ) at a median redshift of $z=0.</description>

      <description>First author: Susana J. Landau
A discrete space-time structure lying at about the Planck scale may become manifest in the form of very small violations of the conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor. In order to include such kind of violations, forbidden within the General Relativity framework, the theory of unimodular gravity seems as the simplest option to describe the gravitational interaction. In the cosmological context, a direct consequence of such violation of energy conservation might be heuristically viewed a &amp;ldquo;diffusion process of matter (both dark and ordinary)&amp;rdquo; into an effective dark energy term in Einstein&amp;rsquo;s equations, which leads under natural assumptions to an adequate estimate for the value of the cosmological constant.</description>

In this paper we explore the existing tensions in the local cosmological expansion rate, $H_0$, and amplitude of the clustering of large-scale structure at $8\, h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$, $σ_8$, as well as models that claim to alleviate these tensions. We consider seven models: evolving dark energy ($w$CDM), extra radiation ($N_\mathrm{eff}$), massive neutrinos, curvature, primordial magnetic fields (PMF), self-interacting neutrino models, and early dark energy (EDE). We test these models against three data sets that span the full range of measurable cosmological epochs, have significant precision, and are well-tested against systematic effects: the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey baryon acoustic oscillation scale measurements, and the Pantheon catalog of Type Ia supernovae.</description>

Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) in globular clusters are low mass X-ray binaries that achieve high X-ray luminosities through a currently uncertain accretion mechanism. Using archival Chandra and Hubble Space Telescope observations, we perform a volume-limited search ($\lesssim$ 70 Mpc) of 21 of the most massive ($&amp;gt;10^{11.5} M_\odot$) early-type galaxies to identify ULXs hosted by globular cluster (GC) candidates. We find a total of 34 ULX candidates above the expected background within 5 times the effective radius of each galaxy, with 10 of these ($\sim29.</description>

Shocks of supernova remnants (SNRs) accelerate charged particles up to 100 TeV range via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism. It is believed that shocks of SNRs are the main contributors to the pool of Galactic cosmic rays, although it is still under debate whether they can accelerate particles up to the &amp;ldquo;knee&amp;rdquo; energy (10^15.5 eV) or not. In this chapter, we start with introducing SNRs as likely sources of cosmic rays and the radiation mechanisms associated with cosmic rays (section 3).</description>

      <description>First author: Tomáš Šoltinský
Enhanced ionizing radiation in close proximity to redshift $z\gtrsim 6$ quasars creates short windows of intergalactic Ly$\alpha$ transmission blueward of the quasar Ly$\alpha$ emission lines. The majority of these Ly$\alpha$ near-zones are consistent with quasars that have optically/UV bright lifetimes of $t_{\rm Q}\sim 10^{5}-10^{7}\rm,yr$. However, lifetimes as short as $t_{\rm Q}\lesssim 10^{4}\rm,yr$ appear to be required by the smallest Ly$\alpha$ near-zones. These short lifetimes present an apparent challenge for the growth of $\sim 10^{9}\rm,M_{\odot}$ black holes at $z\gtrsim 6$.</description>

Galaxy morphology reflects structural properties which contribute to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies. Deep convolutional networks have proven to be very successful in learning hidden features that allow for unprecedented performance on galaxy morphological classification. Such networks mostly follow the supervised learning paradigm which requires sufficient labelled data for training. However, it is an expensive and complicated process of labeling for million galaxies, particularly for the forthcoming survey projects.</description>

      <description>First author: N. Deg
We present the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) Pilot Phase I HI kinematic models. This first data release consists of HI observations of three fields in the direction of the Hydra and Norma clusters, and the NGC 4636 galaxy group. In this paper, we describe how we generate and publicly release flat-disk tilted-ring kinematic models for 109/592 unique HI detections in these fields.</description>

      <description>First author: Christos Panagiotou
The UV/optical and X-ray variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have long been expected to be well correlated as a result of the X-ray illumination of the accretion disk. Recent monitoring campaigns of nearby AGN, however, found that their X-ray and UV/optical emission are only moderately correlated, challenging the aforementioned paradigm. In this work, we aim to demonstrate that due to the definition of the cross correlation function, a low UV/X-ray correlation is well expected in the case of an X-ray illuminated accretion disk, when the dynamic variability of the X-ray source is taken into account.</description>

      <description>First author: Junzhi Wang
The line widths of broad line regions (BLRs) of AGNs are key parameters for understanding the central super massive black holes (SMBHs). However, due to obscuration from dusty torus, optical recombination lines from BLRs in type II AGNs can not be directly detected. Radio recombination lines (RRLs), with low extinction, can be ideal tracers to probe emission from BLRs in type II AGNs. We performed RRL observations for H35$\alpha$ and H36$\alpha$ toward the center of Circinus galaxy with ALMA.</description>

      <description>First author: Y. -C. Pan
There is growing evidence that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely produced via multiple explosion channels. Understanding how different channels evolve with redshift is critical in determining their precision in measuring cosmological parameters. Previous studies indicated that SN Ia ejecta velocity is one powerful tool to differentiate between different channels. It was also suspected that the tight correlation with the host-galaxy environment could result in the evolution of SN ejecta velocities.</description>

      <description>First author: Joseph Ryan
The planning and design of future experiments rely heavily on forecasting to assess the potential scientific value provided by a hypothetical set of measurements. The Fisher information matrix, due to its convenient properties and low computational cost, provides an especially useful forecasting tool. However, the Fisher matrix only provides a reasonable approximation to the true likelihood when data are nearly Gaussian distributed and observables have nearly linear dependence on the parameters of interest.</description>

      <description>First author: Ngai Pok Kwan
In the light of GPU accelerations, sequential operations such as solving ordinary differential equations can be bottlenecks for gradient evaluations and hinder potential speed gains. In this work, we focus on growth functions and their time derivatives in cosmological particle mesh simulations and show that these are the majority time cost when using gradient based inference algorithms. We propose to construct novel conditional B-spline emulators which directly learn an interpolating function for the growth factor as a function of time, conditioned on the cosmology.</description>

MACS0647$-$JD is a triply-lensed $z\sim11$ galaxy originally discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we report new JWST imaging, which clearly resolves MACS0647$-$JD as having two components that are either merging galaxies or stellar complexes within a single galaxy. Both are very small, with stellar masses $\sim10^8,M_\odot$ and radii $r&amp;lt;100,\rm pc$. The brighter larger component &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; is intrinsically very blue ($β\sim-2.6$), likely due to very recent star formation and no dust, and is spatially extended with an effective radius $\sim70,\rm pc$.</description>

      <description>Alejandro Guzmán-Ortega
Using the TNG50 cosmological simulation and observations from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), we investigate the connection between galaxy mergers and optical morphology in the local Universe over a wide range of galaxy stellar masses ($8.5\leqslant\log(M_\ast/\text{M}\odot)\leqslant11$). To this end, we have generated over 16,000 synthetic images of TNG50 galaxies designed to match KiDS observations, including the effects of dust attenuation and scattering, and used the $\mathrm{\mathtt{statmorph}}$ code to measure various image-based morphological diagnostics in the $r$-band for both data sets.</description>

      <description>Abinash Kumar Shaw
The redshifted 21-cm radiation from the atomic hydrogen (HI) provides an excellent direct probe to study the evolution of HI in IGM and thus reveal the nature of the first luminous objects, their evolution and role during Cosmic Dawn (CD) and Epoch of Reionization (EoR), and formation and evolution of the structures thereafter. Direct mapping of the HI density during the CD-EoR is rather difficult with the current and future instruments due to large foreground and other observational contamination.</description>

We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of the Type Icn supernova (SN Icn) 2022ann, the fifth member of its newly identified class of SNe. Its early optical spectra are dominated by narrow carbon and oxygen P-Cygni features with absorption velocities of 800 km/s; slower than other SNe Icn and indicative of interaction with a dense, H/He-poor circumstellar medium (CSM) that is outflowing slower than a typical Wolf-Rayet wind velocity of $&amp;gt;$1000 km/s.</description>

We conducted a Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observation of the low mass active galactic nucleus (AGN) in galaxy NGC 4293 ($z=0.003$). The object is associated with a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER). Its black hole mass is estimated as $\sim10^5$ or $\sim10^7 M_\odot$. The VLBA 1.5 GHz image shows an inverse symmetric structure with two discrete radio blobs separated by an angular distance of $\sim120$ mas, corresponding to $\sim7$ parsec.</description>

We discuss the mechanism(s) of bar formation in isolated and tidally interacting disk galaxies using the results of idealized collisionless Nbody simulations of the galaxies. In order to better understand the mechanism, we investigate orbital eccentricities (e), epochs of apocenter passages (t_a), azimuthal angles at t_a (varphi_a), precession rates (Omega_pre), for individual stars, as well as bar strengths represented by relative m=2 Fourier amplitude (A_2) and bar pattern speeds (Omega_bar).</description>

Rotation may affect the occurrence of sustainable hydrogen burning in very low-mass stellar objects by the introduction of centrifugal force to the hydrostatic balance as well as by the appearance of rotational break-up of the objects (mass-shedding limit) for rapidly rotating cases. We numerically construct the models of rotating very low-mass stellar objects that may or may not experience sustained nuclear reaction (hydrogen-burning) as their energy source.</description>

A supermassive black hole (SMBH) of $\sim 3\times 10^6 , \rm M_\odot$ was recently detected via dynamical measurements at the center of the dwarf galaxy Leo I. Standing $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude above standard scaling relations, this SMBH is hosted by a galaxy devoid of gas and with no significant star formation in the last $\sim 1$ Gyr. This detection can profoundly impact the formation models for black holes and their hosts.</description>

We present a Bayesian jackknife test for assessing the probability that a data set contains biased subsets, and, if so, which of the subsets are likely to be biased. The test can be used to assess the presence and likely source of statistical tension between different measurements of the same quantities in an automated manner. Under certain broadly applicable assumptions, the test is analytically tractable.</description>

The new capabilities that JWST offers in the near- and mid-infrared (IR) are used to investigate in unprecedented detail the nature of optical/near-IR faint, mid-IR bright sources, the so-called HST-dark galaxies among them. We gather JWST data from the CEERS survey in the EGS, jointly with HST data, to face this task by analyzing spatially resolved optical-to-mid-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to estimate both photometric redshifts and stellar populations properties in two dimensions.</description>

      <description>First author: M. Schmassmann
We analyse a sunspot simulation in an effort to understand the origin of the convective instabilities giving rise to the penumbral and umbral distinct regimes. We applied the criterion from Gough &amp;amp; Tayler (1966), accounting for the stabilising effect of the vertical magnetic field to investigate the convective instabilities in a MURaM sunspot simulation. We find: (1) a highly unstable shallow layer right beneath the surface extending all over the simulation box in which convection is triggered by radiative cooling in the photosphere; (2) a deep umbral core (beneath -5 Mm) stabilised against overturning convection that underlies a region with stable background values permeated by slender instabilities coupled to umbral dots; (3) filamentary instabilities below the penumbra nearly parallel to the surface and undulating instabilities coupled to the penumbra which originate in the deep layers.</description>

We review recent works on the dynamics of circumbinary accretion, including time variability, angular momentum transfer between the disk and the binary, and the secular evolution of accreting binaries. These dynamics can impact stellar binary formation/evolution, circumbinary planet formation/migration, and the evolution of (super)massive black-hole binaries. We discuss the dynamics and evolution of inclined/warped circumbinary disks and connect with recent observations of protoplanetary disks. A special kind of circumbinary accretion involves binaries embedded in &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; disks, which may contribute to the mergers of stellar-mass black holes in AGN disks.</description>

We carry out three dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to study the impact of planet-disc interactions on a gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disc. We find that the impact of a planet on the disc&amp;rsquo;s evolution can be described by three scenarios. If the planet is sufficiently massive, the spiral wakes generated by the planet dominate the evolution of the disc and gravitational instabilities are completely suppressed. If the planet&amp;rsquo;s mass is too small, then gravitational instabilities are unaffected.</description>

This paper explores the role of small-scale environment ($&amp;lt;1$ Mpc) in modulating accretion events onto supermassive black holes by studying the incidence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in massive clusters of galaxies. A flexible, data-driven semi-empirical model is developed based on a minimal set of parameters and under the zero order assumption that the incidence of AGN in galaxies is independent of environment. This is used to predict how the fraction of X-ray selected AGN among galaxies in massive dark matter halos ($\gtrsim 3\times 10^{14},M_{\odot}$) evolves with redshift and reveal tensions with observations.</description>

Cosmic voids are promising cosmological laboratories for studying the dark energy phenomenon and alternative gravity theories. They are receiving special attention nowadays in view of the new generation of galaxy spectroscopic surveys, which are covering an unprecedented volume and redshift range. There are two primary statistics in void studies: (i) the void size function, which characterises the abundance of voids, and (ii) the void-galaxy cross-correlation function, which contains information about the density and velocity fields in these regions.</description>

We present the effective-field theory (EFT)-based cosmological full-shape analysis of the anisotropic power spectrum of eBOSS quasars at the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=1.48$. We perform extensive tests of our pipeline on simulations, paying a particular attention to the modeling of observational systematics, such as redshift smearing, fiber collisions, and the radial integral constraint. Assuming the minimal $\Lambda$CDM model, and fixing the primordial power spectrum tilt and the physical baryon density, we find the Hubble constant $H_0=(66.</description>

We then apply overdensity analysis to the bins using two density estimators, a Weighted Adaptive Kernel Estimator and a Weighted Voronoi Tessellation Estimator.</description>

      <description>First author: B. Biswas
We describe the fast transient classification algorithm in the center of the kilonova (KN) science module currently implemented in the Fink broker and report classification results based on simulated catalogs and real data from the ZTF alert stream. We used noiseless, homogeneously sampled simulations to construct a basis of principal components (PCs). All light curves from a more realistic ZTF simulation were written as a linear combination of this basis.</description>

      <description>First author: Enrique Lopez-Rodriguez
Mergers are thought to be a fundamental channel for galaxy growth, perturbing the gas dynamics and the magnetic fields (B-fields) in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the mechanisms that amplify and dissipate B-fields during a merger remain unclear. We characterize the morphology of the ordered B-fields in the multi-phase ISM of the closest merger of two spiral galaxies, the Antennae galaxies. We compare the inferred B-fields using $154~\mu$m thermal dust and $11$ cm radio synchrotron emission polarimetric observations.</description>

Extreme tidal disruption events (eTDEs), which occur when a star passes very close to a supermassive black hole, may provide a way to observe a long-sought general relativistic effect: orbits that wind several times around a black hole and then leave. Through general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, we show that such eTDEs are easily distinguished from most tidal disruptions, in which stars come close, but not so close, to the black hole.</description>

We use the most recent data release (DR9) of the DESI legacy imaging survey and SDSS galaxy groups to measure the conditional luminosity function (CLF) for groups with halo mass $M_{\rm h}\ge 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ and redshift $0.01\le z\le 0.08$, down to a limiting $r$-band magnitude of $M_{\rm r}=-10\sim-12$. For a given halo mass we measure the CLF for the total satellite population, as well as separately for the red and blue populations classified using the $(g-z)$ color.</description>

We present deep Chandra observations of the pre-merger galaxy cluster Abell 98. Abell 98 is a complex merging system. While the northern (A98N) and central subclusters (A98S) are merging along the north-south direction, A98S is undergoing a separate late-stage merger, with two distinct X-ray cores. We report detection of gas sloshing spirals in A98N and in the eastern core of A98S. We detect two cold front edges in A98N.</description>

Solar flares are some of the most energetic events in the solar system and can be studied to investigate the physics of plasmas and stellar processes. One interesting aspect of solar flares is the presence of accelerated (nonthermal) particles, whose signatures appear in solar flare hard X-ray emissions. Debate has been ongoing since the early days of the space age as to how these particles are accelerated, and one way to probe relevant acceleration mechanisms is by investigating short-timescale (tens of milliseconds) variations in solar flare hard X-ray flux.</description>

Sheth-Tormen mass function has been widely used to quantify the abundance of dark matter halos. It is a significant improvement over the Press-Schechter mass function as it uses ellipsoidal collapse in place of spherical collapse. Both of these mass functions can be written in a form that is universal, i.e., independent of cosmology and power spectrum when scaled in suitable variables. However, cosmological simulations have shown that this universality is approximate.</description>

At least one major merger is currently taking place in the MW. The Sgr dwarf spheroidal galaxy is being tidally destroyed while orbiting around the MW, whose close passages perturb the MW disc externally. In this work, using a series of hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate how massive dwarf galaxies on quasi-polar Sgr-like orbits impact the star formation activity inside the MW-like discs. First, we confirm that interactions with orbiting satellites enhance the star formation rate in the host galaxy.</description>

Gravitational collapse of dark matter overdensities leads to the formation of dark matter halos which embed galaxies and galaxy clusters. An intriguing feature of dark matter halos is that their density profiles closely follow a universal form irrespective of the initial condition or the corresponding growth history. This represents a class of dynamical systems with emergent universalities. We propose an iterative mean-field approach&#39;&#39; to compute the solutions of the gravitational collapse dynamics.</description>

We report the detection of magnesium dicarbide, MgC$_2$, in the laboratory at centimeter wavelengths and assign $^{24}$MgC$_2$, $^{25}$MgC$_2$, and $^{26}$MgC$_2$ to 14 unidentified lines in the radio spectrum of the circumstellar envelope of the evolved carbon star IRC+10216. The structure of MgC$_2$ is found to be T-shaped with a highly ionic bond between the metal atom and the C$_2$ unit, analogous to other dicarbides containing electropositive elements.</description>

The motion of cosmic strings in the universe leads to the generation of wakes behind them. We study magnetized wakes of cosmic strings moving in the post recombination plasma. We show that magnetic reconnection can occur in the post shock region. Since the width of the cosmic string wake is very small, the reconnection occurs over a very short lengthscale. The reconnection leads to a large amount of kinetic energy being released in the post shock region of the cosmic string wake.</description>

      <description>First author: André Oliva
Like their lower mass siblings, massive protostars can be expected to: a) be surrounded by circumstellar disks and b) launch magnetically-driven jets and outflows. The disk formation and global evolution is thereby controlled by advection of angular momentum from large scales, the efficiency of magnetic braking and the resistivity of the medium, and the internal thermal and magnetic pressures of the disk. We perform a series of 30 simulations of a massive star forming from the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud threaded by an initially-uniform magnetic field, starting from different values for the mass of the cloud, its initial density and rotation profiles, its rotational energy content, the magnetic field strength, and the resistivity of the material.</description>

Quasar-galaxy pairs at small separations are important probes of gas flows in the disk-halo interface in galaxies. We study host galaxies of 198 MgII absorbers at $0.39\le z_{abs}\le1.05$ that show detectable nebular emission lines in the SDSS spectra. We report measurements of impact parameter (5.9$\le D[kpc]\le$16.9) and absolute B-band magnitude ($-18.7\le {\rm M_B}\le -22.3$ mag) of host galaxies of 74 of these absorbers using multi-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey, more than doubling the number of known host galaxies with $D\le17$ kpc.</description>

It is extremely difficult to simulate the details of coronal heating and also make meaningful predictions of the emitted radiation. Thus, testing realistic models with observations is a major challenge. Observational signatures of coronal heating depend crucially on radiation, thermal conduction, and the exchange of mass and energy with the transition region and chromosphere below. Many magnetohydrodynamic simulation studies do not include these effects, opting instead to devote computational resources to the magnetic aspects of the problem.</description>

Machine learning (ML) models can greatly improve the search for strong gravitational lenses in imaging surveys by reducing the amount of human inspection required. In this work, we test the performance of supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning algorithms trained with the ResNetV2 neural network architecture on their ability to efficiently find strong gravitational lenses in the Deep Lens Survey (DLS). We use galaxy images from the survey, combined with simulated lensed sources, as labeled data in our training datasets.</description>

Observational searches for intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $10^2 - 10^6$ $M_\odot$) include relatively isolated dwarf galaxies. For those that host active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the IMBH nature may be discerned through the accretion - jet activity. We present radio observations of four AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies (which potentially harbor IMBHs). Very large array (VLA) observations indicate steep spectra (indices of $-$0.63 to $-$1.05) between 1.4 and 9 GHz.</description>

We analyse the quenched fractions, gas content, and star formation histories of ~1200 satellite galaxies with M* &amp;gt;= 5x10^6 Msun around 198 Milky Way- (MW) and Andromeda-like (M31) hosts in TNG50, the highest-resolution run of the IllustrisTNG simulations. Satellites exhibit larger quenched fractions for smaller masses, at smaller distances to their host galaxy, and in the more massive M31-like compared to MW-like hosts. As satellites cross their host&amp;rsquo;s virial radius, their gas content drops significantly: most satellites within 300 kpc do not contain any detectable gas reservoirs at z=0, unless they are massive like the Magellanic Clouds and M32.</description>

      <description>First author: Michael Ray
Both long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are expected to occur in the dense environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. As these bursts propagate through the disks they live in, they photoionize the medium causing time-dependent opacity that results in transients with unique spectral evolution. In this paper we use a line-of-sight radiation transfer code coupling metal and dust evolution to simulate the time-dependent absorption that occurs in the case of both long and short GRBs.</description>

The neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) mass function (HIMF) describes the distribution of the HI content of galaxies at any epoch; its evolution provides an important probe of models of galaxy formation and evolution. Here, we report Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope HI 21cm spectroscopy of blue star-forming galaxies at $z\approx0.20-0.42$ in the Extended Groth Strip, which has allowed us to determine the scaling relation between the average HI mass ($\rm{M_{HI}}$) and the absolute B-band magnitude ($\rm{M_B}$) of such galaxies at $z \approx 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Diego Sotillo-Ramos
We analyze the merger and assembly histories of Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31)-like galaxies to quantify how, and how often, disk galaxies of this mass can survive recent major mergers (stellar mass ratio $\ge$ 1:4). For this, we use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 and identify 198 analog galaxies, selected based on their $z=0$ stellar mass ($10^{10.5-11.2} {\rm M_{\odot}}$), disky stellar morphology and local environment.</description>

With a unique set of 54 overlapping narrow-band and two broader filters covering the entire optical range, the incoming Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) will provide a great opportunity for stellar physics and near-field cosmology. In this work, we use the miniJPAS data in 56 J-PAS filters and 4 complementary SDSS-like filters to explore and prove the potential of the J-PAS filter system in characterizing stars and deriving their atmospheric parameters.</description>

The James Webb Space Telescope&amp;rsquo;s Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (JWST-NIRISS) flies a 7-hole non-redundant mask (NRM), the first such interferometer in space, operating at 3-5 \micron~wavelengths, and a bright limit of $\simeq 4$ magnitudes in W2. We describe the NIRISS Aperture Masking Interferometry (AMI) mode to help potential observers understand its underlying principles, present some sample science cases, explain its operational observing strategies, indicate how AMI proposals can be developed with data simulations, and how AMI data can be analyzed.</description>

Feeding with gas in streams is predicted to be an important galaxy growth mechanism. Using an idealised setup, we study the impact of stream feeding (with 10$^7$ M${\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ rate) on the star formation and outflows of disc galaxies with $\sim$10$^{11}$ M${\odot}$ baryonic mass. The magneto-hydrodynamical simulations are carried out with the PIERNIK code and include star formation, feedback from supernova, and cosmic ray advection and diffusion.</description>

We present a new planetary global circulation model, planetMPAS, based on the state-of-the-art NCAR MPAS General Circulation Model. Taking advantage of the cross compatibility between WRF and MPAS, planetMPAS includes most of the planetWRF physics parameterization schemes for terrestrial planets such as Mars and Titan. PlanetMPAS also includes a set of physics that represents radiative transfer, dry convection, moist convection and its associated microphysics for the Jovian atmosphere.</description>

We analyse the location of extremely metal-poor stars (EMPs, [Fe/H]$ &amp;lt; -3$) in 198 Milky Way (MW)/M31-like galaxies at $z=0$ in the TNG50 simulation. Each system is divided into four kinematically-defined morphological stellar components based on stellar circularity and galactocentric distance, namely bulge, cold disk, warm disk, and stellar halo, in addition to satellites (with stellar mass $\ge 5\times10^6,M_\odot$). According to TNG50 and across all simulated systems, the stellar halo of the main galaxy and satellites present the highest frequency of EMPs (largest $M_{\mathrm{EMP, comp}}$-to-$M_{\mathrm{tot, comp}}$ stellar mass ratio), and thus the highest chances of finding them.</description>

      <description>First author: Juri Smirnov
Recent surveys have discovered a population of faint supernovae, known as Ca-rich gap transients, inferred to originate from explosive ignitions of white dwarfs. In addition to their unique spectra and luminosities, these supernovae have an unusual spatial distribution and are predominantly found at large distances from their presumed host galaxies. We show that the locations of Ca-rich gap transients are well matched to the distribution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies surrounding large galaxies, in accordance with a scenario where dark matter interactions induce thermonuclear explosions among low-mass white dwarfs that may be otherwise difficult to ignite with standard stellar or binary evolution mechanisms.</description>

[Abridged] This review paper discussed which chemical effects may be at play in a planet-forming disk midplane, which effects are relevant under different conditions, and which tools are available for modelling chemical kinetics in a disk midplane. The review goes on to discuss some important efforts in the planet formation modelling community to treat chemical evolution, and, vice versa, efforts in the chemical modelling community to implement more physical effects related to planet formation into the chemical modelling.</description>

The free-free absorption of low frequency radio waves by thermal electrons in the warm ionized medium of our Galaxy becomes very significant at $\lesssim 10$ MHz (ultralong-wavelength), and the absorption strength depends on the radio frequency. Upcoming space experiments such as the Discovering Sky at the Longest wavelength (DSL) and Farside Array for Radio Science Investigations of the Dark ages and Exoplanets (FARSIDE) will produce high-resolution multi-frequency sky maps at the ultralong-wavelength, providing a new window to observe the Universe.</description>

      <description>First author: Ji-Hoon Ha
Cosmology models predict that external accretion shocks form in the outer region of galaxy clusters due to supersonic gas infall from filaments and voids in the cosmic web. They are characterized by high sonic and Alfv&#39;enic Mach numbers, $M_s\sim10-10^2$ and $M_A\sim10^2-10^3$, and propagate into weakly magnetized plasmas of $\beta\equiv P_g/P_B\gtrsim10^2$. Although strong accretion shocks are expected to be efficient accelerators of cosmic rays (CRs), nonthermal signatures of shock-accelerated CRs around clusters have not been confirmed, and detailed acceleration physics at such shocks has yet to be understood.</description>

Observations of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems have enabled unique tests of nonlinear departures from general relativity (GR) on the galactic and supergalactic scales. One of the most important cases of such tests is constraints on the gravitational slip between two scalar gravitational potentials. In this paper, we use a newly compiled sample of strong gravitational lenses to test the validity of GR, focusing on the screening effects on the apparent positions of lensed sources relative to the GR predictions.</description>

We report the discovery of two companion sources to a strongly lensed galaxy SPT0418-47 (&amp;ldquo;ring&amp;rdquo;) at redshift 4.225, targeted by the JWST Early Release Science program. We confirm that these sources are at a similar redshift as the ring based on H$\alpha$ detected in the NIRSpec spectrum, and $[C II]$ 158 $\mu$m line from ALMA. Using multiple spectral lines detected in JWST/NIRSpec, the rest-frame optical to infrared images from NIRCam and MIRI, and far-infrared (FIR) dust continuum detected by ALMA, we argue that the newly discovered sources are actually lensed images of the same companion galaxy, hereafter referred to as SPT0418-SE (&amp;ldquo;SE&amp;rdquo;), located within 5 kpc in the source plane of the ring.</description>

The low-redshift mass-metallicity relation (MZR) is well studied, but the high-redshift MZR remains difficult to observe. To study the early MZR further, we analyze the Cosmic Reionization on Computers (CROC) simulations with a focus on the MZR from redshifts 5 to 10. We find that, across all redshifts, CROC galaxies exhibit similar stellar-phase and gas-phase MZRs that flatten with higher stellar mass. We attribute this flattening to the inaccurate star formation and feedback modeling in CROC (star formation is overly suppressed in massive CROC galaxies).</description>

The fluctuations in the dark matter-baryon relative velocity field are imprinted as acoustic oscillations in the 21-cm power spectrum during cosmic dawn (CD). These velocity acoustic oscillations (VAOs) keep the imprints of the comoving sound horizon scale. In a previous work by Mu~noz, it has been demonstrated that these VAOs can be treated as standard rulers to measure the cosmic expansion rate at high redshifts by considering a variety of Lyman-Werner feedback strengths and foreground contamination scenarios.</description>

Supernovae and their remnants provide energetic feedback to the ambient interstellar medium (ISM), which is often distributed in multiple gas phases. Among them, warm molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) often dominates the cooling of the shocked molecular ISM, which has been observed with the H$_2$ emission lines at near-infrared wavelengths. Such studies, however, were either limited in narrow filter imaging or sparsely sampled mid-infrared spectroscopic observations with relatively poor angular resolutions.</description>

White-light stellar flares are now reported by the thousands in long-baseline, high precision, broad-band photometry from missions like Kepler, K2, and TESS. These observations are crucial inputs for assessments of biosignatures in exoplanetary atmospheres and surface ultraviolet radiation dosages for habitable zone planets around low-mass stars. A limitation of these assessments, however, is the lack of near-ultraviolet spectral observations of stellar flares. To motivate further empirical investigation, we use a grid of radiative-hydrodynamic simulations with an updated treatment of the pressure broadening of hydrogen lines to predict the $\lambda \approx 1800-3300$ \AA</description>

We demonstrate using linear theory and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations that a synchrotron-cooling collisionless plasma acquires pressure anisotropy and, if the plasma beta is sufficiently high, becomes unstable to the firehose instability, in a process that we dub the synchrotron firehose instability (SFHI). The SFHI channels free energy from the pressure anisotropy of the radiating, relativistic electrons (and/or positrons) into small-amplitude, kinetic-scale magnetic-field fluctuations, which pitch-angle scatter the particles and bring the plasma to a near-thermal state of marginal instability.</description>

We observed the scintillation pattern of nine bright pulsars at 324 MHz and three at 1.68 GHz and analyzed the wavenumber spectrum which is related to electron density variations of the plasma turbulence of the interstellar medium. For all pulsars the frequency section of the autocorrelation function of the dynamic spectra to at least 45% of the maximum corresponds to predictions of scattering theories with a range of power-law exponents of the wavenumber spectrum of $3.</description>

These surveys are the most sensitive low-frequency widefield surveys to date, allowing us to select low-luminosity PS sources. Our sample increases the number of known PS sources in our survey area by a factor 50.</description>

The intermediate mass black hole range, $10\lesssim M_{\rm BH}^{}/M_\odot^{}\lesssim 10^{5} $, has long offered enticing possibilities for primordial black holes (PBH), with populations in this range postulated to be responsible for some of the LIGO binary merger detected events as well as the existence of supermassive black holes embedded at galactic centers. However, a prominent bound derived from PBH accretion during recombination severely restricts the mass fraction of intermediate mass PBH.</description>

      <description>First author: Di Wen
We examine the flux density ratio anomaly in the quadruply-imaged strong gravitational lens, B1422+231, and consider the contribution of $10-10^3M_{\odot}$ primordial black holes (PBHs) as a potential dark matter constituent. We describe the first flux density ratio measurement of B1422+231 in the millimeter-wave band using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). This fills an important multi-wavelength gap in our knowledge of this key lensed system. The flux density of the quasar at 233 GHz is dominated by synchrotron emission and the source size is estimated to be 66.</description>

      <description>First author: Anthony J. Pahl
The connection between the escape fraction of ionizing radiation ($f_{esc}$) and the properties of galaxies, such as stellar mass (M*), age, star-formation rate (SFR), and dust content, are key inputs for reionization models, but many of these relationships remain untested at high redshift. We present an analysis of a sample of 96 z~3 galaxies from the Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic Survey (KLCS). These galaxies have both sensitive Keck/LRIS spectroscopic measurements of the Lyman continuum (LyC) region, and multi-band photometry that places constraints on stellar population parameters.</description>

We present the discovery of a new optical/X-ray source likely associated with the Fermi $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL J1408.6-2917. Its high-amplitude periodic optical variability, large spectroscopic radial velocity semi-amplitude, evidence for optical emission lines and flaring, and X-ray properties together imply the source is probably a new black widow millisecond pulsar binary. We compile the properties of the 41 confirmed and suspected field black widows, finding a median secondary mass of $0.</description>

Following our previous study of Artificial Intelligence Assisted Inversion (AIAI) of supernova analyses \citep{Xingzhuo2020AIAI}, we trained a set of deep neural networks based on the one-dimensional radiative transfer code TARDIS \citep{tardis} to simulate the optical spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) between 10 and 40 days after the explosion. The neural network can be applied to derive the elemental abundances from the observed spectra. In this paper, we focus on the mass of $^{56}$Ni and its associated spectral features for a sample of 153 well-observed SNe~Ia.</description>

Could new physics break the mirror symmetry of the Universe? Utilizing recent measurements of the parity-odd four-point correlation function of BOSS galaxies, we probe the physics of inflation by placing constraints on the amplitude of a number of parity-violating models. Within canonical models of (single-field, slow-roll) inflation, no parity-asymmetry can occur; however, it has recently been shown that breaking of the standard assumptions can lead to parity violation within the Effective Field Theory of Inflation (EFTI).</description>

Primordial black holes (PBHs) can be not only cold dark matter candidates but also progenitors of binary black holes observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration. The PBH mass can be shifted to the heavy distribution if multi-merger processes occur. In this work, we constrain the merger history of PBH binaries using the gravitational wave events from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). Considering four commonly used PBH mass functions, namely the log-normal, power-law, broken power-law, and critical collapse forms, we find that the multi-merger processes make a subdominant contribution to the total merger rate.</description>

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo Interferometer Collaborations have now detected all three classes of compact binary mergers: binary black hole (BBH), binary neutron star (BNS), and neutron star-black hole (NSBH). For coalescences involving neutron stars, the simultaneous observation of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation produced by an event, has broader potential to enhance our understanding of these events, and also to probe the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter.</description>

Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) offers the potential to mitigate some of the discrepancies between simulated cold dark matter (CDM) and observed galactic properties. We introduce a physically motivated SIDM model to understand the effects of self interactions on the properties of Milky Way and dwarf galaxy sized haloes. This model consists of dark matter with a nearly degenerate excited state, which allows for both elastic and inelastic scattering.</description>

The discovery of a non-thermal radio ring of low surface brightness about one degree in diameter has been recently reported around the location in the sky of the Calvera pulsar, at a high Galactic latitude. The radio properties point to it likely being a new supernova remnant (SNR), G118.4+37.0. We report an analysis of almost 14 years of observations of this region by the gamma-ray Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi satellite.</description>

Shell galaxies make a class of tidally distorted galaxies, characterised by wide concentric arc(s), extending out to large galactocentric distances with sharp outer edges. Recent observations of young massive star clusters in the prominent outer shell of NGC 474 suggest that such systems host extreme conditions of star formation. In this paper, we present a hydrodynamic simulation of a galaxy merger and its transformation into a shell galaxy.</description>

Transit and radial-velocity surveys over the past two decades have uncovered a significant population of short-period exoplanets. Among them are hot Jupiters, which are gas giant planets with orbital periods of a few days and found in 0.1-1% of Sun-like stars. Hot Jupiters are expected to be engulfed during their host star&amp;rsquo;s radial expansion on the red giant branch. Planetary engulfment has been studied extensively as it may account for observed rapidly rotating and chemically enriched giant stars.</description>

With MaNGA integral field spectroscopy, we present a resolved analysis of star formation for 29 jellyfish galaxies in nearby clusters, identified from radio continuum imaging taken by the Low Frequency Array. Simulations predict enhanced star formation on the &amp;ldquo;leading half&amp;rdquo; of galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping, and in this work we report observational evidence for this elevated star formation. The dividing line (through the galaxy center) that maximizes this star formation enhancement is systematically tied to the observed direction of the ram pressure stripped tail, suggesting a physical connection between ram pressure and this star formation enhancement.</description>

NGC 4472 is home to five ultraluminous X-ray sources hosted by globular clusters. These sources have been suggested as good black hole candidates in extragalactic globular clusters$-$ a highly sought after population that may provide observational information regarding the progenitors of merging black hole binaries. In this body of work, we present X-ray and optical follow up to one of these sources, CXOUJ1229410+075744 (GCU1). We find no evidence of [OIII] optical emission in GCU1 which indicates a lack of significant evidence for super-Eddington outflows, unlike what is seen in a handful of ULXs in extragalactic GCs.</description>

Detecting cosmological signals from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) requires high-precision calibration to isolate the cosmological signals from foreground emission. In radio interferometery, perturbed primary beams of antenna elements can disrupt the precise calibration, which results in contaminating the foreground-free region, or the EoR window, in the cylindrically averaged power spectrum. For Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), we simulate and characterize the perturbed primary beams induced by feed motions such as axial, lateral, and tilting motions, above the 14-meter dish.</description>

It allows one to simulate temperature distributions as well as images and spectral energy distributions of the scattered light and thermal reemission radiation for variable illuminating and heating sources embedded in dust distributions, such as circumstellar disks and dust shells on time scales up to weeks. Methods. We extended the publicly available 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code POLARIS with efficient methods for the simulation of temperature distributions, scattering, and thermal reemission of dust distributions illuminated by temporally variable radiation sources.</description>

Outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are considered a promising candidate for driving AGN feedback at large scales. However, without information on the density of these outflows, we cannot determine how much kinetic power they are imparting to the surrounding medium. Monitoring the response of the ionisation state of the absorbing outflows to changes in the ionising continuum provides the recombination timescale of the outflow, which is a function of the electron density.</description>

The appearance of galaxies over the first billion years after the Big Bang is believed to be responsible for the last dramatic change in the state of the Universe. Ultraviolet photons from galaxies within this time period - the Epoch of Reionization - ionized intergalactic Hydrogen, rendering the Universe transparent to UV radiation and ending the so-called cosmic Dark Ages, sometime after redshift $z\sim8$. The majority of ionizing photons in the first few hundred Myrs of cosmic history are thought to derive from galaxies significantly fainter than the characteristic luminosity $L^{}$.</description>

An interesting feature in active galactic nuclei (AGN) accreting at low rate is the weakness of the reflection features in their X-ray spectra, which can result from the gradual disappearance of the torus with decreasing accretion rates. It has been suggested that low luminosity AGN (LLAGN) would have a different reflector configuration compared with high luminosity AGN, either covering a smaller fraction of the sky or simply having less material.</description>

In this Letter, we show that the nonthermal nature of dark matter freeze-in production leads to large, totally correlated dark matter-photon isocurvature perturbations, which are imprinted in anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Isocurvature is typically expected from inflationary physics, but the isocurvature from freeze-in arises post inflation. We compute the freeze-in of millicharged dark matter, generated from electron-positron annihilations in the early Universe. We find that current CMB observations from \textit{Planck} exclude this scenario for dark matter masses between 1 MeV and 10 GeV at more than $2\sigma$, whereas upcoming CMB experiments will have the sensitivity to reach at least the $4\sigma$ level.</description>

      <description>First author: Daniel Ceverino
The evolution of star-forming galaxies at high redshifts is very sensitive to the strength and nature of stellar feedback. Using two sets of cosmological, zoom-in simulations from the VELA suite, we compare the effects of two different models of feedback: with and without kinetic feedback. At a fixed halo mass and redshift, the stellar mass is reduced by a factor of 1-3 in the models with stronger feedback, so the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation is in better agreement with abundance matching results.</description>

      <description>First author: João Rino-Silvestre
Dust is a major component of the interstellar medium. Through scattering, absorption and thermal re-emission, it can profoundly alter astrophysical observations. Models for dust composition and distribution are necessary to better understand and curb their impact on observations. A new approach for serial and computationally inexpensive production of such models is here presented. Traditionally these models are studied with the help of radiative transfer modelling, a critical tool to understand the impact of dust attenuation and reddening on the observed properties of galaxies and active galactic nuclei.</description>

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory&amp;rsquo;s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will discover an unprecedented number of supernovae (SNe), making spectroscopic classification for all the events infeasible. LSST will thus rely on photometric classification, whose accuracy depends on the not-yet-finalized LSST observing strategy. In this work, we analyze the impact of cadence choices on classification performance using simulated multi-band light curves. First, we simulate SNe with an LSST baseline cadence, a non-rolling cadence, and a presto-color cadence which observes each sky location three times per night instead of twice.</description>

Alongside the recent increase in discoveries of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have come an increasing number of ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs). These ANTs are characterized by hot blackbody-like UV/optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and smooth photometric evolution, often with hard powerlaw-like X-ray emission. ANTs are likely exotic TDEs or smooth flares originating in otherwise narrow-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While their emission in the UV/optical and X-ray has been relatively well-explored, their infrared (IR) emission has not been studied in detail.</description>

We investigate the properties of globular clusters in a galaxy cluster, using the particle tagging method with a semi-analytical approach in a cosmological context. We assume globular clusters form from dark matter halo mergers and their metallicity is assigned based on the stellar mass of the host dark matter halos and the formation redshift of GCs. Dynamical evolution and disruption of globular clusters are considered using semi-analytical approaches, controlled by several free parameters.</description>

In this work, we want to exploit the magnification bias of the SMGs using two different foreground samples, quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and galaxies. Our aim is to study and compare their mass density profiles and estimate their masses and concentrations. The background SMG sample consists of objects observed by \textit{Herschel} with 1.2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4.0. The foreground samples are QSOs and massive galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between 0.2 and 1.</description>

The new generation of telescopes will provide new insight into how the magnetic field arrives into the chromosphere and its role in the energy balance of the solar atmosphere.

In this paper, we formulate a generalised photon Boltzmann hierarchy that allows us to model the evolution and creation of spectral distortion anisotropies in the early Universe. We directly build on our first paper in this series, extending the thermalisation Green&amp;rsquo;s function treatment to the anisotropic case. We show that the problem can be described with the common Boltzmann hierarchy for the photon field extended by new spectral parameters &amp;ndash; a step that reduces the complexity of the calculation by at least two orders of magnitude.</description>

To pinpoint the peak location of the synchrotron total intensity emission in a spiral arm, we use a map of the spiralarm locations (from the observed arm tangent). Thus In a typical spiral arm in Galactic Quadrant I, we find the peak of the synchrotron radiation to be located about 220 +/-40 pc away from the inner arm edge (hot dust lane) inside the spiral arm.</description>

In agreement with the constantly increasing gravitational wave events, new aspects of the internal structure of compact stars can be considered. A scenario in which a first order transition takes place inside these stars is of particular interest as it can lead, under conditions, to a third gravitationally stable branch (besides white dwarfs and neutron stars), the twin stars. The new branch yields stars with the same mass as normal compact stars but quite different radii.</description>

Following point-spread function subtraction, we identify the earliest LE emission associated with a SN at only $+$34 days (d) past the epoch of $B$-band maximum. Additional HST images extending through $+$578 d cover the evolution of LE1 taking the form of a ring, while images taken on $+$1991 d reveals not only LE1, but also segments of a new inner LE ring (LE2) as well as two additional outer LE rings (LE3 &amp;amp; LE4).</description>

The solar active region NOAA 12887 produced a strong X1.0 flare on 2021 October 28, which exhibits X-shaped flare ribbons and a circle-shaped erupting filament. To understand the eruption process with these characteristics, we conducted a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamics simulation using a nonlinear force-free field of the active region about an hour before the flare as the initial condition. Our simulation reproduces the filament eruption observed in the Ha images of GONG and the 304 angstrom images of SDO/AIA and suggests that two mechanisms can possibly contribute to the magnetic eruption.</description>

In order to understand which mechanism is responsible for accretion in protoplanetary discs, a robust knowledge of the observed disc radius using gas tracers such as $^{12}$CO and other CO isotopologues is pivotal. Indeed, the two main theories proposed, viscous accretion and wind-driven accretion, predict different time evolution for the disc radii. In this Letter, we present an analytical solution for the evolution of the disc radii in viscously evolving protoplanetary discs using $^{12}$CO as a tracer, under the assumption that the $^{12}$CO radius is the radius where the surface density of the disc is equal to the threshold for CO photo-dissociation.</description>

We introduce a novel unbiased, cross-correlation estimator for the one-point statistics of cosmological random fields. One-point statistics are a useful tool for analysis of highly non-Gaussian density fields, while cross-correlations provide a powerful method for combining information from pairs of fields and separating them from noise and systematics. We derive a new Deconvolved Distribution Estimator that combines the useful properties of these two methods into one statistic.</description>

Cosmic variance limits the accuracy of cosmological N-body simulations, introducing bias in statistics such as the power spectrum, halo mass function, or the cosmic shear. We provide new methods to measure and reduce the effect of cosmic variance in existing and new simulations. We run pairs of simulations using phase shifted initial conditions with matching amplitudes. We set the initial amplitudes of the Fourier modes to ensure that the average power spectrum of the pair is equal to the cosmic mean power spectrum from linear theory.</description>

      <description>First author: Nondh Panithanpaisal
Recent studies have suggested that the Milky Way (MW)&amp;rsquo;s Dark Matter (DM) halo may be significantly tilted with respect to its central stellar disk, a feature that might be linked to its formation history. In this work, we demonstrate a method of constraining the orientation of the minor axis of the DM halo using the angle and frequency variables. This method is complementary to other traditional techniques, such as orbit fitting.</description>

We present cosmological results inferred from the effective-field theory (EFT) analysis of the full-shape of eBOSS quasars (QSO) power spectrum. We validate our analysis pipeline against simulations, and find overall good agreement between the analyses in Fourier and configuration space. Keeping the baryon abundance and the spectral tilt fixed, we reconstruct at $68%$ CL the fractional matter abundance $\Omega_m$, the reduced Hubble constant $h$, and the clustering amplitude $\sigma_8$, to respectively $\Omega_m=0.</description>

Galaxies often contain large reservoirs of molecular gas which shape their evolution. This can be through cooling of the gas &amp;ndash; which leads to star formation, or accretion onto the central supermassive black hole &amp;ndash; which fuels AGN activity and produces powerful feedback. Molecular gas has been detected in early-type galaxies on scales of just a few tens to hundreds of solar masses by searching for absorption against their compact radio cores.</description>

We investigate archival Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC F140LP observations of NGC~1399 to search for evidence of multiple stellar populations in extragalactic globular clusters. Enhanced FUV populations are thought to be indicators of He-enhanced second generation populations in globular clusters, specifically extreme/blue horizontal branch stars. Out of 149 globular clusters in the field of view, 58 have far ultraviolet (FUV) counterparts with magnitudes brighter than 28.</description>

For example, Adams et al. identified the candidate ID 1514 with $\log_{10}(M_{}/M_{\odot}) = {9.8}{-0.2}^{+0.2}$ located at $z{\mathrm{phot}} = 9.85_{-0.12}^{+0.18}$ and Naidu et al. found even more distant candidates labeled as GL-z11 and GL-z13 with $\log_{10}(M_{}/M_{\odot}) = 9.</description>

Nyx is a nearby, prograde, and high-eccentricity stellar stream physically contained in the thick disk but with an unknown origin. Nyx could be the remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, in which case the associated dark matter substructure could affect terrestrial dark matter direct detection experiments. Alternatively, Nyx could be a signature of the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s disk formation and evolution. To determine the origin of Nyx, we obtained high-resolution spectroscopy of 34 Nyx stars using Keck/HIRES and Magellan/MIKE.</description>

In recent years, many questions have arisen regarding the chemistry of photochemical products in the carbon-rich winds of evolved stars. To address them, it is imperative to constrain the distributions of such species through high angular resolution interferometric observations covering multiple rotational transitions. We used archival ALMA observations to map rotational lines involving high energy levels of cyanoacetylene (HC$_3$N) toward the inner envelope (radius &amp;lt;8&amp;quot;/1000 AU) of the carbon star IRC+10216.</description>

Gamma-ray burst GRB 211211A may have been the result of a neutron star merger at $\approx350$ Mpc. However, none of the LIGO-Virgo detectors were operating at the time. We show that the gravitational-wave signal from a \grb-like binary neutron star inspiral in the next LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O4) would be below the conventional detection threshold, however a coincident gamma-ray burst observation would provide necessary information to claim a statistically-significant multimessenger observation.</description>

The view of globular clusters (GCs) as simple systems continues to unravel, revealing complex objects hosting multiple chemical peculiarities. Using differential abundance analysis, we probe the chemistry of the Type I GC, NGC 288 and the Type II GC, NGC 362 at the 2% level for the first time. We measure 20 elements and find differential measurement uncertainties on the order 0.01-0.02 dex in both clusters.</description>

Red supergiants (RSGs) are evolved massive stars in a stage preceding core-collapse supernova. The physical processes that trigger mass loss in their atmospheres are still not fully understood. Based on observations of $\alpha$ Ori, a new semi-empirical method to add a wind to hydrostatic model atmospheres of RSGs was recently developed. We use this method of adding a wind to a MARCS model atmosphere to compute synthetic observables, comparing the model to spatially resolved interferometric observations.</description>

Deriving oxygen abundances from the electron temperature (hereafter the $T_e$-method) is the gold-standard for extragalactic metallicity studies. However, unresolved temperature fluctuations in HII regions can bias metallicity estimates low, with a magnitude that depends on the underlying and typically unknown temperature distribution. Using a toy model, we confirm that computing $T_e$-based metallicities using the temperature derived from the [O III] $\lambda$4363/$\lambda$5007 ratio (&amp;lsquo;ratio temperature&amp;rsquo;; $T_{\rm ratio}$) results in an underprediction of metallicity when temperature fluctuations are present.</description>

Recent theoretical studies predict that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around low-redshift, $\sim L_{\ast}$ galaxies could have substantial nonthermal pressure support in the form of cosmic rays. However, these predictions are sensitive to the specific model of cosmic-ray transport employed, which is theoretically and observationally underconstrained. In this work, we propose a novel observational constraint for calculating the lower limit of the radially-averaged, effective cosmic-ray transport rate, $\kappa_{\rm min}^{\rm eff}$.</description>

Tensions between cosmological parameters (in particular the local expansion rate $H_0$ and the amplitude of matter clustering $S_8$) inferred from low-redshift data and data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS) experiments have inspired many extensions to the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Models which simultaneously lessen both tensions are of particular interest. We consider one scenario with the potential for such a resolution, in which some fraction of the dark matter has converted into dark radiation since the release of the CMB.</description>

Using a combination of photostimulated desorption and resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization methods, the behaviors of OH radicals on the surface of interstellar ice analog was monitored at temperatures between 54 and 80 K. The OH number density on the surface of ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated compact amorphous solid water gradually decreased at temperatures above 60 K. Analyzing the temperature dependence of OH intensities with the Arrhenius equation, the decrease can be explained by recombination of two OH radicals, which is rate-limited by thermal diffusion of OH.</description>

The diffuse light within galaxy groups and clusters provides valuable insight into the growth of massive cosmic structures. Groups are particularly interesting in this context, because they represent the link between galactic haloes and massive clusters. However, low surface brightness makes their diffuse light extremely challenging to detect individually. Stacking many groups is a promising alternative, but its physical interpretation is complicated by possible systematic variations of diffuse light profiles with other group properties.</description>

I argue that the assumption that the jets that shape the axisymmetrical morphological features of core collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants are post-kick jets, i.e., the neutron star (NS) launches these jets after the explosion and after it acquired its natal kick velocity, leads to the conclusion that the pre-collapse cores of CCSN progenitors have sufficient angular momentum fluctuations to support jittering jets that explode the star.</description>

MACS0647$-$JD is a triply-lensed $z\sim11$ galaxy originally discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we report new JWST imaging, which clearly resolves MACS0647$-$JD as having two components that are either merging galaxies or stellar complexes within a single galaxy. Both are very small, with stellar masses $\sim10^8,M_\odot$ and radii $r&amp;lt;100,\rm pc$. The brighter larger component &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; is intrinsically very blue ($\beta\sim-2.6$), likely due to very recent star formation and no dust, and is spatially extended with an effective radius $\sim70,\rm pc$.</description>

Barred structures are important in understanding galaxy evolution, but they were not included explicitly in most dynamical models for nearby galaxies due to their complicated morphological and kinematic properties. We modify the triaxial orbit-superposition Schwarzschild implementation by Van den Bosch et al. (2008) to include barred structures explicitly. The gravitational potential is a combination of a spherical dark matter halo and stellar mass; with the 3D stellar density distribution de-projected from the observed 2D image using a two-component de-projection method, including an axisymmetric disk and a triaxial barred bulge.</description>

The magnetic field is believed to play a critical role in the bulk acceleration and propagation of jets produced in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Polarization observations of AGN jets provide valuable information about their magnetic fields. As a result of radiative transfer, jet structure, and stratification, among other factors, it is not always straightforward to determine the magnetic field structures from observed polarization. We review these effects and their impact on polarization emission at a variety of wavelengths, including radio, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths in this paper.</description>

Numerical simulations in cosmology require trade-offs between volume, resolution and run-time that limit the volume of the Universe that can be simulated, leading to sample variance in predictions of ensemble-average quantities such as the power spectrum or correlation function(s). Sample variance is particularly acute at large scales, which is also where analytic techniques can be highly reliable. This provides an opportunity to combine analytic and numerical techniques in a principled way to improve the dynamic range and reliability of predictions for clustering statistics.</description>

Type Iax Supernovae (SNe Iax) form a class of peculiar SNe Ia, whose early-phase spectra share main spectral line identifications with canonical SNe Ia but with higher ionization and much lower line velocities. Their late-time behaviors deviate from usual SNe Ia in many respects; SNe Iax keep showing photospheric spectra over several 100 days and the luminosity decline is very slow. In the present work, we study the late-time spectra of SN Iax 2019muj including a newly-presented spectrum at ~500 days.</description>

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) offers new diagnostic possibilities that complement other commonly used diagnostics for the study of our Sun. In particular, ALMA&amp;rsquo;s ability to serve as an essentially linear thermometer of the chromospheric gas at unprecedented spatial resolution at millimetre wavelengths and future polarisation measurements have great diagnostic potential. Solar ALMA observations are therefore expected to contribute significantly to answering long-standing questions about the structure, dynamics and energy balance of the outer layers of the solar atmosphere.</description>

We find that the effective size, $R_e$, of galaxies strongly affects the abundance measurements: both [Mg/H] and [Fe/H] are anti-correlated with $R_e$, while the relative abundance [Mg/Fe] slightly increases with $R_e$.</description>

Inflationary gravitational waves, behaving as additional radiation in the Early Universe, can increase the effective number of relativistic species ($N_{\rm eff}$) by a further correction that depends on the integrated energy-density in gravitational waves over all scales. This effect is typically used to constrain (blue-tilted) models of inflation in light of the bounds resulting from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. In this paper, we recompute this contribution, discussing some caveats of the state-of-the-art analyses.</description>

      <description>First author: M. Lopez-Corredoira
A specific modification of Newtonian dynamics known as MOND has been shown to reproduce the dynamics of most astrophysical systems at different scales without invoking non-baryonic dark matter (DM). There is, however, a long-standing unsolved problem when MOND is applied to rich clusters of galaxies in the form of a deficit (by a factor around two) of predicted dynamical mass derived from the virial theorem with respect to observations.</description>

      <description>First author: B. Sykes
Fallback supernovae and the collapsar scenario for long-gamma ray burst and hypernovae have received considerable interest as pathways to black-hole formation and extreme transient events. Consistent simulations of these scenarios require a general relativistic treatment and need to deal appropriately with the formation of a singularity. Free evolution schemes for the Einstein equations can handle the formation of black holes by means of excision or puncture schemes.</description>

      <description>First author: E. Redaelli
Prestellar cores, the birthplace of Sun-like stars, form from the fragmentation of the filamentary structure that composes molecular clouds, from which they must inherit at least partially the kinematics. Furthermore, when they are on the verge of gravitational collapse, they show signs of subsonic infall motions. How extended these motions are, which depends on how the collapse occurs, remains largely unknown. We want to investigate the kinematics of the envelope that surrounds the prototypical prestellar core L1544, studying the cloud-core connection.</description>

We present Herschel, ALMA, and MUSE observations of the molecular ring of Messier 104, also known as the Sombrero galaxy. These previously unpublished archival data shed new light on the content of the interstellar medium of M104. In particular, molecular hydrogen measured by CO emission and dust measured by far-infrared light are uniformly distributed along the ring. The ionized gas revealed by H$\alpha$ and $[CII]$ emission is distributed in knots along the ring.</description>

      <description>First author: Peter Breiding
Over 150 resolved, kpc-scale X-ray jets hosted by active galactic nuclei have been discovered with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. A significant fraction of these jets have an X-ray spectrum either too high in flux or too hard to be consistent with the high-energy extension of the radio-to-optical synchrotron spectrum, a subtype we identify as Multiple Spectral Component (MSC) X-ray jets. A leading hypothesis for the origin of the X-rays is the inverse-Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background by the same electron population producing the radio-to-optical synchrotron spectrum (known as the IC/CMB model).</description>

We report the detection of a long-timescale negative lag, where the blue bands lag the red bands, in the nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy Fairall 9. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) light curves show variability over a wide range of timescales. By measuring time lags between different wavelengths, the otherwise inaccessible structure and kinematics of the accretion disk can be studied. One common approach, reverberation mapping, quantifies the continuum and line lags moving outwards through the disk at the light-travel time, revealing the size and temperature profile of the disk.</description>

      <description>First author: Lilit V. Barkhudaryan
In this Letter, using classified 197 supernovae (SNe) Ia, we perform an analyses of their height distributions from the disc in edge-on spirals and investigate their light-curve (LC) decline rates $(\Delta m_{15})$. We demonstrate, for the first time, that 91T-, 91bg-like, and normal SNe Ia subclasses are distributed differently toward the plane of their host disc. The average height from the disc and its comparison with scales of thin/thick disc components gives a possibility to roughly estimate the SNe Ia progenitor ages: 91T-like events, being at the smallest heights, originate from relatively younger progenitors with ages of about several 100 Myr, 91bg-like SNe, having the highest distribution, arise from progenitors with significantly older ages $\sim 10$ Gyr, and normal SNe Ia, which distributed between those of the two others, are from progenitors of about one up to $\sim 10$ Gyr.</description>

      <description>First author: Nadine H. Soliman
Partial dust obscuration in active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been proposed as a potential explanation for some cases of AGN variability. The dust-gas mixture present in AGN torii is accelerated by radiation pressure leading to the launching of an AGN wind. Dust under these conditions has been shown to be unstable to a generic class of fast growing resonant drag instabilities (RDIs). We present the first set of numerical simulations of radiation driven outflows that include explicit dust dynamics in conditions resembling AGN winds and discuss the implications of the RDIs on the morphology of the AGN torus, AGN variability, and the ability of the radiation to effectively launch a wind.</description>

Gaseous outflows are key phenomena in the evolution of galaxies, as they affect star formation (either positively or negatively), eject gas from the core or disk, and directly cause mixing of pristine and processed material. Active outflows may be detected through searches for broad spectral line emission or high-velocity gas, but it is also possible to determine the presence of past outflows by searching for extended reservoirs of chemically enriched molecular gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxies.</description>

      <description>First author: Wilmar Cardona
Interesting discrepancies in cosmological parameters are challenging the success of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Direct measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ using Cepheid variables and supernovae turn out to be higher than inferred from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Weak galaxy lensing surveys consistently report values of the strength of matter clustering $\sigma_8$ lower than values derived from the CMB in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. In this paper we address these discrepancies in cosmological parameters by considering Dark Energy (DE) as a fluid with evolving equation of state $w_{\mathrm{de}}(z)$, constant sound speed squared $\hat{c}{\mathrm{s}}^{2}$, and vanishing anisotropic stress $\sigma$.</description>

      <description>First author: David Garofalo
Jet re-orientation associated with the time evolution of radio quasars explains the formation of X-shaped radio galaxies and their preference for isolated environments. But since X-shaped radio galaxies are generally not found in dense environments (e.g. groups/clusters), the jet re-orientation phenomenon for radio galaxies in groups and clusters has been ignored. We take a closer look at the re-orientation of FRI jets with respect to FRII jets, and find that it may constitute the as-yet unidentified trigger for star formation suppression in radio galaxies.</description>

The fast evolving TeV-PeV transients and their delayed GeV-TeV cascade emission in principle server as an ideal probe of the inter-galactic magnetic fields which are hard to be measured by other methods. Very recently, LHASSO has detected the very high energy emission of the extraordinary powerful GRB 221009A up to $\sim 18$ TeV within $\sim 2000$ s after the burst trigger. Here we report the detection of a $\sim 400$ GeV photon, without accompanying prominent $\gamma$ rays down to $\sim 2$ GeV, by Fermi-LAT in the direction of GRB 221009A at about 0.</description>

Magnetospheres of neutron stars can be perturbed by star quakes or interaction in a binary system. The perturbations are typically in the kHz band and excite magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. We show that compressive magnetospheric waves steepen into monster shocks mediated by radiation reaction, different from normal collisionless shocks. The shocks admit a simple analytical description. They expand through the magnetosphere with radiative losses, and then a blast wave is launched into the neutron-star wind.</description>

We present a study of barred galaxies in the cluster environment, exploiting a sample of galaxies drawn from the extended WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (OmegaWINGS) that covers up to the outer regions of 32 local X-ray selected clusters. Barred galaxies are identified through a semi-automatic analysis of ellipticity and position angle profiles. We find, in agreement with previous studies, a strong co-dependence of the bar fraction with the galaxy stellar mass and morphological type, being maximum for massive late-type galaxies.</description>

Cosmic voids are known as underdense substructures of the cosmic web that cover a large volume of the Universe. It is known that cosmic voids contain a small number of dark matter halos, so the existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) in these secluded regions of the Universe is not unlikely. In this work, we calculate the merger rate of PBHs in dark matter halos structured in cosmic voids and determine their contribution to gravitational wave events resulting from black hole mergers recorded by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO)-Advanced Virgo (aVirgo) detectors.</description>

The presence of phosphine (PH$_3$) in the atmosphere of Venus was reported by Greaves et al. (2021a), based on observations of the J=1-0 transition at 267 GHz using ground-based, millimeter-wave spectroscopy. This unexpected discovery presents a challenge for our understanding of Venus&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, and has led to a reappraisal of the possible sources and sinks of atmospheric phosphorous-bearing gases. Here we present results from a search for PH$_3$ on Venus using the GREAT instrument aboard the SOFIA aircraft, over three flights conducted in November 2021.</description>

The analysis of cosmological galaxy surveys requires realistic simulations for their interpretation. Forward modelling is a powerful method to simulate galaxy clustering without the need for an underlying complex model. This approach requires fast cosmological simulations with a high resolution and large volume, to resolve small dark matter halos associated to single galaxies. In this work, we present fast halo and subhalo clustering simulations based on the Lagrangian perturbation theory code PINOCCHIO, which generates halos and merger trees.</description>

We present simulations of the capabilities of the ngVLA to image at $\sim 0.75$ kpc resolution ($0.085&amp;quot;$), molecular line emission from star forming disk galaxies at high redshift. The results are compared to the current capabilities of ALMA. ALMA can detect the integrated emission, and determine the velocity gradient and size across the brighter emission regions of the galaxy. The ngVLA is a factor $\sim 6$ more sensitive at the adopted spatial and velocity resolution.</description>

AI super-resolution, combining deep learning and N-body simulations has been shown to successfully reproduce the large scale structure and halo abundances in the Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmological model. Here, we extend its use to models with a different dark matter content, in this case Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), in the approximation that the difference is encoded in the initial power spectrum. We focus on redshift z = 2, with simulations that model smaller scales and lower masses, the latter by two orders of magnitude, than has been done in previous AI super-resolution work.</description>

We incorporate new scale-intelligent models of metal-enriched star formation (\starss) with surrogate models of primordial stellar feedback (\starnet) into the astrophysics simulation code \enzo to analyze the impact of heterogeneous metal enrichment on the first galaxies. Our study includes the earliest generations of stars and the protogalaxies ($10^6 \lesssim M_v/M_\odot \lesssim 10^8$) containing them. We compare results obtained with the new methods to two common paradigms of metallicity initial conditions in simulations: ignoring the metallicity initial condition and assuming a uniform metallicity floor.</description>

Aims: We aim to spatially and spectrally resolve the Br-gamma hydrogen emission line with the methods of interferometry in order to examine the kinematics of the hydrogen gas emission region in the inner accretion disk of a sample of solar-like young stellar objects. The goal is to identify trends and categories among the sources of our sample and to discuss whether or not they can be tied to different origin mechanisms associated with Br-gamma emission in T Tauri stars, chiefly and most prominently magnetospheric accretion.</description>

      <description>First author: George Contopoulos
The most important theory of the spiral arms of galaxies is the density wave theory based on the Lin-Shu dispersion relation. However, the density waves move with the group velocity towards the inner Lindblad resonance and tend to disappear. Various mechanisms to replenish the spiral waves have been proposed. Nonlinear effects play an important role near the inner and outer Lindblad resonances and corotation. The orbits supporting the spiral arms are precessing ellipses in normal galaxies that extend up to the 4/1 resonance.</description>

Extracting the non-Gaussian information encoded in the higher-order clustering statistics of the large-scale structure is key to fully realizing the potential of upcoming galaxy surveys. We investigate the information content of the redshift-space {\it weighted skew spectra} of biased tracers as efficient estimators for 3-point clustering statistics. The skew spectra are constructed by correlating the observed galaxy field with an appropriately-weighted square of it. We perform numerical Fisher forecasts using two synthetic datasets; the halo catalogs from the Quijote N-body simulations and the galaxy catalogs from the Molino suite.</description>

      <description>First author: Bruce Edelman
We introduce the first complete non-parametric model for the astrophysical distribution of the binary black hole (BBH) population. Constructed from basis splines, we use these models to conduct the most comprehensive data-driven investigation of the BBH population to date, simultaneously fitting non-parametric models for the BBH mass ratio, spin magnitude and misalignment, and redshift distributions. With GWTC-3, we report the same features previously recovered with similarly flexible models of the mass distribution, most notably the peaks in merger rates at primary masses of ${\sim}10,M_\odot$ and ${\sim}35,M_\odot$.</description>

We study how supersonic streaming velocities of baryons relative to dark matter &amp;ndash; a large-scale effect imprinted at recombination and coherent over $\sim 3$ Mpc scales &amp;ndash; affects the formation of dwarf galaxies at $z \gtrsim 5$. We perform cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, including and excluding streaming velocities, in regions centered on halos with $M_{\rm vir}(z=0) \approx 10^{10}$ M${\odot}$; the simulations are part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project and run with FIRE-3 physics.</description>

The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, a key mission in multiwavelength and multimessenger studies, has been surveying the gamma-ray sky from its low-Earth orbit since 2008. Its two scientific instruments, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and the Large Area Telescope (LAT), cover 8 orders of magnitude in photon energy. The GBM consists of 12 Sodium Iodide detectors and 2 Bismuth Germinate detectors, covering the 10 keV - 40 MeV energy range, arrayed on two sides of the spacecraft so as to view the entire sky that is not occulted by the Earth.</description>

We report an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) with extremely high equivalent width (EW), EW(LyA+NV,rest)&amp;gt;921 AA in the rest-frame, at z~2.24 in the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment Survey (HETDEX) as a representative case of the high EW AGN population. The continuum level is a non-detection in the HETDEX spectrum, thus the measured EW is a lower limit. The source is detected with significant emission lines (&amp;gt;7sigma) at LyA+NV, CIV, and moderate emission line (~4sigma) at HeII within the wavelength coverage of HETDEX (3500 AA - 5500 AA).</description>

Interstellar (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxies are linked to several physical processes that drive galaxy evolution. For example, the X-ray emission from the CGM gas around ellipticals has been linked to the AGN feedback occurring in the host. Upcoming telescopes such as HUBS, with ~ 1 eV resolution, can provide us with deep insights about the hot gas properties of such galaxies thus constrain these processes.</description>

      <description>First author: G. Pascoli
The existence of the flat rotation curves of galaxies is still perplexing. The dark matter paradigm was proposed long ago to solve this conundrum; however, this proposal is still under debate. In this paper, we search for universal relationships solely involving the baryonic density that incorporate both galactic dynamics and gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters without requiring dark matter. If this type of formula exists, we show that it is possible that it can clearly indicate that dark matter is either perfectly tailored to baryonic matter or, from a more radical point of view, even perhaps useless.</description>

We combine the kinematics of 159 globular clusters (GCs) provided by the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR 3) with other observational data to classify the GCs, and to estimate the mass of Milky Way (MW). We use the age-metallicity relation, integrals of motion, action space and the GC orbits to identify the GCs as either formed in-situ (Bulge and Disk) or ex-situ (via accretion).

Our goal is to determine, with high accuracy, the physical and orbital parameters of two double-lined eclipsing binary systems, where the components are two giant stars. We also aim to study the evolutionary status of the binaries, to derive the distances towards them by using a surface brightness-colour relation, and to compare these measurements with the measurements presented by the Gaia mission. In order to measure the physical and orbital parameters of the systems, we analysed the light curves and radial-velocity curves with the Wilson-Devinney code.</description>

Both the CN-s RGB and RHB populations are more centrally concentrated than those of CN-w populations are.</description>

Although H${2}$ is the simplest and the most abundant molecule in the Universe, its formation in the interstellar medium, especially in the photodissociation regions is far from being fully understood. According to suggestions, the formation of H${2}$ is catalyzed by polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on the surface of interstellar grains. In the present study, we have investigated the catalytic effect of small PAHs with an imperfect aromatic system.</description>

      <description>Seyoung Jeon,
Recent high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with a variety of codes systematically predict large amounts of entropy in the intra-cluster medium at low redshift, leading to flat entropy profiles and a suppressed cool-core population. This prediction is at odds with X-ray observations of groups and clusters. We use a new implementation of the EAGLE galaxy formation model to investigate the sensitivity of the central entropy and the shape of the profiles to changes in the sub-grid model applied to a suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations of a group of mass M500=8.</description>

Cluster galaxies exhibit substantially lower star formation rates than field galaxies today, but it is conceivable that clusters were sites of more active star formation in the early universe. Herein, we present an interpretation of the star formation history (SFH) of group/cluster galaxies based on the large-scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, Horizon-AGN. We find that massive galaxies in general have small values of e-folding timescales of star formation decay (i.</description>

Most stars form in clumpy and sub-structured clusters. These properties also emerge in hydro-dynamical simulations of star-forming clouds, which provide a way to generate realistic initial conditions for N−body runs of young stellar clusters. However, producing large sets of initial conditions by hydro-dynamical simulations is prohibitively expensive in terms of computational time. We introduce a novel technique for generating new initial conditions from a given sample of hydro-dynamical simulations, at a tiny computational cost.</description>

Our main focus is on the distributions of the stellar populations of those systems in the $[Mg/Fe]$-$[Fe/H]$ and $[Mg/Mn]$-$[Al/Fe]$ planes, which are commonly employed in the literature for chemical diagnosis and where dwarf galaxies can be distinguished from in situ populations.</description>

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions in the universe. The standard model invokes a relativistic fireball with a bright photosphere emission component. How efficiently the jet converts its energy to radiation is a long-standing problem and it is poorly constrained. A definitive diagnosis of GRB radiation components and measurement of GRB radiative efficiency requires prompt emission and afterglow data with high-resolution and wide-band coverage in time and energy.</description>

Galaxies throughout the last 12 Gyr of cosmic time follow a single, universal fundamental plane that relates their star-formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses ($M_\star$) and chemical abundances. Deviation from these fundamental scaling relations would imply a drastic change in the processes that regulate galaxy evolution. Observations have hinted at the possibility that this relation may be broken in the very early universe. However, until recently, chemical abundances of galaxies could be only measured reliably as far back as redshift $z = 3.</description>

Cosmological weak lensing measurements rely on a precise measurement of the shear two-point correlation function (2PCF) along with a deep understanding of systematics that affect it. In this work, we demonstrate a general framework for describing the impact of PSF systematics on the cosmic shear 2PCF, and mitigating its impact on cosmological analysis. Our framework can describe leakage and modeling error from all spin-2 quantities contributed by the PSF second and higher moments, rather than just the second moments.</description>

The discrepancy between the mass of galaxies and their rotational velocity is one of the most puzzling scientific phenomena. Despite over a century of research, this phenomenon is not fully understood. Common explanations include dark matter and MOND, among other theories. Here we report on another observation that shows tension between the physics of galaxy rotation and its rotational velocity. We compare the brightness of galaxies, and find that galaxies that spin in the same direction as the Milky Way have different brightness than galaxies that spin in the opposite direction.</description>

We review the distortions of spectra of relic neutrinos due to the interactions with electrons, positrons, and neutrinos in the early universe. We solve integro-differential kinetic equations for the neutrino density matrix, including vacuum three-flavor neutrino oscillations, oscillations in electron and positron background, a collision term and finite temperature corrections to electron mass and electromagnetic plasma up to the next-to-leading order $\mathcal{O}(e^3)$. After that, we estimate the effects of the spectral distortions in neutrino decoupling on the number density and energy density of the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$ν$B) in the current universe, and discuss the implications of these effects on the capture rates in direct detection of the C$ν$B on tritium, with emphasis on the PTOLEMY-type experiment.</description>

Third-order weak lensing statistics are a promising tool for cosmological analyses since they extract cosmological information in the non-Gaussianity of the cosmic large-scale structure. However, such analyses require precise and accurate models for the covariance. In this second paper of a series on third-order weak lensing statistics, we derive and validate an analytic model for the covariance of the third-order aperture statistics $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^3\rangle$. We derive the covariance model from a real-space estimator for $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^3\rangle$.</description>

      <description>First author: Varenya Upadhyaya
We search for a linearity in the ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter as a function of radius for galaxy clusters, motivated by a recent result by Lovas (arXiv:2206.11431), who has discovered such a linearity for a diverse suite of galaxies in the SPARC sample. For our analysis, we used a sample of 54 non-cool core clusters from the HIFLUGCS sample. We do not find any evidence for a linear trend in the aforementioned ratio as a function of radius for individual clusters.</description>

      <description>First author: W. Zhang
We study the Fourier time-lags due to the Comptonization of disc-emitted photons in a spherical, uniform, and stationary X-ray corona, which located on the rotational axis of the black hole. We use Monk, a general relativistic Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, to calculate Compton scattering of photons emitted by a thin disc with a Novikov-Thorne temperature profile. We find that the model time-lags due to Comptonization remain constant up to a characteristic frequency and then rapidly decrease to zero at higher frequencies.</description>

Alternative cosmological models have been under deep scrutiny in recent years, aiming to address the main shortcomings of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, as the accuracy of cosmological surveys improved, new tensions have risen between the model-dependent analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background and lower redshift probes. Within this framework, we review two quantum-inspired non-locally extended theories of gravity, whose main cosmological feature is a geometrically driven accelerated expansion.</description>

      <description>First author: Caleb Lammers
Despite the importance of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) in models of galaxy evolution, observational constraints on the influence of AGN feedback on star formation remain weak. To this end, we have compared the star formation trends of 279 low-redshift AGN galaxies with 558 non-active control galaxies using integral field unit spectroscopy from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. With a Gaussian process-based methodology, we reconstruct non-parametric star formation histories in spatially-resolved spaxels covering the face of each galaxy.</description>

In galactic disks, the Parker instability results when non-thermal pressure support exceeds a certain threshold. The non-thermal pressures considered in the Parker instability are cosmic ray pressure and magnetic pressure. This instability takes a long time to saturate $(&amp;gt;500 , \mathrm{Myr})$ and assumes a background with fixed cosmic ray pressure to gas pressure ratio. In reality, galactic cosmic rays are injected into localized regions $(&amp;lt; 100 ,\mathrm{pc})$ by events like supernovae, increasing the cosmic ray pressure to gas pressure ratio.</description>

We examine the quenching characteristics of $328$ isolated dwarf galaxies $\left(10^{8} &amp;lt; M_{\rm star}/M_\odot &amp;lt; 10^{10} \right)$ within the \Rom{} cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. Using mock observation methods, we identify isolated dwarf galaxies with quenched star formation and make direct comparisons to the quenched fraction in the NASA Sloan Atlas (NSA). Similar to other cosmological simulations, we find a population of quenched, isolated dwarf galaxies below $M_{\rm star} &amp;lt; 10^{9} M_\odot$ not detected within the NSA.</description>

A suggested model for quasi&amp;ndash;periodic eruptions (QPEs) from galaxy nuclei invokes a white dwarf in an eccentric orbit about the central massive black hole. I point out that the extreme mass ratio allows the presence of strong Lindblad resonances in the accretion disc. These are important for the stability of mass transfer, and may trigger the eruptions themselves by rapidly transferring angular momentum from the accretion disc (which is likely to be eccentric itself) to the orbiting WD companion at pericentre.</description>

We present BIFROST, an extended version of the GPU-accelerated hierarchical fourth-order forward symplectic integrator code FROST. BIFROST (BInaries in FROST) can efficiently evolve collisional stellar systems with arbitrary binary fractions up to fbin=100% by using secular and regularised integration for binaries, triples, multiple systems or small clusters around black holes within the fourth-order forward integrator framework. Post-Newtonian (PN) terms up to order PN3.5 are included in the equations of motion of compact subsystems with optional three-body and spin-dependent terms.</description>

We have observed the z=4.3 protocluster SPT2349-56 with ATCA with the aim of detecting radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) amongst the ~30 submillimeter galaxies identified in the structure. We detect the central complex of SMGs at 2.2,GHz with a luminosity of L_2.2=(4.42pm0.56)x10^{25} W/Hz. The ASKAP also detects the source at 888 MHz, constraining the radio spectral index to alpha=-1.6pm0.3, consistent with ATCA non-detections at 5.</description>

Stellar streams are a promising tool to study the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s dark matter subhalo population, as interactions with subhalos could produce substructure in streams. However, other possible causes for substructure first need to be well understood. Here we study the kinematics and the unusual morphology of the stellar stream Jhelum. Using a combination of ground-based photometry and Gaia EDR3 astrometry we characterize the morphology of Jhelum. We combine this new data with radial velocities from the literature to perform orbit integrations of the stream in static Galactic potentials.</description>

We explore a possible scenario of the explosion as a result of core collapses of rotating massive stars that leave a black hole by performing a radiation-viscous-hydrodynamics simulation in numerical relativity. We take moderately and rapidly rotating compact pre-collapse stellar models derived in stellar evolution calculations as the initial conditions. We find that the viscous heating in the disk formed around the central black hole powers an outflow.</description>

In the submm regime, spectral line scans and line intensity mapping (LIM) are new promising probes for the cold gas content and star formation rate of galaxies across cosmic time. However, both of these two measurements suffer from field-to-field variance. We study the effect of field-to-field variance on the predicted CO and CII power spectra from future LIM experiments such as CONCERTO, as well as on the line luminosity functions (LFs) and the cosmic molecular gas mass density that are currently derived from spectral line scans.</description>

Cosmic inflation is arguably the most favoured paradigm of the very early Universe. It postulates an early phase of fast, nearly exponential, and accelerated expansion. Inflationary models are capable of explaining the overall flatness and homogeneity of today&amp;rsquo;s Universe at large scales. Despite being widely accepted by the physics community, these models are not absent from criticism. In scalar field inflation, a necessary condition to begin inflation is the requirement of a Universe dominated by the field&amp;rsquo;s potential, which implies a subdominant contribution from the scalar field dynamics.</description>

We develop a pipeline to generate simulated convergence maps from cosmological $N$-body simulations, where we account for effects such as intrinsic alignments (IAs), baryons, photometric redshift errors, and point spread function errors, to match characteristics of the real catalogue.</description>

We extract a sample of voids from the distribution of galaxies and we apply a cleaning procedure aimed at reaching high levels of purity and completeness. We model the void size function by means of an extension of the popular volume-conserving model, based on two additional nuisance parameters.</description>

How galaxies form, assemble, and cease their star-formation is a central question within the modern landscape of galaxy evolution studies.

We present constraints on the shape and evolution of the SMF, the quiescent galaxy fraction, and the cosmic stellar mass density across 90% of the history of the Universe from $z=7.5\rightarrow0.2$ via the COSMOS survey.</description>

Both surveys were obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope, and contain thousands of GCs in dozens of galaxies each.</description>

Surveys with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have discovered candidate galaxies in the first 400 Myr of cosmic time. The properties of these distant galaxies provide initial conditions for understanding early galaxy formation and cosmic reionisation. Preliminary indications have suggested these candidate galaxies may be more massive and abundant than previously thought. However, without spectroscopic confirmation of their distances to constrain their intrinsic brightnesses, their inferred properties remain uncertain.</description>

It has a physical half-light radius of 26.9$^{+7.5}_{-5.4}$ pc, a $V$-band magnitude of $-$4.5 $\pm$ 0.4 mag, and resides at a heliocentric distance of approximately 100 kpc.</description>

Globular Clusters (GCs) provide valuable insight into the properties of their host galaxies&amp;rsquo; dark matter halos. Using N-body simulations incorporating semianalytic dynamical friction and GC-GC merger prescriptions, we study the evolution of GC radial distributions and mass functions in cuspy and cored dark matter halos. Modeling the dynamics of the GC-rich system in the dwarf galaxy UGC7369, we find that friction-induced inspiral and subsequent mergers of massive GCs can naturally and robustly explain the mass segregation of the GCs and the existence of a nuclear star cluster (NSC).</description>

We compare 500~pc scale, resolved observations of ionised and molecular gas for the $z\sim0.02$ starbursting disk galaxy IRAS08339+6517, using measurements from KCWI and NOEMA. We explore the relationship of the star formation driven ionised gas outflows with colocated galaxy properties. We find a roughly linear relationship between the outflow mass flux ($\dotΣ_{\rm out}$) and star formation rate surface density ($Σ_{\rm SFR}$), $\dotΣ_{\rm out}\proptoΣ_{\rm SFR}^{1.06\pm0.10}$, and a strong correlation between $\dotΣ_{\rm out}$ and the gas depletion time, such that $\dotΣ_{\rm out} \propto t_{dep}^{-1.</description>

We study the optical variability of a sample of candidate low-mass (dwarf ang Seyfert) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using Zwicky Transient Facility g-band light curves. Our sample is compiled from broad-line AGNs in dwarf galaxies reported in the literature with single-epoch virial black hole (BH) masses in the range $M_{\rm{BH}} \sim 10^{4}$&amp;ndash;$10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$. We measure the characteristic ``damping&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; timescale of the optical variability $\tau_{\rm{DRW}}$, beyond which the power spectral density flattens, of a final sample of 79 candidate low-mass AGNs with high-quality light curves.</description>

      <description>First author: Michaela Hirschmann
We compute synthetic, rest-frame optical and ultraviolet (UV) emission-line properties of galaxy populations at redshifts from z$\approx$0 to z=8 in a full cosmological framework. We achieve this by coupling, in post-processing, the cosmological IllustrisTNG simulations with new-generation nebular-emission models, accounting for line emission from young stars, post-asymptotic-giant-branch (PAGB) stars, accreting black holes (BHs) and, for the first time, fast radiative shocks. The optical emission-line properties of simulated galaxies dominated by different ionizing sources are largely consistent with those expected from classical diagnostic diagrams and reflect the observed increase in OIII/H$\beta$ at fixed NII/H$\alpha$ and the evolution of the H$\alpha$, OIII$\lambda5007$ and OII$\lambda3727$ luminosity functions from z$\approx$0 to z$\sim$2.</description>

      <description>Andrew Cheek
Many cosmological phenomena lead to the production of primordial black holes in the early Universe. These phenomena often create a population of black holes with extended mass and spin distributions. As these black holes evaporate via Hawking radiation, they can modify various cosmological observables, lead to the production of dark matter, modify the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom, $N_{\rm eff}$, source a stochastic gravitational wave background and alter the dynamics of baryogenesis.</description>

We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0607-4448 (SPT0607), which is one of the most distant clusters discovered by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) at $z=1.4010\pm0.0028$. The high-redshift cluster shows clear signs of being relaxed with well-regulated feedback from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Using Chandra X-ray data, we construct thermodynamic profiles and determine the properties of the intracluster medium.</description>

Using mock data for SNIa, QSOs and GRBs generated based on the power-law $f(T)$ model, we show whether different cosmographic methods are suitable to reconstruct the distance modulus or not.</description>

      <description>First author: Lewis R. Prole
Molecular hydrogen allows cooling in primordial gas, facilitating its collapse into Population III stars within primordial halos. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from these stars can escape the halo and delay further star formation by destroying H$2$ in other halos. As cosmological simulations show that increasing the background LW field strength increases the average halo mass required for star formation, we perform follow-up simulations of selected halos to investigate the knock-on effects this has on the Population III IMF.</description>

The fundamentals of estimating essential stellar parameters of an open cluster-NGC 2360 and globular clusters-NGC 5272 are presented extensively in this work. Here, the evaluation of stellar parameters, by manually fitting the appropriate isochrones on the color magnitude diagrams (CMDs), of the selected star clusters is discussed comprehensively. Aperture photometry and PSF fitting photometry are conducted on g, r, and i standard band filter images of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) using the aperture photometry tool (APT) to obtain the respective CMDs.</description>

In this paper, we study how gaseous dynamical friction (DF) affects the motion of fly-by stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs. We perform 3-body integrations of the interaction of two co-planar sBHs in nearby, initially circular orbits around the supermassive black hole (SMBH). We find that DF can facilitate the formation of gravitationally bound near-Keplerian binaries in AGN discs, and we delineate the discrete ranges of impact parameters and AGN disc parameters for which such captures occur.</description>

We present radial gas-phase metallicity profiles, gradients, and break radii at redshift $z = 0 - 3$ from the TNG50-1 star-forming galaxy population. These metallicity profiles are characterized by an emphasis on identifying the steep inner gradient and flat outer gradient. From this, the break radius, $r_{\rm Break}$, is defined as the region where the transition occurs. We observe the break radius having a positive trend with mass that weakens with redshift.</description>

Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry is providing an extensive analysis of globular clusters (GCs). In particular, the pseudo two-colour diagram dubbed &#39;chromosome map (ChM)&#39; allowed to detect and characterize their multiple populations with unprecedented detail. The main limitation of these studies is the small field of view of HST, which makes it challenging to investigate some important aspects of the multiple populations, such as their spatial distributions and the internal kinematics in the outermost cluster regions.</description>

We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging of 14 gas-rich, low surface brightness and ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the field at distances of 25-36 Mpc. An inspection of point-like sources brighter than the turnover magnitude of the globular cluster luminosity function and within twice the half-light radii of each galaxy reveals that, unlike those in denser environments, gas-rich, field UDGs host very few old globular clusters (GCs). Most of the targets (nine) have zero candidate GCs, with the remainder having one or two candidates each.</description>

We discuss a GC formation scenario in which the first generation (1G) of single asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and intermediate-mass close binaries (IMCBs) eject gas, from which the second generation (2G) of stars can be formed. The two key parameters in the scenario are the fractions of binary stars (f_b) and the slopes (alpha) of the stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) for 1G stars. Principle results derived by analytic and one-zone models of GC formation are as follows.</description>

The metallicity distributions of globular cluster (GC) systems in galaxies are a critical test of any GC formation scenario. In this work, we investigate the predicted GC metallicity distributions of galaxies in the MOdelling Star cluster population Assembly In Cosmological Simulations within EAGLE (E-MOSAICS) simulation of a representative cosmological volume (L=34.4 comoving Mpc). We find that the predicted GC metallicity distributions and median metallicities from the fiducial E-MOSAICS GC formation model agree well the observed distributions, except for galaxies with masses M∗∼2×1010 M⊙, which contain an overabundance of metal-rich GCs.</description>

Context: Population III (Pop III) stars may be fast rotating. An expected consequence of fast rotation is strong internal mixing that deeply affects their evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and hence their ionising power. aims: We investigate the impact on the ionising power of Pop III stars in an extreme case of internal mixing, the one leading to chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). In that situation, during the main sequence phase, the star keeps the same chemical composition from its center to its surface.</description>

We investigate the dynamics and electromagnetic (EM) signatures of neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) merger ejecta that occurs in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find that the interaction between ejecta and disk gas leads to important effects on the dynamics and radiation. We show five stages of the ejecta dynamics: gravitational slowing down, coasting, Sedov-Taylor deceleration in the disk, re-acceleration after the breakout from the disk surface, and momentum-conserved snowplow phase.</description>

Recent attempts to detect OIII 88$\mu$m emission from super-early ($z&amp;gt;10$) galaxy candidates observed by JWST have been unsuccessful. By using zoom-in simulations, we show that these galaxies are faint, and mostly fall below the local metal-poor $[OIII]-SFR$ relation as a result of their low ionization parameter, $U_{\rm ion}\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Such low $U_{\rm ion}$ values are found in galaxies that are in an early assembly stage, and whose stars are still embedded in high-density natal clouds.</description>

JWST high redshift galaxy observations predict a higher star formation efficiency than the standard cosmology does, which poses a new tension to $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the situation is worse than expected. The true situation is that the Planck CMB measurement has a strong tension with JWST high redshift galaxy observations. Specifically, we make a trial to alleviate this tension by considering alternative cosmological models including dark matter-baryon interaction, $f(R)$ gravity and dynamical dark energy.</description>

Impulsive supernova feedback and non-standard dark matter models, such as self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), are the two main contenders for the role of the dominant core formation mechanism at the dwarf galaxy scale. Here we show that the impulsive supernova cycles that follow episodes of bursty star formation leave distinct features in the distribution function of stars: groups of stars with similar ages and metallicities develop overdense shells in phase space.</description>

We investigate the kinematic-chemical distribution of Red Giant Branch (RGB)stars from the LAMOST survey crossed matched with Gaia DR2 proper motions, and present time tagging for the well-known ridge structures (diagonal distributions for $V_R$ in the $R$, $V_φ$ plane) in the range of Galactocentric distance $R$ = 8 to 15 kpc. We detect six ridge structures, including five ridges apparent in the radial velocity distribution and three ridges apparent in the vertical velocity, the sensitive time of which to the perturbations are from young population (0$-$3 Gyr) to old population (9$-$14 Gyr).</description>

Fluctuations play a critical role in cosmology. They are relevant across a range of phenomena from the dynamics of inflation to the formation of structure. In many cases, these fluctuations are coarse grained and follow a Gaussian distribution as a consequence of the Central Limit Theorem. Yet, some classes of observables are dominated by rare fluctuations and are sensitive to the details of the underlying microphysics. In this paper, we argue that the Large Deviation Principle can be used to diagnose when one must to appeal to the fundamental description.</description>

      <description>First author: Shuai Zha
Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) mark the explosive death of red supergiants (RSGs), evolved massive stars with an extended hydrogen envelope. They are the most common supernova type and allow for benchmarking of supernova explosion models by statistical comparison to observed population properties rather than comparing individual models and events. We construct a large synthetic set of SNe IIP light curves (LCs) using the radiation hydrodynamics code \texttt{SNEC} and explosion energies and nickel masses obtained from an efficient semi-analytic model for two different sets of stellar progenitor models.</description>

We develop a novel approach to measure dust attenuation properties of galaxies,including the dust opacity and shape of the attenuation curve in both optical and NUV, as well as the strength of the 2175{\AA} absorption feature. From an observed spectrum the method uses a model-independent approach to derive a relative attenuation curve.The absolute amplitude is then calibrated with the NIR photometry. The dust-corrected spectrum is fitted with stellar population models to derive the dust-free model spectrum covering the whole wavelength range from NUV to NIR and is compared with the observed SED/spectrum to determine dust attenuation properties.</description>

Owing to their quiet evolutionary histories, nearby dwarf galaxies (stellar masses $M_\star \lesssim 3 \times 10^9 M_\odot$) have the potential to teach us about the mechanism(s) that &amp;lsquo;seeded&amp;rsquo; the growth of supermassive black holes, and also how the first stellar mass black holes formed and interacted with their environments.

Hadronic $\gamma$-ray sources associated with supernova remnants (SNRs) can serve as stopwatches for the escape of cosmic rays from SNRs, which gradually develops from highest-energy particles to lowest-energy particles with time. In this work, we analyze the 13.7~yr \emph{Fermi}-LAT data to investigate the $\gamma$-ray feature in/around the SNR G298.6$-$0.0 region. With $\gamma$-ray spatial analyses, we detect three point-like components. Among them, Src-NE is at the eastern SNR shell, and Src-NW is adjacent to the western edge of this SNR.</description>

Recent cosmological analyses with large-scale structure and weak lensing measurements, usually referred to as 3$\times$2pt, had to discard a lot of signal-to-noise from small scales due to our inability to precisely model non-linearities and baryonic effects. Galaxy-galaxy lensing, or the position-shear correlation between lens and source galaxies, is one of the three two-point correlation functions that are included in such analyses, usually estimated with the mean tangential shear.</description>

We reproduce the rotation curve of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) by taking into account its bulge, disk, and halo components, considering the last one to contain the major part of dark matter mass. Hence, our prescription is to split the galactic bulge into two components, namely, the inner and main bulges, respectively. Both bulges are thus modeled by exponential density profiles since we underline that the widely accepted de Vaucouleurs law fails to reproduce the whole galactic bulge rotation curve.</description>

The morphological classification of galaxies is considered a relevant issue and can be approached from different points of view. The increasing growth in the size and accuracy of astronomical data sets brings with it the need for the use of automatic methods to perform these classifications. The aim of this work is to propose and evaluate a method for automatic unsupervised classification of kinematic morphologies of galaxies that yields a meaningful clustering and captures the variations of the fundamental properties of galaxies.</description>

For this work we are in particular interested in the bright end of the UV LF in this redshift range. The data from \textit{XMM-Newton} Optical Monitor (XMM-OM), near-ultraviolet (1600-4000 {\AA}) observations over 1.5 deg\textsuperscript{2} of the COSMOS field are employed for this purpose.</description>

We utilise theoretical models of Population III stellar+nebular spectra to investigate the prospects of observing and accurately identifying Population III galaxies with JWST using both deep imaging and spectroscopy. We investigate a series of different colour cuts, finding that a combination of NIRCam and MIRI photometry through the F444W-F560W, F560W-F770W colours offers the most robust identifier of potential $z=8$ Pop III candidates. We calculate that NIRCam will have to reach $\sim$ 28.</description>

Two experimental methods, virtual-photon excitation by proton scattering and real-photo absorption by a high-brilliance gamma-ray beam produced by laser Compton scattering, will be applied to measure the photo-absorption cross sections and the decay branching ratio of each decay channel as a function of the photon energy.</description>

We present a photometric halo mass estimation technique for local galaxies that enables us to establish the stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation down to stellar masses of 10$^5$ M$\odot$. We find no detectable differences among the SMHM relations of four local galaxy clusters or between the cluster and field relations and we find agreement with extrapolations of previous SMHM relations derived using abundance matching approaches. We fit a power law to our empirical SMHM relation and find that for adopted NFW dark matter profiles and for M$* &amp;lt; 10^9$ M$\odot$, the halo mass is M$h = 10^{10.</description>

The detected polarized radio emission from remnant of SN1987A opens the possibility to unveil the structure of the pre-supernova magnetic field in the circumstellar medium. Properties derived from direct measurements would be of importance for understanding the progenitor stars and their magnetic fields. As the first step to this goal, we adopted the hydrodynamic data from an elaborated three-dimensional (3-D) numerical model of SN1987A. We have developed an approximate method for reconstruction&#39; of 3-D magnetic field structure inside supernova remnant on the hydrodynamic background&amp;rsquo;.</description>

Other data revealing highly dense population of the very young universe with plethora of other different types of objects are presented. It is demonstrated that similar or maybe even more pronounced problems can be seen also in the present day universe.</description>

We seek to differentiate dynamical and morphological attributes between globular clusters (GCs) that were formed inside their own dark matter (DM) mini-halo, and those who were not. We employ high resolution full N-body simulations on GPU of GCs with and without a DM mini-halo, orbiting a Fornax-like dwarf galaxy. For GCs with DM, we observe that this dark extra mass triggers a tidal radius growth that allows the mini-halo to act as a protective shield against tidal stripping, being itself stripped beforehand the stars.</description>

      <description>First author: Joshua L. Steffen
We present a comparative study of active galactic nuclei (AGN) between galaxy pairs and isolated galaxies with the final data release of the MaNGA integral field spectroscopic survey. We build a sample of 391 kinematic galaxy pairs within the footprint of the survey and select AGN using the survey&amp;rsquo;s spectra. We use the comoving volume densities of the AGN samples to quantify the effects that tidal interactions have on the triggering of nuclear accretion.</description>

It has been argued that the low-mass primordial stars ($m_{\rm Pop III}\,\leq 0.8\,M_\odot$) are likely to enter the main sequence and hence possibly be found in the present-day Galaxy. However, due to limitations in existing numerical capabilities, current three-dimensional (3D) &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;search-hit mathjax&amp;quot;&amp;gt;simulations&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; of disk fragmentation are capable of following only a few thousands of years of evolution after the formation of the first protostar. In this work we use a modified version of {\sc Gadget}-2 smoothed particle hydrodynamics(SPH) code to present the results of non-linear collapse of the gas clouds associated with various degrees of initial solid body rotation (parameterized by $β$) using a piecewise polytropic equation of state.</description>

In recent years, radio interferometric observations have achieved high accuracy in determining the absolute values of trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of maser radiation sources and radio stars. The error in determining the trigonometric parallaxes of these objects averages about 10 microarcseconds, which allows us to confidently study the geometric and kinematic properties of the distribution of stars located at great distances from the Sun, up to the center of the Galaxy.</description>

      <description>First author: Ji-Yu Song
Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences encode the absolute luminosity distances of GW sources. Once the redshifts of GW sources are known, one can use the distance-redshift relation to constrain cosmological parameters. One way to obtain the redshifts is to localize GW sources by GW observations and then use galaxy catalogs to determine redshifts from a statistical analysis of redshift information of the potential host galaxies, and such GW data are commonly referred to as dark sirens.</description>

      <description>First author: Camilla Pacifici
The study of galaxy evolution hinges on our ability to interpret multi-wavelength galaxy observations in terms of their physical properties. To do this, we rely on spectral energy distribution (SED) models which allow us to infer physical parameters from spectrophotometric data. In recent years, thanks to the wide and deep multi-waveband galaxy surveys, the volume of high quality data have significantly increased. Alongside the increased data, algorithms performing SED fitting have improved, including better modeling prescriptions, newer templates, and more extensive sampling in wavelength space.</description>

We investigate the formation channels of the intracluster light (ICL) and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in clusters at $z=0$. For this, we perform multi-resolution cosmological N-body simulations using the &amp;ldquo;Galaxy Replacement Technique&amp;rdquo; (GRT). We study the formation channels of the ICL and BCG as a function of distance from the cluster center and the dynamical state of the clusters at $z=0$. To do this, we trace back the stars of the ICL and BCG, and identify the stellar components in which they existed when they first fell into the clusters.</description>

We present the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z=2-3$ in the stellar mass range of $M_\star\approx 10^{6.5}-10^{9.5}M_\odot$ using 55 dwarf galaxies in the Abell 2744 and SMACS J0723-3732 galaxy cluster fields. These dwarf galaxies are identified and confirmed by deep JWST/NIRISS imaging and slitless grism spectroscopic observations. Taking advantage of the gravitational lensing effect, we extend the previous MZR relation at $z=2-3$ to a much lower mass regime by more than 2.</description>

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transients with large dispersion measures. The origin of FRBs is still mysterious. One of the methods to comprehend FRB origin is to probe the physical environments of FRB host galaxies. Mapping molecular-gas kinematics in FRB host galaxies is critical because it results in star formation that is likely connected to the birth of FRB progenitors. However, most previous works of FRB host galaxies have focused on its stellar component.</description>

The rapidly increasing statistical power of cosmological imaging surveys requires us to reassess the regime of validity for various approximations that accelerate the calculation of relevant theoretical predictions. In this paper, we present the results of the &amp;lsquo;N5K non-Limber integration challenge&amp;rsquo;, the goal of which was to quantify the performance of different approaches to calculating the angular power spectrum of galaxy number counts and cosmic shear data without invoking the so-called &amp;lsquo;Limber approximation&amp;rsquo;, in the context of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).</description>

The PHANGS collaboration has been building a reference dataset for the multi-scale, multi-phase study of star formation and the interstellar medium in nearby galaxies. With the successful launch and commissioning of JWST, we can now obtain high-resolution infrared imaging to probe the youngest stellar populations and dust emission on the scales of star clusters and molecular clouds ($\sim$5-50 pc). In Cycle 1, PHANGS is conducting an 8-band imaging survey from 2-21$\mu$m of 19 nearby spiral galaxies.</description>

      <description>Georg Herzog
We examine the gas content of field dwarf galaxies in a high-resolution cosmological simulation. In agreement with previous work, we find that galaxies inhabiting dark matter haloes with mass below a critical value, $M_{200} \lesssim M_{\rm crit} \approx 5\times 10^{9} \ M_{\odot}$, are quiescent at the present day. The gas content of these galaxies is thus insensitive to feedback from evolving stars. Almost half of these quiescent systems today have gas masses much smaller than that expected for their mass.</description>

      <description>First author: Rachel J. Bruch
Spectroscopic detection of transient narrow emission lines (flash-ionisation features) traces the presence of circumstellar material (CSM) around massive stars exploding as core-collapse supernovae. Transient emission lines disappearing shortly after the SN explosion suggest that the spatial extent of this material is compact; hence implying that the progenitor star experienced episodes of enhanced mass loss shortly prior to explosion. The early light curves of Type II supernovae (SNe II) are assumed to be initially powered by shock-cooling emission.</description>

We adopt a resolved stellar feedback model with non-equilibrium cooling and heating, including photoelectric heating and photo-ionizing radiation, as well as supernovae (SNe), coupled to the second order meshless finite mass (MFM) method for hydrodynamics.</description>

Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) are a rare class of stellar explosions whose progenitor systems are not yet well determined. We present and analyze observations of the Type Ibn SN 2019kbj, and model its light curve in order to constrain its progenitor and explosion parameters. SN 2019kbj shows roughly constant temperature during the first month after peak, indicating a power source (likely CSM interaction) that keeps the continuum emission hot at ~15000K.</description>

Early galaxies were the radiation source for reionization, with the photoheating feedback from the reionization process expected to reduce the efficiency of star formation in low mass haloes. Hence, to fully understand reionization and galaxy formation, we must study their impact on each other. The THESAN project has so far aimed to study the impact of galaxy formation physics on reionization, but here we present the new THESAN simulations with a factor 50 higher resolution ($m_{\rm b} \approx 10^4$~M$\odot$) that aim to self-consistently study the back-reaction of reionization on galaxies.</description>

We perform three-dimensional simulations of magnetorotational supernovae using a $39,M_{\odot}$ progenitor star with two different initial magnetic field strengths of $10^{10}$ G and $10^{12}$ G in the core. Both models rapidly undergo shock revival and their explosion energies asymptote within a few hundred milliseconds to values of $\gtrsim 2\times10^{51}$ erg after conservatively correcting for the binding energy of the envelope. Magnetically collimated, non-relativistic jets form in both models, though the jets are subject to non-axisymmetric instabilities.</description>

Double radio lobes are generally believed to be produced by active nuclei of elliptical galaxies. However, several double-lobed radio sources have been solidly found to be associated with spiral galaxies. By cross-matching $\sim9\times10^5$ spiral galaxies selected from the SDSS DR8 data with the full 1.4-GHz radio source catalogs of NVSS and FIRST, we identify three new spiral galaxies: J0326$-$0623, J1110+0321 and J1134+3046 that produce double radio lobes, in addition to five double-lobed spirals previously known.</description>

Dual AGN are important for understanding galaxy-merger-triggered fueling of black holes and hierarchical growth of structures. The least explored type of dual AGN are those associated with mergers of two dwarf galaxies. According to observations and cosmological simulations, dwarf galaxies are the most abundant type of galaxies in the early Universe and the galaxy merger rate is dominated by dwarfs. However, these mergers are generally too distant to be directly observed, and low-redshift dwarf-dwarf merger-related dual AGN are notoriously hard to find.</description>

      <description>First author: Koshy George
Spiral galaxies undergo strong ram-pressure effects when they fall into the galaxy cluster potential. As a consequence, their gas is stripped to form extended tails within which star formation can happen, giving them the typical jellyfish appearance. The ultraviolet imaging observations of jellyfish galaxies provide an opportunity to understand ongoing star formation in the stripped tails. We report the ultraviolet observations of the jellyfish galaxies JW39, JO60, JO194 and compare with observations in optical continuum and $\mathrm{H}{\alpha}$.</description>

Globular clusters contain multiple stellar populations, with some previous generation of stars polluting the current stars with heavier elements. Understanding the history of globular clusters is helpful in understanding how galaxies merged and evolved and therefore constraining the site or sites of this historic pollution is a priority. The acceptable temperature and density conditions of these polluting sites depend on critical &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;search-hit mathjax&amp;quot;&amp;gt;reaction&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; rates. In this paper, three experimental studies helping to constrain astrophysically important &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;search-hit mathjax&amp;quot;&amp;gt;reaction&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; rates are briefly discussed.</description>

We use physics informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the radiative transfer equation and calculate a synthetic spectrum for a Type Ia supernova (SN~Ia) SN 2011fe. The calculation is based on local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and 9 elements are included. Physical processes included are approximate radiative equilibrium, bound-bound transitions, and the Doppler effect. A PINN based gamma-ray scattering approximation is used for radioactive decay energy deposition. The PINN synthetic spectrum is compared to an observed spectrum, a synthetic spectrum calculated by the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer program TARDIS, and the formal solution of the radiative transfer equation.</description>

The Universe expansion rate is modulated around local inhomogeneities due to their gravitational potential. Velocity waves are then observed around galaxy clusters in the Hubble diagram. This paper studies them in a ~738 Mpc wide, with 2048^3 particles, cosmological simulation of our cosmic environment (a.k.a. CLONE: Constrained LOcal &amp;amp; Nesting Environment Simulation). For the first time, the simulation shows that velocity waves that arise in the lines-of-sight of the most massive dark matter halos agree with those observed in local galaxy velocity catalogs in the lines-of-sight of Coma and several other local (Abell) clusters.</description>

We develop a novel general formalism allowing us to obtain values of the Hubble constant in agreement with late-time observables without degrading the fit to Cosmic Microwave Background data, considering perturbative modifications around a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Taking as proof-of-principle the case of a time-varying electron mass and fine structure constant, we demonstrate that a modified recombination can solve the Hubble tension and lower $S_8$ to match weak lensing measurements.</description>
