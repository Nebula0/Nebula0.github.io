We present deep L-Band observations of the equatorial field centered on the z=6.3 SDSS QSO, reaching a 1 sigma sensitivity of ~2.5 uJy at the center of the field. We extracted a catalog of 1489 radio sources down to a flux density of ~12.5 uJy (5 sigma) over a field of view of ~ 30&amp;rsquo; diameter. We derived the source counts accounting for catalog reliability and completeness, and compared them with others available in the literature.</description>

      <description>First author: Guido Roberts-Borsani
The appearance of galaxies over the first billion years after the Big Bang is believed to be responsible for the last dramatic change in the state of the Universe. Ultraviolet photons from galaxies within this time period - the Epoch of Reionization - ionized intergalactic Hydrogen, rendering the Universe transparent to UV radiation and ending the so-called cosmic Dark Ages, sometime after redshift $z\sim8$. The majority of ionizing photons in the first few hundred Myrs of cosmic history are thought to derive from galaxies significantly fainter than the characteristic luminosity $L^{}$.</description>

      <description>First author: Laura A. Hayes
We report the detection of a significant ionospheric disturbance in the D-region of Earth&amp;rsquo;s ionosphere which was associated with the massive gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A that occurred on October 9 2022. We identified the disturbance over northern Europe - a result of the increased ionisation by X- and gamma-ray emission from the GRB - using very low frequency (VLF) radio waves as a probe of the D-region.</description>

      <description>First author: Y. Díaz
An interesting feature in active galactic nuclei (AGN) accreting at low rate is the weakness of the reflection features in their X-ray spectra, which can result from the gradual disappearance of the torus with decreasing accretion rates. It has been suggested that low luminosity AGN (LLAGN) would have a different reflector configuration compared with high luminosity AGN, either covering a smaller fraction of the sky or simply having less material.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Archeological Record: Further Evidence for Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray Acceleration in Starburst-Driven Superwinds</title>

      <description>First author: Luis Alfredo Anchordoqui
Very recently, the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array collaborations reported strong evidence for a correlation between the highest energy cosmic rays and nearby starburst galaxies, with a global significance post-trial of $4.6\sigma$. It is well known that the collective effect of supernovae and winds from massive stars in the central region of these galaxies drives a galactic-scale superwind that can shock heat and accelerate ambient interstellar or circumgalactic gas.</description>

      <description>First author: Daniel Ceverino
The evolution of star-forming galaxies at high redshifts is very sensitive to the strength and nature of stellar feedback. Using two sets of cosmological, zoom-in simulations from the VELA suite, we compare the effects of two different models of feedback: with and without kinetic feedback. At a fixed halo mass and redshift, the stellar mass is reduced by a factor of 1-3 in the models with stronger feedback, so the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation is in better agreement with abundance matching results.</description>

      <description>First author: Rolf Schlichenmaier
The imaging spectro-polarimeter VTF (Visible Tunable Filter) will be operated at the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). Due to its capability of resolving dynamic fine structure of smaller than 0.05&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, the finite acquisition time of typically 11 s affects the measurement process and potentially causes errors in deduced physical parameters. We estimate those errors and investigate ways of minimising them. We mimic the solar surface using a magneto-hydrodynamic simulation with a spatially averaged vertical field strength of 200 G.</description>

      <description>First author: João Rino-Silvestre
Dust is a major component of the interstellar medium. Through scattering, absorption and thermal re-emission, it can profoundly alter astrophysical observations. Models for dust composition and distribution are necessary to better understand and curb their impact on observations. A new approach for serial and computationally inexpensive production of such models is here presented. Traditionally these models are studied with the help of radiative transfer modelling, a critical tool to understand the impact of dust attenuation and reddening on the observed properties of galaxies and active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>First author: Ch. Rab
Winds in protoplanetary disks play an important role in their evolution and dispersal. However, what physical process is driving the winds is still unclear (i.e. magnetically vs thermally driven), and can only be understood by directly confronting theoretical models with observational data. We use hydrodynamic photoevaporative disk wind models and post-process them with a thermo-chemical model to produce synthetic observables for the o-H$_2$ at 2.12 micron and [OI] at 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Adrian E. Bayer
Reconstructing the initial conditions of the Universe from late-time observations has the potential to optimally extract cosmological information. Due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space, a differentiable forward model is needed for convergence, and recent advances have made it possible to perform reconstruction with nonlinear models based on galaxy (or halo) positions. In addition to positions, future surveys will provide measurements of galaxies&amp;rsquo; peculiar velocities through the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich effect (kSZ), type Ia supernovae, and the fundamental plane or Tully-Fisher relations.</description>

We investigate the kinematic properties of gas and galaxies in the Local Group (LG) using high-resolution simulations performed by the {\sc Hestia} (High-resolution Environmental Simulations of The Immediate Area) collaboration. Our simulations include the correct cosmography surrounding LG-like regions consisting of two main spiral galaxies of $\sim 10^{12}$~M$_\odot$, their satellites and minor isolated galaxies, all sharing the same large-scale motion within a volume of a few Mpc.</description>

      <description>First author: Ottavio Fornieri
Cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion is the result of the interaction of such charged particles against magnetic fluctuations. These fluctuations originate from large-scale turbulence cascading towards smaller spatial scales, decomposed into three different modes, as described by $magneto-hydro-dynamics$ (MHD) theory. As a consequence, the description of particle diffusion strongly depends on the model describing the injected turbulence. Moreover, the amount of energy assigned to each of the three modes is in general not equally divided, which implies that diffusion properties might be different from one region to another.</description>

      <description>First author: Adam Hutchinson
Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) acceleration and injection into interplanetary space during gradual SEP events is thought to take place at Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)-driven shocks. Features of measured intensity profiles at 1 au have been attributed to properties of the radial and longitudinal/latitudinal injections at the shock. Focussed transport models are typically used to model acceleration at a CME-shock and subsequent propagation. Test particle simulations are an alternative approach but so far they have been carried out only with instantaneous injection near the Sun.</description>

      <description>First author: Kohta Murase
We discuss implications that can be obtained by searches for neutrinos from the brightest gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A. We derive constraints on GRB model parameters such as the cosmic-ray loading factor and dissipation radius, taking into account both neutrino spectra and effective areas. The results are strong enough to constrain proton acceleration near the photosphere, and we find that the single burst limits are comparable to those from stacking analysis.</description>

      <description>First author: Nikolay Shakura
We revisit the modal analysis of small perturbations in Keplerian ideal gas flows with constant vertical magnetic field leading to magneto-rotational instability (MRI) using the non-local approach. In the general case, MRI modes are described by a Schr&amp;quot;odinger-like differential equation with some effective potential including &amp;lsquo;repulsive&amp;rsquo; ($1/r^2$) and &amp;lsquo;attractive&amp;rsquo; ($-1/r^3$) terms and are quantized. In shallow potentials, there are no stationary &amp;rsquo;energy levels&amp;rsquo;. In thin Keplerian accretion discs, the perturbation wavelengths $\lambda=2\pi/k_z$ are smaller than the disc semi-thickness $h$ only in &amp;lsquo;deep&amp;rsquo; potential wells.</description>

We investigate the properties of globular clusters in a galaxy cluster, using the particle tagging method with a semi-analytical approach in a cosmological context. We assume globular clusters form from dark matter halo mergers and their metallicity is assigned based on the stellar mass of the host dark matter halos and the formation redshift of GCs. Dynamical evolution and disruption of globular clusters are considered using semi-analytical approaches, controlled by several free parameters.</description>

The presence of the magnetic field is critical to transport energy through the solar atmosphere. The new generation of telescopes will provide new insight into how the magnetic field arrives into the chromosphere and its role in the energy balance of the solar atmosphere. We have used a 3D radiative MHD numerical model of the solar atmosphere with high spatial resolution (4~km) calculated with the Bifrost code.</description>

      <description>First author: Jens Chluba
In this paper, we formulate a generalised photon Boltzmann hierarchy that allows us to model the evolution and creation of spectral distortion anisotropies in the early Universe. We directly build on our first paper in this series, extending the thermalisation Green&amp;rsquo;s function treatment to the anisotropic case. We show that the problem can be described with the common Boltzmann hierarchy for the photon field extended by new spectral parameters &amp;ndash; a step that reduces the complexity of the calculation by at least two orders of magnitude.</description>

We study the effect of super-sample covariance (SSC) on the power spectrum and higher-order statistics: bispectrum, halo mass function, and void size function. We also investigate the effect of SSC on the cross-covariance between the statistics. We consider both the matter and halo fields. Higher-order statistics of the large-scale structure contain additional cosmological information beyond the power spectrum and are a powerful tool to constrain cosmology.</description>

The spatial distribution of elemental abundances and their time evolution are among the major constraints to disentangle the scenarios of formation and evolution of the Galaxy. We used the sample of open clusters available in the final release of the Gaia-ESO survey to trace the Galactic radial abundance and abundance to iron ratio gradients, and their time evolution. We selected member stars in 62 open clusters, with ages from 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Adam Hutchinson
Corotation of particle-filled magnetic flux tubes is generally thought to have a minor influence on the time-intensity profiles of gradual Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events. For this reason many models solve the focussed transport equation within the corotating frame, thus neglecting corotation effects. We study the effects of corotation on gradual SEP intensity profiles at a range of observer longitudinal positions relative to the solar source.</description>

NASA&amp;rsquo;s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission promises to improve our understanding of hot Jupiters by providing an all-sky, magnitude-limited sample of transiting hot Jupiters suitable for population studies. Assembling such a sample requires confirming hundreds of planet candidates with additional follow-up observations.

      <description>First author: L. Tsaloukidis
In agreement with the constantly increasing gravitational wave events, new aspects of the internal structure of compact stars can be considered. A scenario in which a first order transition takes place inside these stars is of particular interest as it can lead, under conditions, to a third gravitationally stable branch (besides white dwarfs and neutron stars), the twin stars. The new branch yields stars with the same mass as normal compact stars but quite different radii.</description>

      <description>First author: Debraj Kundu
Recent observations of several massive pulsars, with masses near and above $2~M_\odot$, point towards the existence of matter at very high densities, compared to normal matter that we are familiar with in our terrestrial world. This leads to the possibility of appearance of exotic degrees of freedom other than nucleons inside the core of the neutrons stars (NS). Another significant property of NSs is the presence of high surface magnetic field, with highest range of the order of $\sim~10^{16}$ G.</description>

      <description>First author: Maximilian Stritzinger
We present a multi-band sequence of $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ images documenting the emergence and evolution of multiple light echoes (LEs) linked to the stripped-envelope supernova (SN) 2016adj located in the central dust-lane of Centaurus A. Following point-spread function subtraction, we identify the earliest LE emission associated with a SN at only $+$34 days (d) past the epoch of $B$-band maximum. Additional HST images extending through $+$578 d cover the evolution of LE1 taking the form of a ring, while images taken on $+$1991 d reveals not only LE1, but also segments of a new inner LE ring (LE2) as well as two additional outer LE rings (LE3 &amp;amp; LE4).</description>

      <description>First author: Daiki Yamasaki
The solar active region NOAA 12887 produced a strong X1.0 flare on 2021 October 28, which exhibits X-shaped flare ribbons and a circle-shaped erupting filament. To understand the eruption process with these characteristics, we conducted a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamics simulation using a nonlinear force-free field of the active region about an hour before the flare as the initial condition. Our simulation reproduces the filament eruption observed in the Ha images of GONG and the 304 angstrom images of SDO/AIA and suggests that two mechanisms can possibly contribute to the magnetic eruption.</description>

The observation of the polarised emission from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from future ground-based and satellite-borne experiments holds the promise of indirectly detecting the elusive signal from primordial tensor fluctuations in the form of large-scale $B$-mode polarisation. Doing so, however, requires an accurate and robust separation of the signal from polarised Galactic foregrounds. We present a component separation method for multi-frequency CMB observations that combines some of the advantages of map-based and power-spectrum-based techniques, and which is direcly applicable to data in the presence of realistic foregrounds and instrumental noise.</description>

We discovered it by cross-matching the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) radio catalog at 1.4 GHz with the first data release of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS PS1) in the optical. With a NVSS flux density of 74.2 mJy, PSO J191$+$86 is one of the brightest radio QSO discovered at z$\sim$5.</description>

Gravitational microlensing has the potential to provide direct gravitational masses of single, free-floating brown dwarfs, independent of evolutionary and atmospheric models. The proper motions and parallaxes of nearby brown dwarfs can be used to predict close future alignments with distant background stars that cause a microlensing event. Targeted astrometric follow up of the predicted microlensing events permits the brown dwarf&amp;rsquo;s mass to be measured. Predicted microlensing events are typically found via searching for a peak threshold signal using an estimate of the lens mass.</description>

Massive black holes in the centers of galaxies today must have grown by several orders of magnitude from seed black holes formed at early times. Detecting a population of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) can provide constraints on these elusive BH seeds. Here we use the large volume, cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Astrid, which includes IMBH seeds and dynamical friction to investigate the population of IMBH seeds.</description>

      <description>First author: Claudia Toci
In order to understand which mechanism is responsible for accretion in protoplanetary discs, a robust knowledge of the observed disc radius using gas tracers such as $^{12}$CO and other CO isotopologues is pivotal. Indeed, the two main theories proposed, viscous accretion and wind-driven accretion, predict different time evolution for the disc radii. In this Letter, we present an analytical solution for the evolution of the disc radii in viscously evolving protoplanetary discs using $^{12}$CO as a tracer, under the assumption that the $^{12}$CO radius is the radius where the surface density of the disc is equal to the threshold for CO photo-dissociation.</description>

Circumstellar discs around Be stars are formed by the material ejected by the central star. This process removes excess angular momentum from the star as viscosity facilitates the mass and angular momentum transfer within the disc and its growth. The angular momentum loss rates (AMLR) of Be stars is a subject of debate in the literature. Through the modelling of the disc formation and dissipation phases observed from Be stars, their average AMLR can be determined and this is the goal of this work.</description>

We derive a new Deconvolved Distribution Estimator that combines the useful properties of these two methods into one statistic.</description>

Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is one of the systematic challenges preventing 21cm interferometric instruments from detecting the Epoch of Reionization. To mitigate the effects of RFI on data analysis pipelines, numerous inpaint techniques have been developed to restore RFI corrupted data. We examine the qualitative and quantitative errors introduced into the visibilities and power spectrum due to inpainting. We perform our analysis on simulated data as well as real data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) Phase 1 upper limits.</description>

Cosmic variance limits the accuracy of cosmological N-body simulations, introducing bias in statistics such as the power spectrum, halo mass function, or the cosmic shear. We provide new methods to measure and reduce the effect of cosmic variance in existing and new simulations. We run pairs of simulations using phase shifted initial conditions with matching amplitudes. We set the initial amplitudes of the Fourier modes to ensure that the average power spectrum of the pair is equal to the cosmic mean power spectrum from linear theory.</description>

In this work, we demonstrate a method of constraining the orientation of the minor axis of the DM halo using the angle and frequency variables. This method is complementary to other traditional techniques, such as orbit fitting.</description>

Galaxies often contain large reservoirs of molecular gas which shape their evolution. This can be through cooling of the gas &amp;ndash; which leads to star formation, or accretion onto the central supermassive black hole &amp;ndash; which fuels AGN activity and produces powerful feedback. Molecular gas has been detected in early-type galaxies on scales of just a few tens to hundreds of solar masses by searching for absorption against their compact radio cores.</description>

Magnetic field extrapolation is a fundamental tool to reconstruct the three-dimensional solar coronal magnetic field. However, the prevalently used force-free field model might not be applicable in the lower atmosphere, where plasma \b{eta} is greater than 1. In this work, we perform extrapolation in active region 12158, based on an updated magnetohydrostatic (MHS) method. By comparing the results with those from the force-free field method of Current-Field Iteration in Spherical Coordinates (CFITS), we find that the overall properties, which are characterized by the magnetic free energy and helicity, are roughly the same after volume integral.</description>

Cosmological simulations show that dark matter halos surrounding baryonic disks have a wide range of angular momenta, measured by the spin parameter ($\lambda$). In this study, we bring out the importance of inner angular momentum($&amp;lt;$30 kpc), measured in terms of the halo spin parameter, on the secular evolution of the bar using N-body simulations. We have varied the halo spin parameter $\lambda$ from 0 to 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Selma Benseguane
The observation of pits at the surface of comets offers the opportunity to take a glimpse into the properties and the mechanisms that shape a nucleus through cometary activity. If the origin of these pits is still a matter of debate, multiple studies have recently suggested that known phase transitions alone could not have carved these morphological features on the surface of 67P/C-G. We want to understand how the progressive modification of 67P&amp;rsquo;s surface due to cometary activity might have affected the characteristics of pits.</description>

We present a first systematic time series study of a sample of blazars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite $\textit{TESS}$ spacecraft. By cross matching the positions of the sources in the TESS observations with those from Roma-BZCAT, 29 blazars including both BL Lacerate objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars were identified. The observation lengths of the 79 light curves of the sources, across all sectors on which the targets of interest have been observed by $\textit{TESS}$, range between 21.</description>

We investigate archival Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC F140LP observations of NGC~1399 to search for evidence of multiple stellar populations in extragalactic globular clusters. Enhanced FUV populations are thought to be indicators of He-enhanced second generation populations in globular clusters, specifically extreme/blue horizontal branch stars. Out of 149 globular clusters in the field of view, 58 have far ultraviolet (FUV) counterparts with magnitudes brighter than 28.</description>

      <description>First author: Léo Vacher
The change of physical conditions across the turbulent and magnetized interstellar medium (ISM) induces a 3D spatial variation of the properties of Galactic polarized emission. The observed signal results from the averaging of different spectral energy distributions (SED) and polarization angles, along and between lines of sight. As a consequence, the total Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ will have different distorted SEDs, so that the polarization angle becomes frequency dependent.</description>

For example, Adams et al. identified the candidate ID 1514 with $\log_{10}(M_{}/M_{\odot}) = {9.8}{-0.2}^{+0.2}$ located at $z{\mathrm{phot}} = 9.85_{-0.12}^{+0.18}$ and Naidu et al. found even more distant candidates labeled as GL-z11 and GL-z13 with $\log_{10}(M_{}/M_{\odot}) = 9.</description>

Broad emitting line regions (BLR) in active galaxies are primarily emitted by photoionization processes that are driven by the incident continuum arising from the underlying, complex geometrical structure, i.e. accretion disk and corona around a supermassive black hole. Modelling the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) effective in ionizing the gas-rich BLR is key to understanding the various radiative processes at play and their importance that eventually leads to the emission of emission lines from diverse physical conditions.</description>

Nyx is a nearby, prograde, and high-eccentricity stellar stream physically contained in the thick disk but with an unknown origin. Nyx could be the remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, in which case the associated dark matter substructure could affect terrestrial dark matter direct detection experiments. Alternatively, Nyx could be a signature of the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s disk formation and evolution. To determine the origin of Nyx, we obtained high-resolution spectroscopy of 34 Nyx stars using Keck/HIRES and Magellan/MIKE.</description>

Interstellar objects (ISOs) are fascinating and under-explored celestial objects, providing physical laboratories to understand the formation of our solar system and probe the composition and properties of material formed in exoplanetary systems. This paper will discuss the accessibility of and mission design to ISOs with varying characteristics, including a discussion of state covariance estimation over the course of a cruise, handoffs from traditional navigation approaches to novel autonomous navigation for fast flyby regimes, and overall recommendations about preparing for the future in situ exploration of these targets.</description>

In recent years, many questions have arisen regarding the chemistry of photochemical products in the carbon-rich winds of evolved stars. To address them, it is imperative to constrain the distributions of such species through high angular resolution interferometric observations covering multiple rotational transitions. We used archival ALMA observations to map rotational lines involving high energy levels of cyanoacetylene (HC$_3$N) toward the inner envelope (radius &amp;lt;8&amp;quot;/1000 AU) of the carbon star IRC+10216.</description>

The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory~(LHAASO) is one of the most sensitive gamma-ray detector arrays, whose ultrahigh-energy~(UHE) work bands not only help to study the origin and acceleration mechanism of UHE cosmic rays, but also provide the opportunity to test fundamental physics concepts such as Lorentz symmetry. LHAASO directly observes the $1.42~\mathrm{PeV}$ highest-energy photon. By adopting the synchrotion self-Compton model LHAASO also suggests that the $1.</description>

Gamma-ray burst GRB 211211A may have been the result of a neutron star merger at $\approx350$ Mpc. However, none of the LIGO-Virgo detectors were operating at the time. We show that the gravitational-wave signal from a \grb-like binary neutron star inspiral in the next LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O4) would be below the conventional detection threshold, however a coincident gamma-ray burst observation would provide necessary information to claim a statistically-significant multimessenger observation.</description>

We analyse the characteristics of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) during Solar Cycles 23 and 24. The present analysis is primarily based on the near-Earth ICME catalogue (Richardson and Cane, 2010). An important aspect of this study is to understand the near-Earth and geoeffective aspects of ICMEs in terms of their association (type II ICMEs) versus absence (non-type II ICMEs) of decameter-hectometer (DH) type II radio bursts, detected by Wind/WAVES and STEREOS/WAVES.</description>

Aims. We wish to establish a firm link between jet simulations and analytical studies of magnetically-driven steady-state jets from Keplerian accretion disks. In particular, the latter have predicted the existence of recollimation shocks due to the dominant hoop-stress, so far never observed in platform simulations. Methods. We perform a set of axisymmetric MHD simulations of non-relativistic jets using the PLUTO code. The simulations are designed to reproduce the boundary conditions generally expected in analytical studies.</description>

(abridged)Multiple systems for which the astrometric and spectroscopic orbit are known offer the unique possibility of determining the distance to these systems directly without any assumptions. They are therefore ideal objects for a comparison of Gaia data release 3 (GDR3) parallax data, especially since GDR3 presents the results of the non-single star (NSS) analysis that potentially results in improved parallaxes. An sample of 192 orbital parallax determinations for 186 systems is compiled from the literature.</description>

We measure 20 elements and find differential measurement uncertainties on the order 0.01-0.02 dex in both clusters.</description>

We construct a three-dimensional and redshift-evolutionary X-ray and ultraviolet ($L_X-L_{UV}$) luminosity relation for quasars from the powerful statistic tool called copula, and find that the constructed $L_X-L_{UV}$ relation from copula is more viable than the standard one and the observations favor the redshift-evolutionary relation more than $3\sigma$. The Akaike and Bayes information criterions indicate that the quasar data support strongly the three-dimensional $L_X-L_{UV}$ relation. Our results show that the quasars can be regarded as a reliable indicator of the cosmic distance if the $L_X-L_{UV}$ relation from copula is used to calibrate quasar data.</description>

Shell stars, in particular the cooler ones, often do not show conspicuous Balmer-line emission and may consequently be missed in surveys that specifically search for emission signatures in the Halpha line. The present work is aimed at identifying stars with shell-signatures via a search for strong FeII multiplet 42 lines at 4924, 5018, 5169A in archival LAMOST spectra. Candidates were selected by probing the FeII 42 lines in the spectra of a sample of colour-preselected early-type stars using a modified version of the MKCLASS code and then categorised by visual inspection of their spectra.</description>

One of the important discoveries made by Voyager-2 is the nonadiabatic radial profile of the solar wind proton temperature. This phenomenon has been studied for several decades. The dissipation of turbulence energy has been proposed as the main physical process responsible for the temperature profile. The turbulence is both convected with the solar wind and originated in the solar wind by the compressions and shears in the flows and by pick-up ions.</description>

We study the spherical collapse of non-top-hat matter fluctuations in the presence of dark energy with arbitrary sound speed. The model is described by a system of partial differential equations solved using a pseudo-spectral method with collocation points. This method can reproduce the known analytical solutions in the linear regime with an accuracy better than $10^{-6}%$ and better than $10^{-2}%$ for the virialization threshold given by the usual spherical collapse model.</description>

Coherent radio emission via electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) from hot magnetic stars was discovered more than two decades ago, but the physical conditions that make the generation of ECME favourable remain uncertain. Only recently was an empirical relation, connecting ECME luminosity with the stellar magnetic field and temperature, proposed to explain what makes a hot magnetic star capable of producing ECME. This relation was, however, obtained with just fourteen stars.</description>

      <description>First author: Dongwoo T. Chung
We present the deconvolved distribution estimator (DDE), an extension of the voxel intensity distribution (VID), in the context of future observations proposed as part of the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP). The DDE exploits the fact that the observed VID is a convolution of correlated signal intensity distributions and uncorrelated noise or interloper intensity distributions. By deconvolving the individual VID of two observables away from their joint VID in a Fourier-space operation, the DDE suppresses sensitivity to interloper emission while maintaining sensitivity to correlated components.</description>

Should Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) exist in nature, they would inevitably accrete baryonic matter in their vicinity. In turn, the consequent emission of high-energy radiation could affect the thermal history of the universe to an extent that can be probed with a number of cosmological observables such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. However, our understanding of the accretion and radiation emission processes in the context of PBHs is still in its infancy, and very large theoretical uncertainties affect the resulting constraints on the PBH abundance.</description>

Red supergiants (RSGs) are evolved massive stars in a stage preceding core-collapse supernova. The physical processes that trigger mass loss in their atmospheres are still not fully understood. Based on observations of $\alpha$ Ori, a new semi-empirical method to add a wind to hydrostatic model atmospheres of RSGs was recently developed. We use this method of adding a wind to a MARCS model atmosphere to compute synthetic observables, comparing the model to spatially resolved interferometric observations.</description>

The high-cadence survey of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has completely dominated the discovery of tidal disruption events (TDEs) in the past few years and resulted in the largest sample of TDEs with optical/UV light curves well-sampled around their peaks, providing us an excellent opportunity to construct a peak luminosity function (LF) of tidal disruption flares (TDFs). The new construction is necessary particularly considering that the most updated LF reported in literature has been inferred from only 13 sources from 5 different surveys.</description>

Populating the exoplanet mass-radius diagram in order to identify the underlying relationship that governs planet composition is driving an interdisciplinary effort within the exoplanet community. The discovery of hot super-Earths - a high temperature, short-period subset of the super-Earth planet population - has presented many unresolved questions concerning the formation, evolution, and composition of rocky planets. We report the discovery of a transiting, ultra-short period hot super-Earth orbiting TOI-1075 (TIC 351601843), a nearby ($d$ = 61.</description>

In this study we present the results of a five-year follow-up campaign of the long-lived type IIn supernova SN 2017hcc, found in a spiral dwarf host of near-solar metallicity. The long rise time (57 $\pm$ 2 days, ATLAS $o$ band) and high luminosity (peaking at $-$20.78 $\pm$ 0.01 mag in the ATLAS $o$ band) point towards an interaction of massive ejecta with massive and dense circumstellar material (CSM).</description>

Deriving oxygen abundances from the electron temperature (hereafter the $T_e$-method) is the gold-standard for extragalactic metallicity studies. However, unresolved temperature fluctuations in HII regions can bias metallicity estimates low, with a magnitude that depends on the underlying and typically unknown temperature distribution. Using a toy model, we confirm that computing $T_e$-based metallicities using the temperature derived from the [O III] $\lambda$4363/$\lambda$5007 ratio (&amp;lsquo;ratio temperature&amp;rsquo;; $T_{\rm ratio}$) results in an underprediction of metallicity when temperature fluctuations are present.</description>

Abrupt and permanent photospheric magnetic field changes have been observed in many flares. It is believed that such changes are related to the reconfiguration of magnetic field lines, however, the real origin is still unclear. In this study we analyze 37 flares to understand the magnetic field vector changes in the photosphere using high-cadence (135 s) vector magnetograms obtained from the HMI/SDO. We also co-align these magnetogram sequences with flare ribbon images (1600 \AA), obtained from the AIA/SDO, to understand how the field change is associated with the ribbon morphology.</description>

The process of accretion in classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) has been observed to vary on different timescales. Studying this variability is vital to understanding a star&amp;rsquo;s evolution and provides insight into the complex processes at work within. Understanding the dichotomy between continuum veiling and emission line veiling is integral to accurately measuring the amount of veiling present in stellar spectra. Here, 15 roughly consecutive nights of optical spectroscopic data from the spectropolarimeter ESPaDOnS are utilised to characterise the short-term accretion activity in the CTTS, RU Lup, and investigate its relationship with the veiling in the LiI 6707A absorption line.</description>

The technological progress in spatial-light modulators (SLM) technology has made it possible to use those devices as programmable active focal-plane phase coronagraphic masks, opening the door to novel versatile and adaptive high-contrast imaging observation strategies. However, the scalar nature of the SLM-induced phase response is a potential hurdle when applying the approach to wideband light, as is typical in astronomical imaging. For the first time, we present laboratory results with broadband light (up to ~12pc bandwidth) for two commercially-available SLM devices used as active focal-plane phase masks in the visible regime (640 nm).</description>

In certain cases of astronomical data analysis, the meaningful physical quantity to extract is the ratio $R$ between two data sets. Examples include the lensing ratio, the interloper rate in spectroscopic redshift samples, the decay rate of gravitational potential and $E_G$ to test gravity. However, simply taking the ratio of the two data sets is biased, since it renders (even statistical) errors in the denominator into systematic errors in $R$.</description>

Long-term studies of binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) provide precise tests of strong-field gravity and can be used to measure neutron-star masses. PSR~J1909$-$3744, a binary MSP has been the subject of several pulsar timing analyses. The edge-on orbit enables measurement of its mass using the Shapiro delay; however, there is degeneracy in the sense of the inclination angle, $i$, and multiple solutions for the longitude of ascending node, $\Omega$.</description>

The Milky Way as well as external galaxies possess a thick disc. However, the dynamical role of the (geometrically) thick disc on the bar formation and evolution is not fully understood. Here, we investigate the effect of thick discs in bar formation and evolution by means of a suite of $N$-body models of (kinematically cold) thin-(kinematically hot) thick discs. We systematically vary the mass fraction of the thick disc, the thin-to-thick disc scale length ratio as well as thick disc&amp;rsquo;s scale height to examine the bar formation under diverse dynamical scenarios.</description>

However, the detection of extraterrestrial life, in our Solar System and beyond, is sufficiently challenging that it is likely that multiple measurements and approaches, spanning disciplines and missions, will be needed to make a convincing claim.</description>

Recent theoretical studies predict that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around low-redshift, $\sim L_{\ast}$ galaxies could have substantial nonthermal pressure support in the form of cosmic rays. However, these predictions are sensitive to the specific model of cosmic-ray transport employed, which is theoretically and observationally underconstrained. In this work, we propose a novel observational constraint for calculating the lower limit of the radially-averaged, effective cosmic-ray transport rate, $\kappa_{\rm min}^{\rm eff}$.</description>

Tensions between cosmological parameters (in particular the local expansion rate $H_0$ and the amplitude of matter clustering $S_8$) inferred from low-redshift data and data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS) experiments have inspired many extensions to the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Models which simultaneously lessen both tensions are of particular interest. We consider one scenario with the potential for such a resolution, in which some fraction of the dark matter has converted into dark radiation since the release of the CMB.</description>

In this work, we use muon bundles which are formed in extensive air showers and detected at the ground level as a tool for searching anisotropy of high energy cosmic rays. Such choice is explained by the penetrating ability of muons which allows them to retain the direction of primary particles with a good accuracy. In 2012-2022, we performed long-term muon bundle detection with the coordinate-tracking detector DECOR, which is a part of the Experimental complex NEVOD (MEPhI, Moscow).</description>

It is currently unknown if neutron stars are composed of nucleons only or are hybrid stars, i.e., in addition to nucleonic crusts and outer cores, they also possess quark cores. Quantum chromodynamics allows for such a phase transition possibility, but accurate calculations in the range of interest for compact stars are still elusive. Here we investigate some crust-breaking aspects of hybrid stars. We show that the crust-breaking orbital/gravitational wave frequency and maximum ellipticity are sensitive to the quark-hadron density jump and equation of state stiffness.</description>

The HR 8799 system hosts four massive planets orbiting 15 and 80 AU. Studies of the system&amp;rsquo;s orbital stability and its outer debris disk open the possibility of additional planets, both interior to and exterior to the known system. Reaching a sufficient sensitivity to search for interior planets is very challenging due to the combination of bright quasi static speckle noise close to the stellar diffraction core and relatively fast orbital motion.</description>

Gas-phase metallicities of galaxies are typically measured through auroral or nebular emission lines, but metallicity also leaves an imprint on the overall spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy and can be estimated through SED fitting. We use the ProSpect SED fitting code with a flexible parametric star formation history and an evolving metallicity history to self-consistently measure metallicities, stellar mass, and other galaxy properties for $\sim90,000$ galaxies from the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) and Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey.</description>

Using a combination of photostimulated desorption and resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization methods, the behaviors of OH radicals on the surface of interstellar ice analog was monitored at temperatures between 54 and 80 K. The OH number density on the surface of ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated compact amorphous solid water gradually decreased at temperatures above 60 K. Analyzing the temperature dependence of OH intensities with the Arrhenius equation, the decrease can be explained by recombination of two OH radicals, which is rate-limited by thermal diffusion of OH.</description>

      <description>First author: Aida Behmard
The elemental abundances of planet host stars can shed light on the conditions of planet forming environments. We test if individual abundances of 130 known/candidate planet hosts in APOGEE are statistically different from those of a reference doppelganger sample. The reference set comprises objects selected with the same Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and [Mg/H] as each Kepler Object of Interest (KOI). We predict twelve individual abundances (X = C, N, O, Na, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Ni) for the KOIs and their doppelgangers using a local linear model of these four parameters, training on ASPCAP abundance measurements for a sample of field stars with high fidelity (SNR &amp;gt; 200) APOGEE observations.</description>

Isolated dwarf galaxies nearly always exhibit robust star formation but satellite dwarf galaxies are often devoid of young stars, even in Milky Way-mass groups. Dwarf galaxies thus offer an important laboratory into the environmental processes that cease star formation. We explore the balance of quiescent and star-forming galaxies (quenched fractions) for a sample of ~400 satellite galaxies around 30 Local Volume hosts from the Exploration of Local VolumE Satellites (ELVES) Survey.</description>

Quantifying the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos has been key for testing cosmological models on various scales. Below $M_\star \sim 10^9,M_\odot$, such studies have primarily relied on the satellite galaxy population orbiting the Milky Way. Here we present new constraints on the connection between satellite galaxies and their host dark matter subhalos using the largest sample of satellite galaxies in the Local Volume ($D \lesssim 12,\mathrm{Mpc}$) to date.</description>

Presently, it is broadly assumed that fast radio bursts (FRBs) are sources of coherent emission powered by the magnetic energy release in magnetars. However, the exact emission mechanism is not known, yet. Two main frameworks exist: magnetospheric emission and radiation from external relativistic shocks. In this brief review, I describe basics of both approaches and discuss how they are probed by modern observations.

We present a physically motivated model for the manner in which a stellar magnetic field sculpts the inner edge of a protoplanetary disk, and examine the consequence for the migration and stopping of sub-Neptune and super-Earth planets. This model incorporates a transition zone exterior to the inner truncation of the disk, where the surface density profile is modified by the diffusion of the stellar magnetic field into the disk.</description>

We consider the recent results on UHECR (Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray), clustering, composition, distribution in the sky, from the energy of several EeV with the dipole anisotropy up to the highest ones. We have suggested since 2008 and we reconfirm here that UHECR at 40 up to 70 EeV are mostly made by light and lightest nuclei. The remarkable Virgo absence and the few localized nearby extragalactic sources as CenA, NG 253, M82 may be well understood by the lightest nuclei fragility and opacity within Mpc distances.</description>

      <description>First author: Syeda Lammim Ahad
The diffuse light within galaxy groups and clusters provides valuable insight into the growth of massive cosmic structures. Groups are particularly interesting in this context, because they represent the link between galactic haloes and massive clusters. However, low surface brightness makes their diffuse light extremely challenging to detect individually. Stacking many groups is a promising alternative, but its physical interpretation is complicated by possible systematic variations of diffuse light profiles with other group properties.</description>

I argue that the assumption that the jets that shape the axisymmetrical morphological features of core collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants are post-kick jets, i.e., the neutron star (NS) launches these jets after the explosion and after it acquired its natal kick velocity, leads to the conclusion that the pre-collapse cores of CCSN progenitors have sufficient angular momentum fluctuations to support jittering jets that explode the star.</description>

We study a model of inflation with multiple pseudo-scalar fields coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field through Chern-Simons interactions. Because of parity violating interactions, one polarization of the gauge field is amplified yielding to enhanced curvature perturbation power spectrum. Inflation proceeds in multiple stages as each pseudo-scalar field rolls towards its minimum yielding to distinct multiple peaks in the curvature perturbations power spectrum at various scales during inflation.</description>

      <description>First author: Giuseppe Morello
We explore how finite integration time or temporal binning can affect the analysis of exoplanet phase-curves. We provide analytical formulae to account for this effect or, if neglected, to estimate the potential biases in the retrieved parameters. As expected, due to their smoother variations over longer time-scales, phase curves can be binned more heavily than transits without causing severe biases. In the simplest case of a sinusoidal phase curve with period $P$, the integration time $\Delta t$ reduces its amplitude by the scaling factor $\text{sinc}{ \left ( \pi \Delta t / P \right ) }$, without altering its phase or shape.</description>

MACS0647$-$JD is a triply-lensed $z\sim11$ galaxy originally discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we report new JWST imaging, which clearly resolves MACS0647$-$JD as having two components that are either merging galaxies or stellar complexes within a single galaxy. Both are very small, with stellar masses $\sim10^8,M_\odot$ and radii $r&amp;lt;100,\rm pc$. The brighter larger component &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; is intrinsically very blue ($\beta\sim-2.6$), likely due to very recent star formation and no dust, and is spatially extended with an effective radius $\sim70,\rm pc$.</description>

Light pollution can be rigorously described in terms of the volume concentration of anthropogenic photons (light quanta) in the terrestrial atmosphere. This formulation, consistent with the basic physics of the emission, scattering and absorption of light, allows one to express light pollution levels in terms of particle volume concentrations, in a completely analogous way as it is currently done with other classical pollutants, like particulate matter or molecular contaminants.</description>

The liquid metal-liquid silicate partitioning of molybdenum and tungsten during core formation must be well-constrained in order to understand the evolution of Earth and other planetary bodies, in particular because the Hf-W isotopic system is used to date early planetary evolution. We combine 48 new high pressure and temperature experimental results with a comprehensive database of previous experiments to re-examine the systematics of Mo and W partitioning.</description>

GRB 221009A is a bright Gamma-ray burst (GRB) with isotropic energy being larger than $10^{54} ~{\rm ergs}$. Its fairly low redshift makes it a promising candidate for high energy neutrino detection. However, a neutrino search for this GRB reported by the \emph{IceCube} collaboration yielded a null result. In this paper, we utilize the upper limit from IceCube observation to test different GRB prompt emission models. We find that, at least for this specific burst, the dissipative photosphere model could be ruled out in a large parameter space.</description>

Annually-resolved measurements of the radiocarbon content in tree-rings have revealed rare sharp rises in carbon-14 production. These &amp;lsquo;Miyake events&amp;rsquo; are likely produced by rare increases in cosmic radiation from the Sun or other energetic astrophysical sources. The radiocarbon produced is not only circulated through the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere and oceans, but also absorbed by the biosphere and locked in the annual growth rings of trees. To interpret high-resolution tree-ring radiocarbon measurements therefore necessitates modelling the entire global carbon cycle.</description>

Barred structures are important in understanding galaxy evolution, but they were not included explicitly in most dynamical models for nearby galaxies due to their complicated morphological and kinematic properties. We modify the triaxial orbit-superposition Schwarzschild implementation by Van den Bosch et al. (2008) to include barred structures explicitly. The gravitational potential is a combination of a spherical dark matter halo and stellar mass; with the 3D stellar density distribution de-projected from the observed 2D image using a two-component de-projection method, including an axisymmetric disk and a triaxial barred bulge.</description>

Electron-positron pair production is the essential process for high-energy gamma-ray astrophysical observations. Following the pioneering OSO-3 counter telescope, the field evolved into use of particle tracking instruments, largely derived from high-energy physics detectors. Although many of the techniques were developed on balloon-borne gamma-ray telescopes, the need to escape the high background in the atmosphere meant that the breakthrough discoveries came from the SAS-2 and COS-B satellites.</description>

The magnetic field is believed to play a critical role in the bulk acceleration and propagation of jets produced in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Polarization observations of AGN jets provide valuable information about their magnetic fields. As a result of radiative transfer, jet structure, and stratification, among other factors, it is not always straightforward to determine the magnetic field structures from observed polarization. We review these effects and their impact on polarization emission at a variety of wavelengths, including radio, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths in this paper.</description>

Numerical simulations in cosmology require trade-offs between volume, resolution and run-time that limit the volume of the Universe that can be simulated, leading to sample variance in predictions of ensemble-average quantities such as the power spectrum or correlation function(s). Sample variance is particularly acute at large scales, which is also where analytic techniques can be highly reliable. This provides an opportunity to combine analytic and numerical techniques in a principled way to improve the dynamic range and reliability of predictions for clustering statistics.</description>

Type Iax Supernovae (SNe Iax) form a class of peculiar SNe Ia, whose early-phase spectra share main spectral line identifications with canonical SNe Ia but with higher ionization and much lower line velocities. Their late-time behaviors deviate from usual SNe Ia in many respects; SNe Iax keep showing photospheric spectra over several 100 days and the luminosity decline is very slow. In the present work, we study the late-time spectra of SN Iax 2019muj including a newly-presented spectrum at ~500 days.</description>

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) offers new diagnostic possibilities that complement other commonly used diagnostics for the study of our Sun. In particular, ALMA&amp;rsquo;s ability to serve as an essentially linear thermometer of the chromospheric gas at unprecedented spatial resolution at millimetre wavelengths and future polarisation measurements have great diagnostic potential. Solar ALMA observations are therefore expected to contribute significantly to answering long-standing questions about the structure, dynamics and energy balance of the outer layers of the solar atmosphere.</description>

Magnetars are neutron stars with exceptionally strong dipole magnetic fields which are observed to display a range of x-ray flaring behavior, but the flaring mechanism is not well understood. The third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Virgo extended from April 1, 2019 to March 27, 2020, and contained x-ray flares from known magnetar SGR 1935+2154, as well as the newly-discovered magnetar, Swift J1818-1607. We search for gravitational waves coincident with these magnetar flares with minimally modeled, coherent searches which specifically target both short-duration gravitational waves produced by excited f-modes in the magnetar&amp;rsquo;s core, as well as long-duration gravitational waves motivated by the Quasi-Periodic Oscillations observed in the tails of giant flares.</description>

      <description>First author: Nestor Mirabal
The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains elusive. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the best candidates able to meet the stringent energy requirements needed for particle acceleration to such high energies. If UHECRs were accelerated by the central engine of GRB 221009A, it might be possible to detect secondary photons and neutrinos as the UHECRs travel from the source to the Earth. Here we attempt to interpret some of the early publicly available data connected to this burst.</description>

      <description>First author: Jian-Feng Mo
The dispersion measure(DM) of fast radio burst encodes important information such as its distance, properties of intervening medium. Based on simulations in the Illustris and IllustrisTNG projects, we analyze the DM of FRBs contributed by the interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium in the hosts, $\rm{DM_{host}}$. We explore two population models - tracing the star formation rate (SFR), and the stellar mass, i.e. young and old progenitors respectively.</description>

HERMES Pathfinder (High Energy Rapid Modular Ensemble of Satellites Pathfinder) is a space mission based on a constellation of nano-satellites in a low Earth Orbit, hosting new miniaturized detectors to probe the X-ray temporal emission of bright high-energy transients such as Gamma-Ray Bursts and the electromagnetic counterparts of Gravitational Waves. This ambitious goal will be achieved exploiting at most Commercial offthe-shelf components. For HERMES-SP, a custom Power Supply Unit board has been designed to supply the needed voltages to the payload and, at the same time, protecting it from Latch-Up events.</description>

We analyze the stellar abundances of massive galaxies ($\log M_\ast/M_\odot&amp;gt;10.5$) at $z=2$ in the IllustrisTNG simulation with the goal of guiding the interpretation of current and future observations, particularly from the James Webb Space Telescope. We find that the effective size, $R_e$, of galaxies strongly affects the abundance measurements: both [Mg/H] and [Fe/H] are anti-correlated with $R_e$, while the relative abundance [Mg/Fe] slightly increases with $R_e$.</description>

We report the discovery of three transiting low-mass companions to aged stars: a brown dwarf (TOI-2336b) and two objects near the hydrogen burning mass limit (TOI-1608b and TOI-2521b). These three systems were first identified using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TOI-2336b has a radius of $1.05\pm 0.04\ R_J$, a mass of $69.9\pm 2.3\ M_J$ and an orbital period of 7.71 days. TOI-1608b has a radius of $1.</description>

High-dimensional data sets are expected from the next generation of large-scale surveys. These data sets will carry a wealth of information about the early stages of galaxy formation and cosmic reionization. Extracting the maximum amount of information from the these data sets remains a key challenge. Current simulations of cosmic reionization are computationally too expensive to provide enough realizations to enable testing different statistical methods, such as parameter inference.</description>

Inflationary gravitational waves, behaving as additional radiation in the Early Universe, can increase the effective number of relativistic species ($N_{\rm eff}$) by a further correction that depends on the integrated energy-density in gravitational waves over all scales. This effect is typically used to constrain (blue-tilted) models of inflation in light of the bounds resulting from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. In this paper, we recompute this contribution, discussing some caveats of the state-of-the-art analyses.</description>

Fibrils in the solar chromosphere carry transverse oscillations as determined from non-spectroscopic imaging data. They are estimated to carry an energy flux of several kW m$^{-2}$, which is a significant fraction of the average chromospheric radiative energy losses. We aim to determine oscillation properties of fibrils not only in the plane-of-the-sky (horizontal) direction, but also along the line-of-sight (vertical) direction. We obtained imaging-spectroscopy data in Fe I 6173, Ca II 8542, and Ca II K obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope.</description>

A specific modification of Newtonian dynamics known as MOND has been shown to reproduce the dynamics of most astrophysical systems at different scales without invoking non-baryonic dark matter (DM). There is, however, a long-standing unsolved problem when MOND is applied to rich clusters of galaxies in the form of a deficit (by a factor around two) of predicted dynamical mass derived from the virial theorem with respect to observations.</description>

      <description>First author: Tae-hyeon Shin
The density profiles of dark matter haloes contain rich information about their growth history and physical properties. One particularly interesting region is the splashback radius, $R_{\rm sp}$, which marks the transition between particles orbiting in the halo and particles undergoing first infall. While the dependence of $R_{\rm sp}$ on the recent accretion rate is well established and theoretically expected, it is not clear exactly what parts of the accretion history $R_{\rm sp}$ responds to, and what other halo properties might additionally influence its position.</description>

Efficiently mapping baryonic properties onto dark matter is a major challenge in astrophysics. Although semi-analytic models (SAMs) and hydrodynamical simulations have made impressive advances in reproducing galaxy observables across cosmologically significant volumes, these methods still require significant computation times, representing a barrier to many applications. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently proven to be the natural choice for learning physical relations. Among the most inherently graph-like structures found in astrophysics are the dark matter merger trees that encode the evolution of dark matter halos.</description>

Stellar flares present challenges to the potential habitability of terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarf stars through inducing changes in the atmospheric composition and irradiating the planet&amp;rsquo;s surface in large amounts of ultraviolet light. To examine their impact, we have coupled a general circulation model with a photochemical kinetics scheme to examine the response and changes of an Earth-like atmosphere to stellar flares and coronal mass ejections.</description>

Fallback supernovae and the collapsar scenario for long-gamma ray burst and hypernovae have received considerable interest as pathways to black-hole formation and extreme transient events. Consistent simulations of these scenarios require a general relativistic treatment and need to deal appropriately with the formation of a singularity. Free evolution schemes for the Einstein equations can handle the formation of black holes by means of excision or puncture schemes.</description>

      <description>First author: E. Redaelli
Prestellar cores, the birthplace of Sun-like stars, form from the fragmentation of the filamentary structure that composes molecular clouds, from which they must inherit at least partially the kinematics. Furthermore, when they are on the verge of gravitational collapse, they show signs of subsonic infall motions. How extended these motions are, which depends on how the collapse occurs, remains largely unknown. We want to investigate the kinematics of the envelope that surrounds the prototypical prestellar core L1544, studying the cloud-core connection.</description>

These previously unpublished archival data shed new light on the content of the interstellar medium of M104. In particular, molecular hydrogen measured by CO emission and dust measured by far-infrared light are uniformly distributed along the ring. The ionized gas revealed by H$\alpha$ and [CII] emission is distributed in knots along the ring.</description>

Over 150 resolved, kpc-scale X-ray jets hosted by active galactic nuclei have been discovered with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. A significant fraction of these jets have an X-ray spectrum either too high in flux or too hard to be consistent with the high-energy extension of the radio-to-optical synchrotron spectrum, a subtype we identify as Multiple Spectral Component (MSC) X-ray jets. A leading hypothesis for the origin of the X-rays is the inverse-Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background by the same electron population producing the radio-to-optical synchrotron spectrum (known as the IC/CMB model).</description>

We report the detection of a long-timescale negative lag, where the blue bands lag the red bands, in the nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy Fairall 9. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) light curves show variability over a wide range of timescales. By measuring time lags between different wavelengths, the otherwise inaccessible structure and kinematics of the accretion disk can be studied. One common approach, reverberation mapping, quantifies the continuum and line lags moving outwards through the disk at the light-travel time, revealing the size and temperature profile of the disk.</description>

To make optimal use of the information available in such a galaxy survey, we present a Bayesian method for inferring the angular power spectra of the weak lensing fields, together with an inference of the noise-cleaned tomographic weak lensing shear and convergence (projected mass) maps.</description>

Fundamental parameters (mass, radius, log(L_{Bol}/L_{Sun}), log(g)) determined from our model agree within 1\sigma to SED-derived values except for T_{eff} where our retrieved T_{eff} is approximately 100 K cooler than the evolutionary model-based SED value.</description>

After their birth a significant fraction of all stars pass through the tidal threshold (prah) of their cluster of origin into the classical tidal tails. The asymmetry between the number of stars in the leading and trailing tails tests gravitational theory. All five open clusters with tail data (Hyades, Praesepe, Coma Berenices, COIN-Gaia 13, NGC 752) have visibly more stars within dcl = 50 pc of their centre in their leading than their trailing tail.</description>

Spin state predictions for defunct satellites in geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) are valuable for active debris removal and servicing missions as well as material shedding studies and attitude-dependent solar radiation pressure (SRP) modeling. Previous studies have shown that solar radiation torques can explain the observed spin state evolution of some GEO objects via the Yarkovsky-O&amp;rsquo;Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect. These studies have focused primarily on uniform rotation.</description>

Protoplanetary disks are gaseous systems in Keplerian rotation around young stars, known to be turbulent. They include a small fraction of dust from which planets form. In the incremental scenario for planet growth, the formation of kilometer-size objects (planetesimals) from pebbles is a major open question. Clustering of particles is necessary for solids to undergo a local gravitational collapse. To address this question, the dynamic of inertial particles in turbulent flows with Keplerian rotation and shear is studied.</description>

An accurate calibration of the source redshift distribution $p(z)$ is a key aspect in the analysis of cosmic shear data. This, one way or another, requires the use of spectroscopic or high-quality photometric samples. However, the difficulty to obtain colour-complete spectroscopic samples matching the depth of weak lensing catalogs means that the analyses of different cosmic shear datasets often use the same samples for redshift calibration.</description>

We study the luminous blue variable candidate J004229.87+410551.8 in the Andromeda Galaxy. Earlier, the star displayed a spectral anomaly: although a hot emission spectrum had been detected, it had strong CaII H and K absorption lines. Subsequently the star was assumed to be a hot hypergiant or a B[e] supergiant. For the purpose of clear star classification, we conducted spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the object and its surroundings with the 6-m telescope of SAO RAS, the 3.</description>

      <description>First author: Lilit V. Barkhudaryan
In this Letter, using classified 197 supernovae (SNe) Ia, we perform an analyses of their height distributions from the disc in edge-on spirals and investigate their light-curve (LC) decline rates $(\Delta m_{15})$. We demonstrate, for the first time, that 91T-, 91bg-like, and normal SNe Ia subclasses are distributed differently toward the plane of their host disc. The average height from the disc and its comparison with scales of thin/thick disc components gives a possibility to roughly estimate the SNe Ia progenitor ages: 91T-like events, being at the smallest heights, originate from relatively younger progenitors with ages of about several 100 Myr, 91bg-like SNe, having the highest distribution, arise from progenitors with significantly older ages $\sim 10$ Gyr, and normal SNe Ia, which distributed between those of the two others, are from progenitors of about one up to $\sim 10$ Gyr.</description>

      <description>First author: Nadine H. Soliman
Partial dust obscuration in active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been proposed as a potential explanation for some cases of AGN variability. The dust-gas mixture present in AGN torii is accelerated by radiation pressure leading to the launching of an AGN wind. Dust under these conditions has been shown to be unstable to a generic class of fast growing resonant drag instabilities (RDIs). We present the first set of numerical simulations of radiation driven outflows that include explicit dust dynamics in conditions resembling AGN winds and discuss the implications of the RDIs on the morphology of the AGN torus, AGN variability, and the ability of the radiation to effectively launch a wind.</description>

Gaseous outflows are key phenomena in the evolution of galaxies, as they affect star formation (either positively or negatively), eject gas from the core or disk, and directly cause mixing of pristine and processed material. Active outflows may be detected through searches for broad spectral line emission or high-velocity gas, but it is also possible to determine the presence of past outflows by searching for extended reservoirs of chemically enriched molecular gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxies.</description>

The GRB 190829A has been widely studied due to its nature and the high energy emission presented. Due to the detection of a very-high-energy component by the High Energy Stereoscopic System and the event&amp;rsquo;s atypically middling luminosity, it has been categorized in a select, limited group of bursts bordering classic GRBs and nearby sub-energetic events. Given the range of models utilized to adequately characterize the afterglow of this burst, it has proven challenging to identify the most probable explanation.</description>

The global neutral hydrogen 21 cm signal extracted from the all-sky averaged radio spectra is one of the signatures of the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization (CD/EoR). The frequency-dependency of antenna beam patterns coupled with the strong foreground emission could introduce artificial spectral structures and cause false detection. A digital beamforming array could be potentially employed to form achromatic station beam patterns to overcome this problem.</description>

      <description>First author: C. Lardo
Photometric investigations have revealed that Galactic globular clusters exhibit internal metallicity variations amongst the so-called first-population stars, until now considered to have a homogeneous initial chemical composition. This is not fully supported by the sparse spectroscopic evidence, which so far gives conflicting results. Here, we present a high-resolution re-analysis of five stars in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 2808 taken from the literature. Target stars are bright red giants with nearly identical atmospheric parameters belonging to the first population according to their identification in the chromosome map of the cluster, and we have measured precise differential abundances for Fe, Si, Ca, Ti, and Ni to the ~0.</description>

      <description>First author: Wilmar Cardona
Interesting discrepancies in cosmological parameters are challenging the success of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Direct measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ using Cepheid variables and supernovae turn out to be higher than inferred from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Weak galaxy lensing surveys consistently report values of the strength of matter clustering $\sigma_8$ lower than values derived from the CMB in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. In this paper we address these discrepancies in cosmological parameters by considering Dark Energy (DE) as a fluid with evolving equation of state $w_{\mathrm{de}}(z)$, constant sound speed squared $\hat{c}{\mathrm{s}}^{2}$, and vanishing anisotropic stress $\sigma$.</description>

      <description>First author: David Garofalo
Jet re-orientation associated with the time evolution of radio quasars explains the formation of X-shaped radio galaxies and their preference for isolated environments. But since X-shaped radio galaxies are generally not found in dense environments (e.g. groups/clusters), the jet re-orientation phenomenon for radio galaxies in groups and clusters has been ignored. We take a closer look at the re-orientation of FRI jets with respect to FRII jets, and find that it may constitute the as-yet unidentified trigger for star formation suppression in radio galaxies.</description>

Context. About 0.2-2% of giant stars are Li-rich, whose lithium abundance (A(Li)) is higher than 1.5 dex. Among them, near 6% are super Li-rich with A(Li) exceeding 3.2 dex. Meanwhile, the formation mechanism of these Li-rich and super Li-rich giants is still under debate. Aims. Considering the compact He core of red giants, attention is paid to the effect of element diffusion on A(Li). In particular, when the He core flash occurs, the element diffusion makes the thermohaline mixing zone extend inward and connect to the inner convection region of stars.</description>

The 1.3deg (G1.3) and 1.6deg (G1.6) cloud complexes in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy have been proposed to possibly reside at the intersection region of the X1 and X2 orbits for several reasons. This includes the detection of co-spatial low- and high-velocity clouds, high velocity dispersion, high fractional molecular abundances of shock-tracing molecules, and kinetic temperatures that are higher than for usual CMZ clouds.</description>

The fast evolving TeV-PeV transients and their delayed GeV-TeV cascade emission in principle server as an ideal probe of the inter-galactic magnetic fields which are hard to be measured by other methods. Very recently, LHASSO has detected the very high energy emission of the extraordinary powerful GRB 221009A up to $\sim 18$ TeV within $\sim 2000$ s after the burst trigger. Here we report the detection of a $\sim 400$ GeV photon, without accompanying prominent $\gamma$ rays down to $\sim 2$ GeV, by Fermi-LAT in the direction of GRB 221009A at about 0.</description>

General relativity predicts that images of optically thin accretion flows around black holes should generically have a photon ring,&#39;&#39; composed of a series of increasingly sharp subrings that correspond to increasingly strongly lensed emission near the black hole. Because the effects of lensing are determined by the spacetime curvature, the photon ring provides a pathway to precise measurements of the black hole properties and tests of the Kerr metric.</description>

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M 87 provided the first image of the accretion environment on horizon scales. General relativity predicts that the image of the shadow should be nearly circular, given the inclination angle of the black hole M 87*. A robust detection of ellipticity in the image reconstructions of M 87* could signal new gravitational physics on horizon scales.</description>

Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves provides a potential new probe of dark matter structures. In this work, we consider the microlensing effect on gravitational wave signals from black hole binaries induced by low-mass dark matter halos that do not retain enough baryonic matter to hold stars. We clarify systematically when this microlensing effect is relevant and study in detail its detectability by future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

This paper analyse the properties of minimal solutions for the reconstruction of the lens potential in the singular perturbative approach. These minimal solutions corresponds to an expansion with a minimal degree in Fourier expansion of the perturbative fields. Using these minimal solutions prevent spurious physically meaningless terms in the reconstruction of the fields. In effect a perturbative analysis indicates that a small change in the source model will corresponds to the higher order terms in the expansion of the fields.</description>

Magnetospheres of neutron stars can be perturbed by star quakes or interaction in a binary system. The perturbations are typically in the kHz band and excite magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. We show that compressive magnetospheric waves steepen into monster shocks mediated by radiation reaction, different from normal collisionless shocks. The shocks admit a simple analytical description. They expand through the magnetosphere with radiative losses, and then a blast wave is launched into the neutron-star wind.</description>

We present a study of barred galaxies in the cluster environment, exploiting a sample of galaxies drawn from the extended WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (OmegaWINGS) that covers up to the outer regions of 32 local X-ray selected clusters. Barred galaxies are identified through a semi-automatic analysis of ellipticity and position angle profiles. We find, in agreement with previous studies, a strong co-dependence of the bar fraction with the galaxy stellar mass and morphological type, being maximum for massive late-type galaxies.</description>

Cosmic voids are known as underdense substructures of the cosmic web that cover a large volume of the Universe. It is known that cosmic voids contain a small number of dark matter halos, so the existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) in these secluded regions of the Universe is not unlikely. In this work, we calculate the merger rate of PBHs in dark matter halos structured in cosmic voids and determine their contribution to gravitational wave events resulting from black hole mergers recorded by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO)-Advanced Virgo (aVirgo) detectors.</description>

Radio-detection is a mature technique that has gained large momentum over the past decades. Its physical detection principle is mainly driven by the electromagnetic part of the shower, and is therefore not too sensitive to uncertainties on hadronic interactions. Furthermore its technical detection principle allows for a 100% duty cycle, and large surface coverage thanks to the low cost of antennas. Various detection methods of UHE particles now rely on the radio signal as main observable.</description>

The presence of phosphine (PH$_3$) in the atmosphere of Venus was reported by Greaves et al. (2021a), based on observations of the J=1-0 transition at 267 GHz using ground-based, millimeter-wave spectroscopy. This unexpected discovery presents a challenge for our understanding of Venus&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, and has led to a reappraisal of the possible sources and sinks of atmospheric phosphorous-bearing gases. Here we present results from a search for PH$_3$ on Venus using the GREAT instrument aboard the SOFIA aircraft, over three flights conducted in November 2021.</description>

The instrument was designed to measure the polarization of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation from the sky, obtaining the Stokes parameters of the incoming signal simultaneously, in a frequency range from 10 to 20 GHz.</description>

The relative strength $\delta B/B$ of the wave grows as a function of radius before it reaches the light cylinder, and what starts as a small perturbation can grow to become nonlinear before it escapes the magnetosphere. Using first-principles Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, we study in detail the evolution of the wave as it becomes nonlinear.</description>

      <description>First author: Pekka Heinämäki
Generally the dynamical state of superclusters is poorly known. We study properties of superclusters and select a sample of quasi-spherical superclusters, the dynamics of which can be studied using the $\Lambda$ significance diagram. We extracted our supercluster sample with an adaptive local threshold density method from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) data and estimated their masses using the dynamical masses for member galaxies and groups.</description>

      <description>First author: Olivier Deligny
Several attempts to detect extensive air showers (EAS) induced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays have been conducted in the last decade based on the molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation (MBR) at GHz frequencies from quasi-elastic collisions of ionisation electrons left in the atmosphere after the passage of the cascade of particles. These attempts have led to the detection of a handful of signals only, all of them forward-directed along the shower axis and hence suggestive of originating from geomagnetic and Askaryan emissions extending into GHz frequencies close to the Cherenkov angle.</description>

      <description>First author: Ivan Demidov
The luminosity of the Soft Gamma Repeater (SGR) flares significantly exceeds the Eddington luminosity. This is because they emit mainly in the E-mode, for which the radiative cross-sections are strongly suppressed. The energy is released in the magnetosphere forming a magnetically trapped pair fireball, and the surface of the star is illuminated by the powerful radiation from the fireball. We study the ablation of the matter from the surface by this radiation.</description>

We analyze two distinct samples of GRBs, with and without radio afterglow emission. We use a sample of 211 GRBs which is an update of the previous sample from arXiv:1902.01974, and find, in agreement with previous results (although with a sample that is almost twice as large) as the intrinsic gamma-ray duration (Tint) and isotropic equivalent energy (Eiso) distributions between these two populations appear to differ significantly.</description>

Context: Recent observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) have shown that the large dust aggregates observed at millimeter wavelengths settle to the midplane into a remarkably thin layer. Aims: We intend to find out if the geometric thinness of these layers is evidence against the vertical shear instability (VSI) operating in these disks. Methods: We performed hydrodynamic simulations of a protoplanetary disk with a locally isothermal equation of state, and let the VSI fully develop.</description>

The total $\chi^{2}$ for a given model is defined as the sum of components constructed to characterize narrow-band features of observed spectra (e.</description>

The Pierre Auger Observatory, being the largest air-shower experiment in the world, offers an unprecedented exposure to neutral particles at the highest energies. Since the start of data taking more than 18 years ago, various searches for ultra-high-energy (UHE, $E\gtrsim10^{17},\text{eV}$) photons have been performed: either for a diffuse flux of UHE photons, for point sources of UHE photons or for UHE photons associated with transient events like gravitational wave events.</description>

Neutrinos associated with solar flares (solar-flare neutrinos) provide information on particle acceleration mechanisms during the impulsive phase of solar flares. We searched using the Super-Kamiokande detector for neutrinos from solar flares that occurred during solar cycles $23$ and $24$, including the largest solar flare (X28.0) on November 4th, 2003. In order to minimize the background rate we searched for neutrino interactions within narrow time windows coincident with $\gamma$-rays and soft X-rays recorded by satellites.</description>

We present simulations of the capabilities of the ngVLA to image at $\sim 0.75$ kpc resolution ($0.085&amp;quot;$), molecular line emission from star forming disk galaxies at high redshift. The results are compared to the current capabilities of ALMA. ALMA can detect the integrated emission, and determine the velocity gradient and size across the brighter emission regions of the galaxy. The ngVLA is a factor $\sim 6$ more sensitive at the adopted spatial and velocity resolution.</description>

We explore the effects of the 2029 Earth encounter on asteroid (99942) Apophis&amp;rsquo; non-principal axis spin state, leveraging refined orbit, spin state, and inertia information provided by more recent optical and radar observations. Propagating the asteroids&amp;rsquo; coupled orbit and rigid body attitude dynamics through the flyby, we present the range of possible post-flyby spin states. These spin state distributions will be valuable for planning Apophis observation campaigns and spacecraft missions, most notably OSIRIS-APEX.</description>

The ages of stars have historically relied on isochrone fitting of standardised grids of models. While these stellar models have provided key constraints on observational samples of massive stars, they inherit many systematic uncertainties, mainly in the internal mixing mechanisms applied throughout the grid, fundamentally undermining the isochrone method. In this work, we utilise the M-L plane of Higgins &amp;amp; Vink as a method of determining stellar age, with mixing-corrected models applying a calibrated core overshooting alpha_ov and rotation rate to fit the observational data.</description>

Recent spatially-resolved observations of protoplanetary disks revealed a plethora of substructures, including concentric rings and gaps, inner cavities, misalignments, spiral arms, and azimuthal asymmetries. This is the major breakthrough in studies of protoplanetary disks since Protostars and Planets VI and is reshaping the field of planet formation. However, while the capability of imaging substructures in protoplanetary disks has been steadily improving, the origin of many substructures are still largely debated.</description>

We study the observable properties of compressible MHD turbulence covering different turbulence regimes, based on synthetic synchrotron observations arising from 3D MHD numerical simulations. Using the synchrotron emissivity and intensity, we first explore how the cosmic ray spectral indices affect the measurements of turbulence properties by employing normalized correlation functions. We then study how the anisotropy of synchrotron total and polarization intensities arising from three fundamental MHD modes vary with the viewing angle, i.</description>

AI super-resolution, combining deep learning and N-body simulations has been shown to successfully reproduce the large scale structure and halo abundances in the Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmological model. Here, we extend its use to models with a different dark matter content, in this case Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), in the approximation that the difference is encoded in the initial power spectrum. We focus on redshift z = 2, with simulations that model smaller scales and lower masses, the latter by two orders of magnitude, than has been done in previous AI super-resolution work.</description>

Dwarf galaxies are ideal laboratories to study the relationship between the environment and AGN activity. However, the type of environments in which dwarf galaxies hosting AGN reside is still unclear and limited to low-redshift studies (z &amp;lt; 0.5). We use the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) to investigate, for the first time, their environments at 0.5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.9. We select a sample of 12,942 low-mass ($\rm{log}(M_\mathrm{*}/M_{\odot})\leq10$) galaxies and use the emission-line diagnostic diagram to identify AGN.</description>

In this work we address the issue of whether the division of clusters in cool cores (CCs) and non-cool cores (NCCs) is due to a primordial difference or to how clusters evolve across cosmic time. Our first goal is to establish if spectra from the central regions of a subclass of NCCs known as cool core remnants (CCRs) are consistent with having a small but significant amount of short cooling time gas, thereby allowing a transformation to CC systems on a timescale of a giga year.</description>

We incorporate new scale-intelligent models of metal-enriched star formation (\starss) with surrogate models of primordial stellar feedback (\starnet) into the astrophysics simulation code \enzo to analyze the impact of heterogeneous metal enrichment on the first galaxies. Our study includes the earliest generations of stars and the protogalaxies ($10^6 \lesssim M_v/M_\odot \lesssim 10^8$) containing them. We compare results obtained with the new methods to two common paradigms of metallicity initial conditions in simulations: ignoring the metallicity initial condition and assuming a uniform metallicity floor.</description>

Aims. We begin by exploring the influence of two classes of commonly adopted heating models on the formation behaviour of solar prominences. These models consider either an exponential variation dependent on height alone, or local density and magnetic field conditions. We highlight and address some of the limitations inherent to these early approximations by proposing a new, dynamic 2D flux rope heating model that qualitatively accounts for the 3D topology of the twisted flux rope field.</description>

The most important theory of the spiral arms of galaxies is the density wave theory based on the Lin-Shu dispersion relation. However, the density waves move with the group velocity towards the inner Lindblad resonance and tend to disappear. Various mechanisms to replenish the spiral waves have been proposed. Nonlinear effects play an important role near the inner and outer Lindblad resonances and corotation. The orbits supporting the spiral arms are precessing ellipses in normal galaxies that extend up to the 4/1 resonance.</description>

A significant fraction of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are thought to experience an extreme loss of volatiles because of atmospheric evaporation in the early stages of their life. Though the mechanisms behind the extreme mass loss are not fully understood, two contenders have been widely discussed: photoevaporation from X-ray and ultraviolet irradiation and core powered mass loss. Here, it is shown that both mechanisms occur but with different timescales, and that atmospheric loss can take place over three regimes.</description>

The brightest long gamma-ray burst detected so far by the Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM telescopes, GRB~221009A provides an unprecedented opportunity for understanding the high-energy processes in extreme transient phenomena. We find that the conventional leptonic models, synchrotron and synchrotron-self-Compton, for the afterglow emission from this source is unable to explain observation of $\gamma$ rays, by the LHAASO detector, extending up to 18 TeV energies. We model $\gamma$-ray spectrum estimated in the energy range 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Andrew Robertson
We investigate whether the shapes of galaxy clusters inferred from weak gravitational lensing can be used as a test of the nature of dark matter. We analyse mock weak lensing data, with gravitational lenses extracted from cosmological simulations run with two different dark matter models (CDM and SIDM). We fit elliptical NFW profiles to the shear fields of the simulated clusters. Despite large differences in the distribution of 3D shapes between CDM and SIDM, we find that the distributions of weak-lensing-inferred cluster shapes are almost indistinguishable.</description>

      <description>First author: P B Jones
The growth of a longitudinal or quasi-longitudinal Langmuir mode in the outward-moving beam of ions and protons that forms the open sector of an ion-proton pulsar magnetosphere radiates as an analogue of an end-fed high-impedance horizontal straight-wire antenna an integral number of half-waves in length. The radiation has, broadly, the energy flux, linear polarization and spectral index that are widely observed: also, the notch phenomenon seen in some integrated pulse profiles occurs naturally.</description>

      <description>First author: Jiamin Hou
Extracting the non-Gaussian information encoded in the higher-order clustering statistics of the large-scale structure is key to fully realizing the potential of upcoming galaxy surveys. We investigate the information content of the redshift-space {\it weighted skew spectra} of biased tracers as efficient estimators for 3-point clustering statistics. The skew spectra are constructed by correlating the observed galaxy field with an appropriately-weighted square of it. We perform numerical Fisher forecasts using two synthetic datasets; the halo catalogs from the Quijote N-body simulations and the galaxy catalogs from the Molino suite.</description>

      <description>First author: Bruce Edelman
We introduce the first complete non-parametric model for the astrophysical distribution of the binary black hole (BBH) population. Constructed from basis splines, we use these models to conduct the most comprehensive data-driven investigation of the BBH population to date, simultaneously fitting non-parametric models for the BBH mass ratio, spin magnitude and misalignment, and redshift distributions for the first time. Using the BBHs in GWTC-3, we report the same features recovered with similarly flexible models of the mass distribution, most notably the peaks in merger rates at primary masses of ${\sim}10,M_\odot$ and ${\sim}35,M_\odot$.</description>

We study how supersonic streaming velocities of baryons relative to dark matter &amp;ndash; a large-scale effect imprinted at recombination and coherent over $\sim 3$ Mpc scales &amp;ndash; affects the formation of dwarf galaxies at $z \gtrsim 5$. We perform cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, including and excluding streaming velocities, in regions centered on halos with $M_{\rm vir}(z=0) \approx 10^{10}$ M${\odot}$; the simulations are part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project and run with FIRE-3 physics.</description>

      <description>First author: Nikita Kramarev
We consider the gas dynamics in an accreting binary system of degenerate stars within the framework of the Newtonian approximation. In such a system, the accretion stream can impact the surface of a white dwarf (WD) or neutron star (NS) as a result of the very compact orbit. This causes a loss of angular momentumfrom the orbit and spin-up of the accretor. We construct approximations for the specific angular momentum of the accreting matter which goes to spin up the accretor and some other parameters of the system.</description>

The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, a key mission in multiwavelength and multimessenger studies, has been surveying the gamma-ray sky from its low-Earth orbit since 2008. Its two scientific instruments, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and the Large Area Telescope (LAT), cover 8 orders of magnitude in photon energy. The GBM consists of 12 Sodium Iodide detectors and 2 Bismuth Germinate detectors, covering the 10 keV - 40 MeV energy range, arrayed on two sides of the spacecraft so as to view the entire sky that is not occulted by the Earth.</description>

      <description>First author: Rafael Alves Batista
Recently an extraordinarily bright gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A, was observed by several facilities covering the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays with energies up to 18 TeV were detected, as well as a photon with 251 TeV. Such energetic events are not expected because they would be attenuated by pair-production interactions with the extragalactic background light. This tension is, however, only apparent, and does not call for any unconventional explanation.</description>

An important tracer of the origin and evolution of cometary ices is the comparison with ices found in dense clouds and towards Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). We present a survey of ices in the 2-5 micron spectra of 23 massive YSOs, taken with the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility SpeX spectrometer. The 4.90 micron absorption band of OCS ice is detected in 20 sight-lines, more than five times the previously known detections.</description>

We investigate the effect of photon-ALP oscillations on the gamma-ray spectra of TXS 0506+056 using observations by Fermi Large Area Telescope (FERMI-LAT) and Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescopes (MAGIC) data. We individually used both the quiescent and the two VHE flaring phases around IC170922-A and additionally, the 2014 neutrino flare phase for the source to study the ALP effect at sub-PeV energies.

The properties of dust change during the transition from diffuse to dense clouds as a result of ice formation and dust coagulation, but much is still unclear about this transformation. We present 2-20 micron spectra of 49 field stars behind the Perseus and Serpens Molecular Clouds and establish relationships between the near-infrared continuum extinction (AK) and the depths of the 9.7 micron silicate (tau97) and 3.</description>

Context. Planets around stars in the solar neighbourhood will be prime targets for characterisation with upcoming large space- and ground-based facilities. Since large-scale exoplanet searches will not be feasible with such telescopes, it is crucial to use currently available data and instruments to find possible target planets before next generation facilities come online. Aims. We aim at detecting new extrasolar planets around stars in the solar neighbourhood by blind radial velocity (RV) search with ESPRESSO.</description>

We present the first mid-IR detection of the linear polarization toward the star CygOB2-12, a luminous blue hypergiant that, with Av of ~10 mag of foreground extinction, is a benchmark in the study of the properties of dust in the diffuse interstellar medium. The 8-13 micrometer spectropolarimetry, obtained with the CanariCam multi-mode camera at the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), shows clear trends with wavelength characteristic of silicate grains aligned in the interstellar magnetic field.</description>

We present total-intensity and polarized-intensity images of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant (SNR) observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The high angular-resolution and high-sensitivity images enable us to thoroughly compare the properties of the northern part with the southern part of the SNR. The central filament in the northern part and the southern part have a similar foreground rotation measure, meaning their distances are likely similar.</description>

Magnetic flux emergence from the solar interior to the atmosphere is believed to be a key process of formation of solar active regions and driving solar eruptions. Due to the limited capability of observation, the flux emergence process is commonly studied using numerical simulations. In this paper, we developed a numerical model to simulate the emergence of a twisted magnetic flux tube from the convection zone to the corona using the AMR&amp;ndash;CESE&amp;ndash;MHD code, which is based on the conservation-element solution-element method with adaptive mesh refinement.</description>

To reach the full potential of the new generation of ground based telescopes, an extremely fine adjustment of the phase is required. Wavefront control and correction before detection has therefore become one of the cornerstones of instruments to achieve targeted performance, especially for high-contrast imaging. A crucial feature of accurate wavefront control leans on the wavefront sensor (WFS). We present a strategy to design new Fourier-Filtering WFS that encode the phase close from the fundamental photon efficiency limit.</description>

The vertical structure of the accretion disks of young stars with fossil large-scale magnetic field is studied. The equations of magnetostatic equilibrium of the disk are solved taking into account the stellar gravity, gas and magnetic pressure, turbulent heating, and heating by stellar radiation. The modelled physical structure of the disk is used to simulate its chemical structure, in particular, to study the spatial distribution of CN molecules.</description>

The collapse of the magnetic rotating protostellar cloud with mass of $10,M_{\odot}$ is numerically studied. The initial ratios of the thermal, magnetic, and rotational energies of the cloud to the modulus of its gravitational energy are 0.3, 0.2 and 0.01, respectively. The emphasis is on the evolution and properties of the quasi-magnetostatic primary disk formed at the isothermal stage of the collapse. Simulations show that the primary disk size and mass increase during evolution from $1500$ au to $7400$ au and from $0.</description>

We search for a spatial association between radio pulsars and ultra-high energy neutrinos using the publicly available IceCube point source neutrino events catalog. For this purpose we use the unbinned maximum likelihood method to search for a statistically significant excess from each of the pulsars in the ATNF catalog. We do not find any pulsars with detection significance much higher than that expected from a Gaussian distribution, Therefore, we conclude that none of the currently known pulsars contribute to the diffuse neutrino flux detected by IceCube.</description>

The continuum level is a non-detection in the HETDEX spectrum, thus the measured EW is a lower limit. The source is detected with significant emission lines (&amp;gt;7sigma) at LyA+NV, CIV, and moderate emission line (~4sigma) at HeII within the wavelength coverage of HETDEX (3500 AA - 5500 AA).</description>

Observations of WASP-121 b have suggested an under-abundance of titanium and titanium-oxide from its terminator region.

We analyse 8 epochs of high-resolution spectra obtained with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at optical wavelengths, targeting orbital phases when the day-side is in view. We use a cross-correlation method to search for various atoms, TiO and VO and compare to models.</description>

We simulate the propagation and dissipation of tidally induced nonlinear gravity waves in the cores of solar-type stars. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a previously developed Boussinesq model using a spectral-element code to study the stellar core as a wave cavity that is periodically forced at the outer boundary with a given azimuthal wavenumber and an adjustable frequency. For low-amplitude forcing, the system exhibits resonances with standing g-modes at particular frequencies, corresponding to a situation in which the tidal torque is highly frequency-dependent.</description>

      <description>First author: Liang Xiao
The tomographic Alcock-Paczynski (AP) method is a promising method that uses the redshift evolution of the anisotropic clustering in redshift space to calibrate cosmology. It extends the applicable range of AP method to substantially nonlinear scales, yielding very tight cosmological constraints. For future stage-IV slitless spectroscopic surveys, the non-negligible redshift errors might reduce the advantage of the tomographic AP method by suppressing the resolution of the nonlinear structure along the line of sight.</description>

      <description>First author: Aditi Vijayan
Interstellar (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxies are linked to several physical processes that drive galaxy evolution. For example, the X-ray emission from the CGM gas around ellipticals has been linked to the AGN feedback occurring in the host. Upcoming telescopes such as HUBS, with ~ 1 eV resolution, can provide us with deep insights about the hot gas properties of such galaxies thus constrain these processes.</description>

      <description>First author: G. Pascoli
The existence of the flat rotation curves of galaxies is still perplexing. The dark matter paradigm was proposed long ago to solve this conundrum; however, this proposal is still under debate. In this paper, we search for universal relationships solely involving the baryonic density that incorporate both galactic dynamics and gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters without requiring dark matter. If this type of formula exists, we show that it is possible that it can clearly indicate that dark matter is either perfectly tailored to baryonic matter or, from a more radical point of view, even perhaps useless.</description>

We combine the kinematics of 159 globular clusters (GCs) provided by the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR 3) with other observational data to classify the GCs, and to estimate the mass of Milky Way (MW). We use the age-metallicity relation, integrals of motion, action space and the GC orbits to identify the GCs as either formed in-situ (Bulge and Disk) or ex-situ (via accretion). We find that $45.</description>

      <description>First author: K. Suchomska
Our goal is to determine, with high accuracy, the physical and orbital parameters of two double-lined eclipsing binary systems, where the components are two giant stars. We also aim to study the evolutionary status of the binaries, to derive the distances towards them by using a surface brightness-colour relation, and to compare these measurements with the measurements presented by the Gaia mission. In order to measure the physical and orbital parameters of the systems, we analysed the light curves and radial-velocity curves with the Wilson-Devinney code.</description>

Silicon mononitride ($^{28}$Si$^{14}$N, $^{29}$Si$^{14}$N, $^{30}$Si$^{14}$N, $^{28}$Si$^{15}$N) line lists covering infrared, visible and ultraviolet regions are presented. The \name\ line lists produced by ExoMol include rovibronic transitions between six electronic states: \XS, \AS, \BS, \DS, \asi, \bsi. The \ai\ potential energy and coupling curves, computed at the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI/aug-cc-pVQZ) level of theory, are refined for the observed states by fitting their analytical representations to 1052 experimentally derived SiN energy levels determined from rovibronic bands belonging to the $X$&amp;ndash;$X$, $A$&amp;ndash;$X$ and $B$&amp;ndash;$X$ electronic systems through the MARVEL procedure.</description>

New molecular line lists for calcium monohydride ($^{40}$Ca$^{1}$H) and magnesium monohydride ($^{24}$Mg$^{1}$H) and its minor isotopologues ($^{25}$Mg$^{1}$H and $^{26}$Mg$^{1}$H) are presented. The rotation-vibration-electronic (rovibronic) line lists, named \texttt{XAB}, consider transitions involving the \X, \A, and \BBp\ electronic states in the 0&amp;ndash;30,000~cm$^{-1}$ region (wavelengths $\lambda &amp;gt; 0.33$~$\mu$m) and are suitable for temperatures up to 5000 K. A comprehensive analysis of the published spectroscopic literature on CaH and MgH is used to obtain new extensive datasets of accurate rovibronic energy levels with measurement uncertainties and consistent quantum number labelling.</description>

The recent flight experiments with Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\textit{NICER}) and \textit{Insight}-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (\textit{Insight}-HXMT) have demonstrated the feasibility of X-ray pulsar-based navigation (XNAV) in the space. However, the current pulse phase estimation and navigation methods employed in the above flight experiments are computationally too expensive for handling the Crab pulsar data. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fast algorithm of on-orbit estimating the pulse phase of Crab pulsar called X-ray pulsar navigaTion usIng on-orbiT pulsAr timiNg (XTITAN).</description>

In spite of decades of theoretical efforts, the physical origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is still debated. We aim at understanding the influence of various physical processes such as radiative stellar feedback, magnetic field and non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamics on the IMF. We present a series of numerical simulations of collapsing 1000 M$\odot$ clumps taking into account radiative feedback and magnetic field with spatial resolution down to 1 AU.</description>

      <description>First author: Olivier Absil
The high-speed variability of the local water vapor content in the Earth atmosphere is a significant contributor to ground-based wavefront quality throughout the infrared domain. Unlike dry air, water vapor is highly chromatic, especially in the mid-infrared. This means that adaptive optics correction in the visible or near-infrared domain does not necessarily ensure a high wavefront quality at longer wavelengths. Here, we use literature measurements of water vapor seeing, and more recent infrared interferometric data from the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), to evaluate the wavefront quality that will be delivered to the METIS mid-infrared camera and spectrograph for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), operating from 3 to 13 {\mu}m, after single-conjugate adaptive optics correction in the near-infrared.</description>

      <description>First author: Tyler Schmaltz
Star formation is a complex process that typically occurs in dense regions of molecular clouds mainly regulated by magnetic fields, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, and self-gravity. However, it remains a challenging endeavor to trace the magnetic field and determine regions of gravitational collapse where the star is forming. Based on the anisotropic properties of MHD turbulence, a new technique termed Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT) has been proposed to address these challenges.</description>

Although H${2}$ is the simplest and the most abundant molecule in the Universe, its formation in the interstellar medium, especially in the photodissociation regions is far from being fully understood. According to suggestions, the formation of H${2}$ is catalyzed by polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on the surface of interstellar grains. In the present study, we have investigated the catalytic effect of small PAHs with an imperfect aromatic system.</description>

We present the analysis of seven microlensing planetary events with planet/host mass ratios $q &amp;lt; 10^{-4}$: KMT-2017-BLG-1194, KMT-2017-BLG-0428, KMT-2019-BLG-1806, KMT-2017-BLG-1003, KMT-2019-BLG-1367, OGLE-2017-BLG-1806, and KMT-2016-BLG-1105. They were identified by applying the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) AnomalyFinder algorithm to 2016&amp;ndash;2019 KMTNet events. A Bayesian analysis indicates that all the lens systems consist of a cold super-Earth orbiting an M or K dwarf. Together with 17 previously published and three that will be published elsewhere, AnomalyFinder has found a total of 27 planets that have solutions with $q &amp;lt; 10^{-4}$ from 2016&amp;ndash;2019 KMTNet events, which lays the foundation for the first statistical analysis of the planetary mass-ratio function based on KMTNet data.</description>

The WALLABY pilot survey has been conducted using the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP). The integrated 21-cm HI line spectra are formed in a very different manner compared to usual single-dish spectra Tully-Fisher measurements. It is thus extremely important to ensure that slight differences (e.g. biases due to missing flux) are quantified and understood in order to maximise the use of the large amount of data becoming available soon.</description>

The conditions under which galactic nuclear regions become active are largely unknown, although it has been hypothesized that secular processes related to galaxy morphology could play a significant role. We investigate this question using optical i-band images of 3096 SDSS quasars and galaxies at 0.3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.6 from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program, which possess a unique combination of area, depth and resolution, allowing the use of residual images, after removal of the quasar and smooth galaxy model, to investigate internal structural features.</description>

Supernova remnants (SNRs) are significant contributors of matter and energy to the interstellar medium. Understanding the impact and the mechanism of this contribution requires knowledge of the physical size, energy, and expansion rate of individual SNRs, which can only come if reliable distances can be obtained. We aim to determine the distance to the SNR DA 530 (G93.3+6.9), an object of low surface brightness. To achieve this, we used the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory Synthesis Telescope and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory Very Large Array to observe the absorption by intervening HI of the polarized emission from DA 530.</description>

Contemporary radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the AGNs predicts presence of the hot and strong accretion disk wind, which gets unstable far from the central region and turns into gas clumps. These inner-wind and outer clumps may be actually observed as the ultrafast outflows (UFOs) and the clumpy absorbers, respectively. We may call this picture as the &amp;ldquo;hot inner and clumpy outer wind model&amp;rdquo;. Observationally, it is challenging to place constraints on the origin of the UFOs and clumpy absorbers due to complicated spectral variations.</description>

We present Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the young, gas-rich debris disk around HD110058 at 0.3-0.6\arcsec resolution. The disk is detected in the 0.85 and 1.3~mm continuum, as well as in the J=2-1 and J=3-2 transitions of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO. The observations resolve the dust and gas distributions and reveal that this is the smallest debris disk around stars of similar luminosity observed by ALMA.</description>

It is commonly accepted that radio-loud active galactic nuclei are hosted exclusively by giant elliptical galaxies. We analyze high-resolution optical Hubble Space Telescope images of a sample of radio galaxies with extended double-lobed structures associated with disk-like optical counterparts. After systematically evaluating the probability of chance alignment between the radio lobes and the optical counterparts, we obtain a sample of 18 objects likely to have genuine associations.</description>

Strong gravitational lenses allow us to peer into the farthest reaches of space by bending the light from a background object around a massive object in the foreground. Unfortunately, these lenses are extremely rare, and manually finding them in astronomy surveys is difficult and time-consuming. We are thus tasked with finding them in an automated fashion with few if any, known lenses to form positive samples.</description>

      <description>First author: Ross J. Jennings
The millisecond pulsar J1713+0747 underwent a sudden and significant pulse shape change between April 16 and 17, 2021 (MJDs 59320 and 59321). Subsequently, the pulse shape gradually recovered over the course of several months. We report the results of continued multi-frequency radio observations of the pulsar made using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in a two-year period encompassing the shape change event, between February 2020 and March 2022.</description>

We study the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies and how they suppress star formation and maintain it quenched. A one-zone chemical model which follows in detail the time evolution of gas mass and its chemical abundances during the active and passive evolution, is adopted. The model includes both gas infall and outflow as well as detailed stellar nucleosynthesis. Elliptical galaxies with different infall masses, following a down-sizing in star formation scenario, are considered.</description>

      <description>First author: Gerard Navó
We present core-collapse supernovae simulations including nuclear reaction networks which impact explosion dynamics and nucleosynthesis. The different composition treatment can lead to changes in the neutrino heating in the vicinity of the shock, by modifying the amount of nucleons and thus the $\mathrm{\nu}$-opacity of the region. This reduces the ram pressure outside the shock and allows an easier expansion. The energy released by the nuclear reactions during collapse also slows down the accretion, and aids the shock expansion.</description>

Observations show that individual protoplanetary disk lifetimes vary from \mbox{$&amp;lt;$ 1 Myr} to $\gg$ 20 Myr. The disk lifetime distribution is currently unknown. For the example of a Gaussian distribution of the disk lifetime, I suggest a simple method for deducing such a disk lifetimes distribution. The median disk lifetimes inferred with this method is also shown.

Here, we demonstrate that polarization properties show a wide diversity depending on viewing angles. To simulate images of a supermassive black hole and surrounding plasma, we performed a full-polarimetric general relativistic radiative transfer based on three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models with moderate magnetic strengths. Under an assumption of a hot-jet and cold-disk in the electron temperature prescription, we confirmed a typical scenario where polarized synchrotron emissions from the funnel jet experience Faraday rotation and conversion in the equatorial disk.</description>

      <description>First author: Eric L. Sandquist
We present analyses of improved photometric and spectroscopic observations for two detached eclipsing binaries at the turnoff of the open cluster NGC 752: the 1.01 day binary DS And and the 15.53 d BD $+$37 410. For DS And, we find $M_1 = 1.692\pm0.004\pm0.010 M_\odot$, $R_1 = 2.185\pm0.004\pm0.008 R_\odot$, $M_2 = 1.184\pm0.001\pm0.003 M_\odot$, and $R_2 = 1.200\pm0.003\pm0.005 R_\odot$. We either confirm or newly identify unusual characteristics of both stars in the binary: the primary star is found to be slightly hotter than the main sequence turn off and there is a more substantial discrepancy in its luminosity compared to models (model luminosities are too large by about 40%), while the secondary star is oversized and cooler compared to other main sequence stars in the same cluster.</description>

GraphNeT is an open-source python framework aimed at providing high quality, user friendly, end-to-end functionality to perform reconstruction tasks at neutrino telescopes using graph neural networks (GNNs). GraphNeT makes it fast and easy to train complex models that can provide event reconstruction with state-of-the-art performance, for arbitrary detector configurations, with inference times that are orders of magnitude faster than traditional reconstruction techniques. GNNs from GraphNeT are flexible enough to be applied to data from all neutrino telescopes, including future projects such as IceCube extensions or P-ONE.</description>

A recent study shows that gravitational scattering of dark matter, in the form of massive objects with mass $m \sim 10^3-10^4M_{\odot}$, could provide a possible solution to alleviate the small-scale structure problems of cold dark matter. The scattering cross section is velocity-dependent so that this scenario can explain why self-interaction of dark matter is significant in dwarf galaxies, but not in massive galaxies and galaxy clusters.</description>

Nearby M dwarf systems currently offer the most favorable opportunities for spectroscopic investigations of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres. The LTT~1445 system is a hierarchical triple of M dwarfs with two known planets orbiting the primary star, LTT~1445A. We observe four transits of the terrestrial world LTT~1445Ab ($R=1.3$ R$\oplus$, $M=2.9$ M$\oplus$) at low resolution with Magellan II/LDSS3C. We use the combined flux of the LTT~1445BC pair as a comparison star, marking the first time that an M dwarf is used to remove telluric variability from time-series observations of another M dwarf.</description>

      <description>First author: Kyle Finner
A dissociative merger is formed by the interplay of ram pressure and gravitational forces, which can lead to a spatial displacement of the dark matter and baryonic components of the recently collided subclusters. CIZA J0107.7+5408 is a nearby (z=0.105) dissociative merger that hosts two X-ray brightness peaks and a bimodal galaxy distribution. Analyzing MMT/Hectospec observations, we investigate the line-of-sight and spatial distribution of cluster galaxies. Utilizing deep, high-resolution \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging and large field-of-view Subaru Hyper-Suprime-Cam observations, we perform a weak-lensing analysis of CIZA J0107.</description>

We present high-precision radial velocities (RVs) from the HARPS-N spectrograph for HD79210 and HD79211, two M0V members of a gravitationally-bound binary system. We detect a planet candidate with a period of $24.421^{+0.016}{-0.017}$ days around HD79211 in these HARPS-N RVs, validating the planet candidate originally identified in CARMENES RV data alone. Using HARPS-N, CARMENES and HIRES RVs spanning a total of 25 years, we further refine the planet candidate parameters to $P=24.</description>

We present KaRMMa 2.0, an updated version of the mass map reconstruction code introduced in Fiedorowicz et al. (2022). KaRMMa is a full-sky Bayesian algorithm for reconstructing weak lensing mass maps from shear data. It forward-models the convergence field as a realization of a lognormal field. The corresponding shear map is calculated using the standard Kaiser-Squires transformation, and compared to observations at the field level. The posterior distribution of maps given the shear data is sampled using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo chains.</description>

In addition, this galaxy shows prominent HI holes, which were analyzed in previous studies. Indeed, the connection between SNRs and HI holes together with their physical implications in the surrounding gas is worth of attention.</description>

The SVOM satellite, to be launched at the end of 2023, is primarily devoted to the multi-wavelength observation of gamma-ray bursts and other higher-energy transients. Thanks to its onboard Microchannel X-ray Telescope and Visible-band Telescope, it is also very well adapted to the electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave events. We discuss the SVOM follow-up strategy for gravitational wave trigger candidates provided by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. In particular, we make use of recent developments of galaxy catalogs adapted to the horizon of gravitational wave detectors to optimise the chance of counterpart discovery.</description>

Dynamical evolution within planetary systems can cause planets to be engulfed by their host stars. Following engulfment, the stellar photosphere abundance pattern will reflect accretion of rocky material from planets. Multi-star systems are excellent environments to search for such abundance trends because stellar companions form from the same natal gas cloud and are thus expected to share primordial chemical compositions to within 0.03$-$0.05 dex. Abundance measurements have occasionally yielded rocky enhancements, but few observations targeted known planetary systems.</description>

      <description>First author: Aida Behmard
Planet engulfment can be inferred from enhancement of refractory elements in the photosphere of the engulfing star following accretion of rocky planetary material. Such refractory enrichments are subject to stellar interior mixing processes, namely thermohaline mixing induced by an inverse mean-molecular-weight gradient between the convective envelope and radiative core. Using MESA stellar models, we quantified the strength and duration of engulfment signatures following planet engulfment. We found that thermohaline mixing dominates during the first $\sim$5$-$45 Myr post-engulfment, weakening signatures by a factor of $\sim$2 before giving way to depletion via gravitational settling on longer timescales.</description>

Hot Jupiters (HJs) are giant planets with orbital periods of the order of a few days with semimajor axis within $\sim$0.1 au. Several theories have been invoked in order to explain the origin of this type of planets, one of them being the high-eccentricity migration. This migration can occur through different high-eccentricity mechanisms. Our investigation focused on six different kinds of high-eccentricity mechanisms, namely, direct dispersion, coplanar, Kozai-Lidov, secular chaos, E1 and E2 mechanisms.</description>

We report on observations of highly-varying Si IV 1402.77 line profiles observed with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) during the M-class flare from 2022 January 18 at an unprecedented 0.8 s cadence. Moment analysis of this line observed in flare ribbon kernels showed that the intensity, Doppler velocity, and non-thermal broadening exhibited variations with periods below 10 s. These variations were found to be correlated with properties of the Gaussian fit to a well-resolved secondary component of the line redshifted by up to 70 km s$^{-1}$, while the primary component was consistently observed near the rest wavelength of the line.</description>

      <description>First author: Justin Atsushi Otter
Post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) have recently and rapidly quenched their star-formation, thus they are an important way to understand how galaxies transition from star-forming late-types to quiescent early-types. The recent discovery of large cold gas reservoirs in PSBs calls into question the theory that galaxies must lose their gas to become quiescent. Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys have revealed two classes of PSBs: central PSBs with central quenching regions and ring PSBs with quenching in their outskirts.</description>

      <description>First author: John B. Biersteker
Some icy moons and small bodies in the solar system are believed to host subsurface liquid water oceans. The interaction of these saline, electrically conductive oceans with time-varying external magnetic fields generates induced magnetic fields. Magnetometry observations of these induced fields in turn enable the detection and characterization of these oceans. We present a framework for characterizing the interiors of icy moons using multi-frequency induction and Bayesian inference applied to magnetometry measurements anticipated from the upcoming Europa Clipper mission.</description>

      <description>First author: Jacob Golomb
The spins of black holes in merging binaries can reveal information related to the formation and evolution of these systems. Combining events to infer the astrophysical distribution of black hole spins allows us to determine the relative contribution from different formation scenarios to the population. Many previous works have modeled spin population distributions using parametric models. While these are valuable approaches when the observed population is small, they make strong assumptions about the shape of the underlying distribution and are highly susceptible to biases due to mismodeling.</description>

We present simulated optical light curves of super-Eddington tidal disruption events (TDEs) using the zero-Bernoulli accretion (ZEBRA) flow model, which proposes that during the super-Eddington phase, the disc is quasi-spherical, radiation-pressure dominated, and accompanied by the production of strong jets. We construct light curves for both on- and off-axis (with respect to the jet) observers to account for the anisotropic nature of the jetted emission.</description>

      <description>First author: Marcin Semczuk
The angular-momentum distribution of classical Cepheids in the outer Milky Way disc is bi-modal with a gap at $L_\mathrm{gap}=2950,\mathrm{km},\mathrm{s}^{-1},\mathrm{kpc}$, corresponding to $R=13,\mathrm{kpc}$, while no similar feature has been found in the general population of disc stars. We show that star formation in multiple spiral arm segments at the same azimuth leads to such multi-modality which quickly dissolves and only shows in young stars. Unlike other explanations, such as a 1:1 orbital resonance with the Galactic bar, this also accounts for the observed steepening of the stellar warp at $L_\mathrm{gap}$, since the adjacent spiral arms represent different parts of the warped gas disc.</description>

In this review article, we briefly outline our current understanding of the physics associated with the HI 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn. We discuss different phases of cosmic dawn as the ambient gas and the background radiations evolve with the redshift. We address the consequences of several possible heating sources and radiation background on the global 21-cm signal. We further review our present perspective of other important aspects of the HI 21-cm signal such as the power spectrum and imaging.</description>

We propose a novel subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) model that uses the virial mass of the main progenitor of each (sub)halo $M_{\rm prog}$ as a proxy of the galaxy stellar mass $M_$ at the time of observation. This $M_{\rm prog}$ model predicts the two-point correlation functions depending on the choice of the epoch $z_{\rm prog}$ at which $M_\mathrm{prog}$ is measured. With $z_{\rm prog}$ as a fitting parameter, we apply the $M_{\rm prog}$ model to the latest observed angular correlation functions of galaxy samples at $z\simeq0.</description>

We study different timing and spectral properties of the new Galactic X-ray transient Swift J1728.9-3613 using NICER and Swift, discovered by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The source went through multiple transitions to different spectral states during the outburst, and the complete evolution created a q-shaped track in the hardness intensity diagram. A partial hysteresis is also observed in the RMS-intensity diagram, which is another well-defined phenomenon of black hole transients.</description>

The short-lived buckling instability is responsible for the formation of at least some box/peanut (B/P) shaped bulges, which are observed in most massive, $z=0$, barred galaxies. Nevertheless, it has also been suggested that B/P bulges form via the slow trapping of stars onto vertically extended resonant orbits. The key difference between these two scenarios is that when the bar buckles, symmetry about the mid-plane is broken for a period of time.</description>

Gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by binary sources are interesting signals for testing gravity on cosmological scales since they allow measurements of the luminosity distance. When followed by electromagnetic counterparts, in particular, they enable a reconstruction of the GW-distance-redshift relation. In the context of several modified gravity (MG) theories, even when requiring that the speed of propagation is equal to that of light, this GW distance differs from the standard electromagnetic luminosity distance due to the presence of a modified friction in the GW propagation.</description>

Impact-induced erosion of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s early crust during accretion of terrestrial bodies can significantly modify the primordial chemical composition of the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE, that is, the composition of the crust added to the present-day mantle). In particular, it can be particularly efficient in altering the abundances of elements having a strong affinity for silicate melts (i.e. incompatible elements) as the early differentiated crust was preferentially enriched in those.</description>

We present the first set of rate coefficients for the rotational excitation of the 7 lowest levels of hydrogen fluoride (HF) induced by collision with water molecules, the dominant collider in cometary comas, in the 5-150 K temperature range. The calculations are performed with a quantum statistical approach from an accurate rigid rotor ab initio interaction potential. Rate coefficients for excitation of HF by electron-impact are also computed, within the Born approximation, in the 10-10,000 K temperature range.</description>

The speeds of isolated pulsars are generally inferred from their observed 2-d velocities on the plane of the sky under the assumption that the unobserved radial velocity is not special, i.e., that the measured 2-d velocity is an isotropic projection of the full 3-d velocity. However, if pulsar spins are preferentially aligned with kicks, then the observer&amp;rsquo;s location is in fact special because the direction of the spin impacts the detectability of the pulsar.</description>

We study the atmospheres of the UHJs WASP-121b and WASP-189b by performing 3D general circulation models (GCMs) of these planets using high temperature correlated-k opacity schemes with ultra-violet (UV) absorbing species included. The GCM results are then post-processed at low and high spectral resolutions and compared to available data.</description>

We use the SOUX sample of $\sim$700 AGN to form average optical-UV-X-rays SEDs on a 2D grid of $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ and $L_{2500}$. We compare these with the predictions of a new AGN SED model, QSOSED, which includes prescriptions for both hot and warm Comptonisation regions as well as an outer standard disc. This predicts the overall SED fairly well for 7.5&amp;lt;log($M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$)&amp;lt;9.0 over a wide range in $L/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$, but at higher masses the outer disc spectra in the model are far too cool to match the data.</description>

Ground-based observing time is precious in the era of exoplanet follow-up and characterization, especially in high-precision radial velocity instruments. Blind-search radial velocity surveys thus require a dedicated observational strategy in order to optimize the observing time, which is particularly crucial for the detection of small rocky worlds at large orbital periods. We develop an algorithm with the purpose of improving the efficiency of radial velocity observations in the context of exoplanet searches, and we apply it to the K-dwarfs Orbited By habitable Exoplanets (KOBE) experiment.</description>

We have searched for thermal gyro-synchrotron radio emission from a sample of five radio-loud stars whose X-ray coronae contain a hot ($T&amp;gt;10^7$ K) thermal component. We used the JVLA to measure Stokes I and V/I spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the frequency range 15&amp;ndash;45 GHz, determining the best-fitting model parameters using power-law and thermal gyro-synchrotron emission models. The SEDs of the three chromospherically active binaries (Algol, UX Arietis, HR 1099) were well-fit by a power-law gyro-synchrotron model, with no evidence for a thermal component.</description>

We develop a new method to infer the temporal, geometric, and energetic properties of galaxy outflows, by combining stellar spectral modeling to infer starburst ages, and absorption lines to measure velocities. If winds are accelerated with time during a starburst event, then these two measurements enable us to solve for the wind radius, similarly to length scales and the Hubble parameter in Big Bang cosmology.</description>

Images obtained with single-conjugate adaptive optics (AO) show spatial variation of the point spread function (PSF) due to both atmospheric anisoplanatism and instrumental aberrations. The poor knowledge of the PSF across the field of view strongly impacts the ability to take full advantage of AO capabilities. The AIROPA project aims to model these PSF variations for the NIRC2 imager at the Keck Observatory. Here, we present the characterization of the instrumental phase aberrations over the entire NIRC2 field of view and we present a new metric for quantifying the quality of the calibration, the fraction of variance unexplained (FVU).</description>

We report the discovery of a dark companion to 2MASS J15274848+3536572 with an orbital period of 6.14 hours. Combining the radial velocity of LAMOST observation and the modelling of the multi-band light curve, one has a mass function of 0.135 Msun, an inclination of 43.94+0.33-0.21, and a mass ratio of 0.58+0.048-0.018, which demonstrate the binary nature of a dark companion with mass of 1.01+-0.08Msun and a main-sequence K star of 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Francesco Zappa
We present a systematic numerical relativity study of the impact of different treatment of microphysics and grid resolution in binary neutron star mergers. We consider series of simulations at multiple resolutions comparing hydrodynamics, neutrino leakage scheme, leakage augmented with the M0 scheme and the more consistent M1 transport scheme. Additionally, we consider the impact of a sub-grid scheme for turbulent viscosity. We find that viscosity helps to stabilise the remnant against gravitational collapse but grid resolution has a larger impact than microphysics on the remnant&amp;rsquo;s stability.</description>

We characterize the chemical and physical conditions in an outflowing high-velocity cloud in the inner Galaxy. We report a super-solar metallicity of [O/H] = $+0.36\pm0.12$ for the high-velocity cloud at $v_\mathrm{LSR}$ = 125.6 km s$^{-1}$ toward the star HD 156359 ($l$ = 328.$^{\circ}$7, $b$ = $-$14.$^{\circ}$5, $d$ = 9 kpc, $z$ = $-$2.3 kpc). Using archival observations from FUSE, HST STIS, and ESO FEROS we measure high-velocity absorption in H I, O I, C II, N II, Si II, Ca II, Si III, Fe III, C IV, Si IV, N V, and O VI.</description>

ALTA project has been active since 2016, providing, at LBT observatory site, forecasts of atmospheric parameters, such as temperature, wind speed and direction, relative humidity and precipitable water vapor, and optical turbulence parameters, such as seeing, wavefront coherence time and isoplanatic angle with the final goal to support nightly the science operation of the LBT. Besides to the forecasts, during the years ALTA has been collecting statistics on the atmospheric conditions which can be used to draw a very accurate characterization of the climatology of the telescope site located on top of Mount Graham, Arizona.</description>

Interaction of three-dimensional magnetic fields, turbulence, and self-gravity in the molecular cloud is crucial in understanding star formation but has not been addressed so far. In this work, we target the low-mass star-forming region L1688 and use the spectral emissions of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, and H I, as well as polarized dust emissions. To obtain the 3D direction of the magnetic field, we employ the polarization fraction analysis developed in Hu &amp;amp; Lazarian (2022).</description>

We present the results of the broadband X-ray spectral analysis of simultaneous NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of four nearby Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates selected from the Swift-Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) 150-month catalog. This work is part of a larger effort to identify and characterize all Compton-thick (NH &amp;gt;= 10^24 cm^-2) AGN in the local Universe (z &amp;lt; 0.05). We used three physically motivated models &amp;ndash; MYTorus, borus02, and UXClumpy &amp;ndash; to fit and characterize these sources.</description>

Context. With the detection of thousands of exoplanets, characterising their dynamical evolution in detail represents a key step in the understanding of their formation. Studying the dissipation of tides occurring both in the host star and in the planets is of great relevance in order to investigate the distribution of the angular momentum occurring among the objects populating the system and to studying the evolution of the orbital parameters.</description>

      <description>First author: David H. W. Glass
The content and distribution of cool interstellar medium (ISM, &amp;lt;30K) can indicate the evolutionary mechanisms that transform late type to early type galaxies (ETGs). To investigate this, ALMA observations of 12CO[2-1] line emission were obtained for five dusty ETGs from a complete sample in low-density environments. Four of the ETGs have massive (approximately 10^9 Msolar), extended molecular gas reservoirs with effective radii of approximately 3 to 5 kpc.</description>

      <description>First author: Nestor Mirabal
The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, E $&amp;gt; 10^{18}$ eV) is one of the great mysteries of modern astrophysics. It has been suggested that UHECRs could be accelerated in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and engine-driven supernovae (SNe). Here we report the discovery of a 1.4 teraelectronvolt (TeV) photon offset 0.97$^{\circ}$ from the site of the nearby (36.9 megaparsecs) GRB 980425/SN 1998bw explosion. The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected the TeV emission on 17 November 2018, more than 20 years after the original GRB 980425/SN 1998bw trigger.</description>

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intense bursts of radio emission with durations of milliseconds. Although researchers have found them happening frequently all over the sky, they are still in the dark to understand what causes the phenomena because the existing radio observatories have encountered certain challenges during the discovery of FRB progenitors. The construction of Bustling Universe Radio Survey Telescope in Taiwan (BURSTT) is being proposed to solve these challenges.</description>

We report on the discovery of two new molecules, HCCCHCCC and HCCCCS, towards the starless core TMC-1 in the Taurus region from the QUIJOTE line survey in the 31.1-50.2 GHz frequency range. We identify a total of twenty-nine lines of HCCCHCCC and six rotational transitions of HCCCCS. The rotational quantum numbers range from Ju=10 up to 15 and Ka &amp;lt;=2 for HCCCHCCC and Ju=21/2 up to 31/2 for HCCCCS.</description>

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and fullerenes play a major role in the physics and chemistry of the interstellar medium. Based on a number of recent experimental and theoretical investigations we developed a model in which PAHs are subject to photo-dissociation (carbon and hydrogen loss) and hydrogenation. We take into account that dehydrogenated PAHs may fold into closed structures &amp;ndash; fullerenes. Fullerenes, in their turn, can be also hydrogenated, becoming fulleranes, and photo-dissociated, losing carbon and hydrogen atoms.</description>

The introduction of the Rossby number (R$_0$), which incorporates the convective turnover time ($\tau$), in 1984 was a pioneering idea for understanding the correlation between stellar rotation and activity. The convective turnover time, which cannot be measured directly, is often inferred using existing $\tau$-mass or $\tau$-color relations, typically established based on an ensemble of different types of stars by assuming that $\tau$ is a function of mass.</description>

The recent detections of binary stellar mass black hole mergers by the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations suggest that such mergers are common occurrences. Galaxy mergers further indicate that supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies also merge and are typically expected to have had at least one merger in their lifetime, possibly many. In the presence of a jet, these mergers are almost always accompanied by a change of the jet direction and a connected jet precession motion, leading to interactions of the jet with ambient matter and producing very high-energy particles, and consequently high-energy gamma-rays and neutrinos.</description>

      <description>First author: Jiaqing Bi
As one of the most commonly observed disk substructures, dust rings from high-resolution disk surveys appear to have different radial widths. Recent observations on PDS 70 and AB Aur reveal not only planets in the disk, but also the accompanying wide dust rings. We use three-dimensional dust-and-gas disk simulations to study whether gap-opening planets are responsible for the large ring width in disk observations. We find that gap-opening planets can widen rings of dust trapped at the pressure bump via planetary perturbations, even with the mid-plane dust-to-gas ratio approaching order unity and with the dust back-reaction accounted for.</description>

      <description>First author: Mihir Kulkarni
Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is a proposed modification for the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model motivated by small-scale discrepancies in low-mass galaxies. Composed of ultra-light (mass $\sim 10^{-22}$ eV) axions with kpc-scale de Broglie wavelengths, this is one of a class of candidates that predicts that the first collapsed objects form in relatively massive dark matter halos. This implies that the formation history of the first stars and galaxies would be very different, potentially placing strong constraints on such models.</description>

While awaiting direct velocity measurement of gas motions in the hot intracluster medium, we rely on indirect probes, including gas perturbations in galaxy clusters. Using a sample of $\sim 80$ clusters in different dynamic states from Omega500 cosmological simulations, we examine scaling relations between the fluctuation amplitudes of gas density, $\delta\rho/\rho$, pressure, $\delta P/P$, X-ray surface brightness, Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) y-parameter, and the characteristic Mach number of gas motions, $M_{\rm 1d}$.</description>

Both the dynamics and the observational properties of relativistic jets are determined by their interaction with the ambient medium. A crucial role is played by the contact discontinuity at the jet boundary, which in the presence of jet collimation may become subject to Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) and Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI). Here, we study the evolution of these instabilities in non-magnetized relativistic jets using special relativistic three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations.</description>

It is postulated in Einstein&amp;rsquo;s relativity that the speed of light in vacuum is a constant for all observers. However, the effect of quantum gravity could bring an energy dependence of light speed, and a series of previous researches on high-energy photon events from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) suggest a light speed variation $v(E)=c\left(1-E / E_{\mathrm{LV}}\right)$ with $E_{\mathrm{LV}}=3.6 \times 10^{17} ~\mathrm{GeV}$.

Although high energetic radiation from flares is a potential threat to exoplanet atmospheres and may lead to surface sterilization, it might also provide the extra energy for low-mass stars needed to trigger and sustain prebiotic chemistry. We investigate two flares on TRAPPIST-1, an ultra-cool dwarf star that hosts seven exoplanets of which three lie within its habitable zone. The flares are detected in all four passbands of the MuSCAT2 allowing a determination of their temperatures and bolometric energies.</description>

Magnetars are a special subset of the isolated neutron star family, with X-ray and radio emission mainly powered by the decay of their immense magnetic fields. Many attributes of magnetars remain poorly understood: spin-down glitches or the sudden reductions in the star&amp;rsquo;s angular momentum, radio bursts reminiscent of extra-galactic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and transient pulsed radio emission lasting months to years. Here we unveil the detection of a large spin-down glitch event ($|\Delta\nu/\nu| = 5.</description>

We simulate the formation and collapse of prestellar cores at few-AU resolution in a set of radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) using the grid-based code RAMSES-RT. We adopt, for the first time to our best knowledge, realistic initial/boundary conditions by zooming-in onto individual massive prestellar cores within the GMC. We identify two distinct modes of fragmentation: &amp;ldquo;quasi-spherical&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;filamentary&amp;rdquo;. In both modes the fragments eventually become embedded in a quasi-steady accretion disk or toroid with radii ~ 500-5000 AU and opening angles $H/R \sim 0.</description>

Hierarchical Bayesian inference is an essential tool for studying the population properties of compact binaries with gravitational waves. The basic premise is to infer the unknown prior distribution of binary black hole and/or neutron star parameters such component masses, spin vectors, and redshift. These distributions shed light on the fate of massive stars, how and where binaries are assembled, and the evolution of the Universe over cosmic time.</description>

Upcoming cosmological surveys will provide unprecedented amount of data, which will require innovative statistical methods to maximize the scientific exploitation. Standard cosmological analyses based on abundances, two-point and higher-order statistics of cosmic tracers have been widely used to investigate the properties of the cosmic web and Large Scale Structure. However, these statistics can only exploit a subset of the entire information content available. Our goal is thus to implement new data analysis techniques based on machine learning to extract cosmological information through forward modelling, by directly exploiting the spatial coordinates and other observed properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters.</description>

We undertook a search for new dwarf galaxies in the vicinity of relatively isolated nearby galaxies with distances $D &amp;lt; 12$ Mpc and stellar masses in the $2\times10^{11}-3\times10^8~M_{\odot}$ interval, using the data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. Around the 46 considered Local Volume galaxies, $67$ new candidates for satellites of these galaxies were found. About half of them are classified as spheroidal dwarfs of low surface brightness.</description>

      <description>First author: Alfio Bonanno
The presence of possible correlations between stellar rotation rate $\Omega$ and the frequency of the activity cycle $\omega_\mathrm{cyc}$ is still much debated. We implement a new Bayesian classification algorithm based on a simultaneous regression analysis of multiple scaling laws and we demonstrate the existence of two different scalings in the $\log_{10} \omega_\mathrm{cyc}$ &amp;ndash; $\log_{10} \Omega$ plane for an extended Mt.~Wilson sample of 67 stars. Thanks to metallicity measurements obtained from both ESA Gaia and high-resolution spectroscopy, we argue that the origin of this dichotomy is likely related to the chemical composition: stars whose magnetic cycle frequency increases with rotation rate are less metallic than stars whose magnetic cycle frequency decreases with stellar rotation rates.</description>

Halo Models of large scale structure provide powerful and indispensable tools for phenomenological understanding of the clustering of matter in the Universe. While the halo model builds structures out of the superposition of haloes, defining halo profiles in their outskirts - beyond their virial radii - becomes increasingly ambiguous, as one cannot assign matter to individual haloes in a clear way. In this paper, we tackle this question by using numerical N-body simulations to find a systematic definition of mean halo profile that can be extended to large radii.</description>

      <description>First author: Arghyadeep Basu
The neutral hydrogen 21 cm line is an excellent tracer of the atomic interstellar medium in the cold and the warm phases. Combined 21 cm emission and absorption observations are very useful to study the properties of the gas over a wide range of density and temperature. In this work, we have used 21 cm absorption spectra from recent interferometric surveys, along with the corresponding emission spectra from earlier single dish surveys to study the properties of the atomic gas in the Milky Way.</description>

Most secular effects produced by stellar bars strongly depend on the pattern speed. Unfortunately, it is also the most difficult observational parameter to estimate. In this work, we measured the bar pattern speed of 97 Milky-Way Analogue galaxies from the MaNGA survey using the Tremaine-Weinberg method. The sample was selected by constraining the stellar mass and morphological type. We improve our measurements by weighting three independent estimates of the disc position angle.</description>

Using ion measurements from Ultra-Low-Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) observations onboard Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS) observations onboard the Solar Terrestrial Observatory (STEREO)-A and STEREO-B spacecraft, we have identified 854 3He-rich time periods between 1997 September and 2021 March. We include all event types with observed 3He enhancements such as corotating interaction regions (CIRs), gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events, interplanetary shocks, and impulsive SEP events.</description>

      <description>First author: Hajime Inoue
We study ejection mechanisms for two kinds of steady jets: one observed from black hole binaries in the low/hard state and the other from SS433. The specific energy of the ejected gas is required to be positive for the jets to get to infinity, while that of the accreted gas is naively considered to be negative at the outermost boundary of the accretion flow. To reconcile the opposite sign of the specific energies, we propose a situation where two layers exist in the accretion flow and one layer receives energy from the other sufficiently for the specific energy to be positive.</description>

The abundance of galaxy clusters is a sensitive probe to the amplitude of matter density fluctuations, the total amount of matter in the Universe as well as its expansion history. Inferring correct values and accurate uncertainties of cosmological parameters requires accurate knowledge of cluster abundance statistics, encoded in the likelihood function. In this paper, we test the accuracy of cluster abundance likelihoods used in the literature, namely the Poisson and Gaussian likelihoods as well as the more complete description of the Gauss-Poisson Compound likelihood.</description>

We analyze spectra of a gravitationally lensed galaxy, known as the Sunburst Arc, that is leaking ionizing photons, also known as the Lyman continuum (LyC). Magnification from gravitational lensing permits the galaxy to be spatially resolved into one region that leaks ionizing photons, and several that do not. Rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectra from Magellan target ten different regions along the lensed Arc, including six multiple images of the LyC leaking region, as well as four regions that do not show LyC emission.</description>

Stars are born with magnetic fields, but the distribution of their initial field strengths remains uncertain. We combine observations with theoretical models of magnetic field evolution to infer the initial distribution of magnetic fields for AB stars in the mass range of 1.6 - 3.4 M$_{\odot}$. We tested a variety of distributions with different shapes and found that a distribution with a mean of $\sim$800 G and a full width of $\sim$600 G is most consistent with the observed fraction of strongly magnetized stars as a function of mass.</description>

In the previous paper [arXiv:2210.10435], the nonlinear perturbation theory of cosmological density field is generalized to include the tensor-valued bias of astronomical objects, such as spins and shapes of galaxies and any other tensors of arbitrary ranks which are associated with objects that we can observe. We apply this newly developed method to explicitly calculate nonlinear power spectra and correlation functions both in real space and in redshift space.</description>

We design a new observable, the expansion rate fluctuation $\eta$, to characterize deviations from the linear relation between redshift and distance in the local universe. We also show how to compress the resulting signal into spherical harmonic coefficients in order to better decipher the structure and symmetries of the anisotropies in the local expansion rate. We apply this analysis scheme to several public catalogs of redshift-independent distances, the Cosmicflows-3 and Pantheon data sets, covering the redshift range $0.</description>

Anomalous large-angle cosmic microwave background anisotropies motivate further searches for cosmic topology. We demonstrate that for generic topologies of spatially flat spacetimes, off-diagonal correlations between microwave background harmonic coefficients over a wide range of scales encode significant topological information, even if the topology scale substantially exceeds the diameter of the observable Universe. Observational searches have so far considered only a small subset of testable topologies, and current limits on the topology scale are much weaker than generally understood.</description>

To this aim, we critically make use of Gaia data to derive their distances and associated uncertainties.</description>

The spectacular outbursts of energy associated with supernovae (SNe) have long motivated research into their potentially hazardous effects on Earth and analogous environments. Much of this research has focused primarily on the atmospheric damage associated with the prompt arrival of ionizing photons within days or months of the initial outburst, and the high-energy cosmic rays that arrive thousands of years after the explosion. In this study, we turn the focus to persistent X-ray emission, arising in certain SNe that have interactions with a dense circumstellar medium, and observed months and/or years after the initial outburst.</description>

Understanding stellar composition is fundamental not only to our comprehension of the galaxy, especially chemical evolution, but it can also shed light on the interior structure and mineralogy of exoplanets, which are formed from the same material as their host stars. Unfortunately, the underlying mathematics describing stellar mass fractions and stellar elemental abundances is difficult to parse, fragmented across the literature, and contains vexing omissions that makes any calculation far from trivial, especially for non-experts.</description>

Young eclipsing binaries (EBs) are powerful probes of early stellar evolution. Current models are unable to simultaneously reproduce the measured and derived properties that are accessible for EB systems (e.g., mass, radius, temperature, luminosity). In this study we add a benchmark EB to the pre-main sequence population with our characterization of TOI 450 (TIC 77951245). Using \gaia\ astrometry to identify its comoving, coeval companions, we confirm TOI 450 is a member of the $\sim$40 Myr Columba association.</description>

The multi-messenger detection of GW170817 showed that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are progenitors of (at least some) short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and that short GRB jets (and their afterglows) can have structures (and observational properties) more complex than predicted by the standard top-hat jet scenario. Indeed, the emission from the structured jet launched in GW170817 peaked in the radio band (cm wavelengths) at about 100 d since merger - a timescale much longer than the typical time span of radio follow-up observations of short GRBs.</description>

Understanding the formation and evolution of ring galaxies, galaxies with an atypical ring-like structure, will improve understanding of black holes and galaxy dynamics as a whole. Current catalogs of rings are extremely limited: manual analysis takes months to accumulate an appreciable sample of rings and existing computational methods are vastly limited in terms of accuracy and detection rate. Without a sizable sample of rings, further research into their properties is severely restricted.</description>

We use the spectra of the X-Shooter instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) to better understand the nature of 3 accreting binaries (IGR J10101-5654, IGR J11435-6109 and IGR J12489-6243) discovered by INTEGRAL.</description>

We focus on galaxies with very old stellar populations (VO galaxies), typically found in the centers of clusters and groups, and search for such galaxies in the lowest global density environments, watersheds between superclusters. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey MAIN galaxy sample to calculate the luminosity-density field and get global density field, to determine groups and filaments, and to obtain data on galaxy properties.</description>

We report the detection of three large millimeter flaring events from the nearby Sun-like, $\epsilon$ Eridani, found in archival ALMA 12m and ACA observations at 1.33 mm taken from 2015 January 17-18 and 2016 October 24-November 23, respectively. This is the first time that flares have been detected from a Sun-like star at millimeter wavelengths. The largest flare among our data was detected in the ALMA observations on 2015 January 17 from 20:09:10.</description>

      <description>First author: Damien Beaulieu
We present star formation rates based on cold and ionized gas measurements of Mrk 266 (NGC 5256), a system composed of two colliding gas-rich galaxies, each hosting an active galactic nucleus. Using $^{12}$CO (1-0) observations with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA), we find a total H$2$ mass in the central region of $1.1\pm0.3\times10^{10}$ $M\odot$ which leads to a possible future star formation rate of $25\pm10 M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.</description>

The Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR) has been strongly endorsed as a top community priority by both Astronomy &amp;amp; Astrophysics Decadal Surveys and Solar &amp;amp; Space Physics Decadal Surveys in the past two decades. Although it was developed to a high state of readiness in previous years (it went through a CATE analysis and was declared ``doable now&amp;quot;), the NSF has not had the funding mechanisms in place to fund this mid-scale program.</description>

We have identified 7 objects in Gaia Early DR3 associated with 6 International Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) pulsars. We combine both pulsar timing based parallax distance measurements with Gaia parallaxes to their companions, in an effort to improve distance measurements. We confirm previous cross-match findings for pulsars J0437-4715, J1012+5307, J1024-0719, J1732-5049, and J1843-1113. We no longer find the companion to J1949+3106 even though it was detected with a $&amp;gt; 3\sigma$ confidence in Gaia DR2.</description>

      <description>First author: Egidijus Kukstas
Recent observations have shown that the environmental quenching of galaxies at z ~ 1 is qualitatively different to that in the local Universe. However, the physical origin of these differences has not yet been elucidated. In addition, while low-redshift comparisons between observed environmental trends and the predictions of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are now routine, there have been relatively few comparisons at higher redshifts to date. Here we confront three state-of-the-art suites of simulations (BAHAMAS+MACSIS, EAGLE+Hydrangea, IllustrisTNG) with state-of-the-art observations of the field and cluster environments from the COSMOS/UltraVISTA and GOGREEN surveys, respectively, at z ~ 1 to assess the realism of the simulations and gain insight into the evolution of environmental quenching.</description>

We modelled dust grain-size distributions for carbonaceous and silicates dust, as well as for free-flying iron nanoparticles in the environment of a $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) afterglow, GRB 180325A. This GRB, at $z=2.2486$, has an unambiguous detection of the 2175 \r{A} extinction feature with $R_V=4.58$ and $A_V=1.58$. In addition to silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and graphite, we used iron nanoparticles grain-size distributions for the first time to model the observed extinction curve of GRB 180325A.</description>

Here, we present a systematic study of 59 stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) (including Type IIb, Ib, Ic, and transitional events) to map a possible reason for the so-called mass-discrepancy problem. In this scenario, we assume the tension between the estimated ejected masses from early- and late-time light curves (LC) is due to approximations generally used in analytical models. First, we examine the assumption that the R-band light curve is indeed a good approximation of the bolometric light curve.</description>

We are using archived data from HST of transiting exoplanet L~98-59~b to place constraints on its potentially hot atmosphere. We analyze the data from five transit visits and extract the final combined transmission spectrum using Iraclis. Then we use the inverse atmospheric retrieval code TauREx to analyze the combined transmission spectrum. There is a weak absorption feature near 1.40~$\mu m$ and 1.55~$\mu m$ in the transmission spectrum, which can be modeled by a cloudy atmosphere with abundant HCN.</description>

Double white dwarfs (DWDs) will be the most numerous gravitational-wave (GW) sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Most of the Galactic DWDs will be unresolved and will superpose to form a confusion noise foreground, the dominant LISA noise source around $\sim 0.5\mathrm{-}3,\mathrm{mHz}$. A small fraction of these sources will stand out from the background and be individually detectable. Uniquely among GW sources, a handful of these binaries will be known in advance from electromagnetic observations and will be guaranteed sources of detectable GWs in the LISA band; these are known as verification binaries (VBs).</description>

We present an expansion of FLEET, a machine learning algorithm optimized to select transients that are most likely to be tidal disruption events (TDEs). FLEET is based on a random forest algorithm trained on the light curves and host galaxy information of 4,779 spectroscopically classified transients. For transients with a probability of being a TDE, \ptde$&amp;gt;0.5$, we can successfully recover TDEs with a $\approx40$% completeness and a $\approx30$% purity when using the first 20 days of photometry, or a similar completeness and $\approx50$% purity when including 40 days of photometry.</description>

In this paper, we extend our previous study \cite{DelPopolo2021} on the Lemaitre-Tolman (LT) model showing how the prediction of the model changes when the equation of state parameter ($w$) of dark energy is modified. In the previous study, it was considered that dark energy was merely constituted by the cosmological constant. In this paper, as in the previous study, we also took into account the effect of angular momentum and dynamical friction ($J\eta$ LT model) that modifies the evolution of a perturbation, initially moving with the Hubble flow.</description>

      <description>First author: Dhruv Pathak
The spin-down limit of the continuous gravitational wave strain (assuming pulsars as triaxial rotators) depends upon the value of the intrinsic spin frequency derivative of the pulsar, among other parameters. In order to get more accurate intrinsic spin frequency derivative values, dynamical effects contributing to the measured spin frequency derivative values must be estimated via more realistic approaches. In this work, we calculate improved values of the spin-down limit of the gravitational wave strain (assuming pulsars as triaxial rotators) for a set of 237 pulsars for which a targeted search for continuous gravitational waves was carried out by the LVK Collaboration, recently.</description>

We continue examining statistical data assimilation (SDA), an inference methodology, to infer solutions to neutrino flavor evolution, for the first time using real - rather than simulated - data. The model represents neutrinos streaming from the Sun&amp;rsquo;s center and undergoing a Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance in flavor space, due to the radially-varying electron number density. The model neutrino energies are chosen to correspond to experimental bins in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) and Borexino experiments, which measure electron-flavor survival probability at Earth.</description>

We develop an optimal Bayesian solution for jointly inferring secondary signals in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) originating from gravitational lensing and from patchy screening during the epoch of reionization. This method is able to extract full information content from the data, improving upon previously considered quadratic estimators for lensing and screening. We forecast constraints using the Marginal Unbiased Score Expansion (MUSE) method, and show that they are largely dominated by CMB polarization, and depend on the exact details of reionization.</description>

Magnetic reconnection is one of the major particle acceleration processes in space and astrophysical plasmas. Low-energy supra-thermal particles emitted by magnetic reconnection are a source of ionisation for circumstellar discs, influencing their chemical, thermal and dynamical evolution. The aim of this work is to propose a first investigation to evaluate how energetic particles can propagate in the circumstellar disc of a T Tauri star and how they affect the ionisation rate of the disc plasma.</description>

To date, over 500 short-period rocky planets with equilibrium temperatures above 1500 K have been discovered. Such planets are expected to support magma oceans, providing a direct interface between the interior and atmosphere. This provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into their interior compositions through atmospheric observations. A key process in doing such work is the vapor outgassing from the lava surface. LavAtmos is an open-source code that calculates the equilibrium chemical composition of vapor above a melt for a given composition and temperature.</description>

Radio galaxies are luminous structures created by the jets of supermassive black holes, and consist of atomic nuclei, relativistic electrons, and magnetic fields. In exceptional cases, radio galaxies attain cosmological, megaparsec extents - and thus turn into giants. Giants embody the most extreme known mechanism through which galaxies can impact the Cosmic Web around them. The triggers of giant growth remain a mystery.</description>

Radiation pressure-driven outflows from luminous accreting supermassive black holes are an important part of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The effective Eddington limit, based on absorption of radiation by dust, not electron scattering, is revealed in the plane of AGN absorption column density $N_{\mathrm{H}}$ as a function of Eddington fraction $\lambda_{\mathrm{Edd}} = L_{\mathrm{bol}}/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$, where a lack of objects is seen in the region where the effective limit is exceeded.</description>

Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence regulates the transfer of energy from large to small scales in many astrophysical systems, including the solar atmosphere. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations with unprecedentedly large magnetic Reynolds number to reveal how rapid reconnection of magnetic field lines changes the classical paradigm of the turbulent energy cascade. By breaking elongated current sheets into chains of small magnetic flux ropes (or plasmoids), magnetic reconnection leads to a new range of turbulent energy cascade, where the rate of energy transfer is controlled by the growth rate of the plasmoids.</description>

We report a spectroscopic study on red supergiant stars (RSGs) in the irregular dwarf galaxy IC 1613 in the Local Group. We derive the effective temperatures ($T_\mathrm{eff}$) and metallicities of 14 RSGs by synthetic spectral fitting to the spectra observed with the MMIRS instrument on the MMT telescope for a wavelength range from 1.16 $\mu$m to 1.23 $\mu$m. A weak bimodal distribution of the RSG metallicity centered on the [Fe/H]=$-0.</description>

In the near future, wide field surveys will discover 1000&amp;rsquo;s of new strongly lensed quasars, and these will be monitored with unprecedented cadence by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Many of these will undergo caustic-crossing microlensing events over the 10-year LSST survey, in which a sharp caustic feature from a stellar body in the lensing galaxy crosses the inner accretion disk. Caustic-crossing events offer the unique opportunity to probe the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole for 100s of quasars with multi-platform follow-up triggered by LSST monitoring.</description>

      <description>First author: Nestor Mirabal
The origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the most mystifying issues in astroparticle physics. It has been suggested that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are excellent acceleration sites for cosmic rays. The propagation of UHECRs from the GRB host galaxy to the Earth should generate delayed secondary photons and neutrinos. Here we present a dedicated search for delayed UHECR and neutrino emission centered around the position of nearby GRB 980425/SN 1998bw.</description>

We investigate the physical mechanism that decides the saturation level of turbulence in collapsing gas clouds. We perform a suite of high-resolution numerical simulations following the collapse of turbulent gas clouds with various effective polytropic exponents $\gamma_{\rm eff}$, initial Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}0$, and initial turbulent seeds. Equating the energy injection rate by gravitational contraction and the dissipation rate of turbulence, we obtain an analytic expression of the saturation level of turbulence, and compare it with the numerical results.</description>

We present MMT spectroscopic observations of two massive galaxy cluster candidates at redshift $z\sim0.07$ that show extended and diffuse X-ray emission in the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) images. The targets were selected from a previous catalog of 303 newly-identified cluster candidates with the similar properties using the intra-cluster medium emission. Using the new MMT Hectospec data and SDSS archival spectra, we identify a number of member galaxies for the two targets and confirm that they are galaxy clusters at $z=0.</description>

Strong lensing at the galaxy-scale is useful for numerous applications in Astrophysics and Cosmology. Some of the principal applications are studying the mass structure of elliptical galaxies, their formation and evolution, constraining the stellar initial mass function, and measuring cosmological parameters. Since the first discovery of a galaxy-scale strong lens in the eighties, this field has come a long way in terms of data quality and availability, and techniques to model the data.</description>

In November 2019 we began operating FLEET (Finding Luminous and Exotic Extragalactic Transients), a machine learning algorithm designed to photometrically identify Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) in transient alert streams. Using FLEET, we spectroscopically classified 21 of the 50 SLSNe identified worldwide between November 2019 and January 2022. Based on our original algorithm, we anticipated that FLEET would achieve a purity of about 50% for transients with a probability of being a SLSN, \pslsn$&amp;gt;0.</description>

When Type Ia supernovae are used to infer cosmological parameters, their luminosities are compared to those from a homogeneous cosmology. In this note we propose a test to examine to what degree SN Ia have been observed on lines of sight where the average matter density is \textit{not} representative of the homogeneous background. We use a modification to the Tripp estimator to explicitly de-lens SN Ia magnitudes, and show that it reduces scatter.</description>

In order to extract maximal information about cosmology from the large-scale structure of the Universe, one needs to use every bit of signals that can be observed. Beyond the spatial distributions of astronomical objects, the spatial correlations of tensor fields, such as galaxy spins and shapes, are ones of promising sources that we can access in the era of large surveys in near future. The perturbation theory is a powerful tool to analytically describe the behaviors and evolutions of correlation statistics for a given cosmology.</description>

Upcoming large galaxy surveys will subject the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, to new precision tests. These can be tightened considerably if theoretical models of galaxy formation are available that can predict galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing on the full range of measurable scales throughout volumes as large as those of the surveys and with sufficient flexibility that uncertain aspects of the underlying astrophysics can be marginalised over.</description>

KT Eridani was a very fast nova in 2009 peaking at V=5.42 mag. We marshal large data sets of photometry to finally work out the nature of KT Eri. From the TESS light curve, as confirmed with our radial velocity curve, we find an orbital period of 2.61595 days. With our 272 spectral energy distributions from simultaneous BVRIJHK measures, the companion star has a temperature of 6200$\pm$500 K.</description>

Modeling the 21cm global signal from the Cosmic Dawn is challenging due to the many poorly constrained physical processes that come into play. We address this problem using the semi-analytical code &amp;ldquo;Cosmic Archaeology Tool&amp;rdquo; (CAT). CAT follows the evolution of dark matter halos tracking their merger history and provides an ab initio description of their baryonic evolution, starting from the formation of the first (Pop III) stars and black holes (BHs) in mini-halos at z &amp;gt; 20.</description>

The dynamics of galaxies in an expanding universe is often determined for gravitational and dark matter in an Einstein-de Sitter universe, or alternatively by modifying the gravitational long-range attractions in the Newtonian dynamics (MOND). Here the time evolution of galaxies is determined by simulations of systems with pure gravitational forces by classical Molecular Dynamic simulations.

We investigate the dynamics of clumps that coexisted with/in advection-dominated accretion flows by considering thermal conductivity. Thermal conduction can be one of the effective factors in the energy transportation of ADAFs; hence it may indirectly affect the dynamics of clumps by means of a contact force between them and their host medium. We first study the ensemble of clumps by assuming them as collision-less particles and secondly we find the orbital motion of these clouds as individuals.</description>

Our simulations are three-dimensional and performed in spherical coordinates. Our model covers the neutron star core and includes crust where the magnetic field decay is due to Ohmic decay. We discover an instability of poloidal magnetic field under the influence of ambipolar diffusion.</description>

Multiply lensed sources experience a relative time delay in the arrival of photons. This effect can be used to measure absolute distances and the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and is known as time-delay cosmography. The methodology is independent of the local distance ladder and early-universe physics and provides a precise and competitive measurement of $H_0$. With upcoming observatories, time-delay cosmography can provide a 1% precision measurement of $H_0$ and can decisively shed light on the current reported &amp;lsquo;Hubble tension&amp;rsquo;.</description>

We study the long-term radial transport of micron to mm-size grain in protostellar disks (PSDs) based on diffusion and viscosity coefficients measured from 3D global stratified-disk simulations with a Lagrangian hydrodynamic method. While gas-drag tend to transport dust species radially inwards, stochastic diffusion can spread a considerable fraction of dust radially outwards (upstream) depending on the nature of turbulence. In gravitationally unstable disks, we measure a high radial diffusion coefficient Dr with little dependence on altitude.</description>

The radiosotope $^{44}$Ti is produced through $\alpha$-rich freezeout and explosive helium burning in type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In this paper, we discuss how the detection of $^{44}$Ti, either through late-time light curves of SNe Ia, or directly via gamma rays, can uniquely constrain the origin of SNe Ia. In particular, building upon recent advances in the hydrodynamical simulation of helium-ignited double white dwarf binaries, we demonstrate that the detection of $^{44}$Ti in a nearby SN Ia or in a young galactic supernova remnant (SNR) can discriminate between the double-detonation and double-degenerate channels of sub-Chandrasekhar (sub-$M_{\rm Ch}$) and near-Chandrasekhar (near-$M_{\rm Ch}$) SNe Ia.</description>

      <description>First author: Brandon T. Radzom
The Hawaii Survey Field SSA22 is the fourth deepest Chandra X-ray field. To allow for the fullest exploration of this field, we present new optical spectroscopy from Keck/DEIMOS and Keck/LRIS, which, in combination with the literature, brings the spectroscopic completeness of the 2&amp;ndash;8 keV sample to 62%. We also make optical spectral classifications and estimate photometric redshifts for the sources without spectroscopic redshifts. We then determine hard X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for the full sample of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), as well as for the broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs) and the non-BLAGNs separately.</description>

      <description>First author: Tomokage Yoneyama
2S 0921$-$630 is an eclipsing low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) with an orbital period of $\sim$ 9 days. Past X-ray observations have revealed that 2S 0921$-$630 has an extended accretion disk corona (ADC), from which most of the X-rays from the system are emitted. We report the result of our Suzaku archival data analysis of 2S 0921$-$630. The average X-ray spectrum is reproduced with a blackbody emission ($kT_{\rm bb} \sim 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Marie Gueguen
Measuring the rate at which the universe expands at a given time &amp;ndash; the &amp;lsquo;Hubble constant&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; has been a topic of controversy since the first measure of its expansion by Edwin Hubble in the 1920&amp;rsquo;s. As early as the 1970&amp;rsquo;s, Sandage et de Vaucouleurs have been arguing about the adequate methodology for such a measurement. Should astronomers focus only on their best indicators, e.g., the Cepheids, and improve the precision of this measurement based on a unique object to the best possible?</description>

      <description>First author: Misa Ogata
We present a new formulation for numerically obtaining axisymmetric equilibrium structures of rotating stars in two spatial dimensions. With a view to apply it to the secular evolution of rotating stars, we base it on the Lagrangian description, i.e., we solve the force-balance equations to find the spatial positions of fluid elements endowed individually with a mass, specific entropy and angular momentum. The system of nonlinear equations obtained by finite-differencing the basic equations are solved with the W4 method, which is a new multi-dimensional root-finding scheme of our own devising.</description>

      <description>First author: James D. Windsor
Clouds are ubiquitous, &amp;ndash; ,they arise for every solar system planet that possesses an atmosphere and have also been suggested as a leading mechanism for obscuring spectral features in exoplanet observations. As exoplanet observations continue to improve, there is a need for efficient and general planetary climate models that appropriately handle the possible cloudy atmospheric environments that arise on these worlds. We generate a new 1D radiative-convective terrestrial planet climate model that self-consistently handles patchy clouds through a parameterized microphysical treatment of condensation and sedimentation processes.</description>

      <description>First author: Alessandra Corsi
The dividing line between gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and ordinary stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is yet to be fully understood. Observationally mapping the variety of ejecta outcomes (ultra-relativistic, mildly-relativistic or non-relativistic) in SNe of Type Ic with broad lines (Ic-BL) can provide a key test to stellar explosion models. However, this requires large samples of the rare Ic-BL events with follow-up observations in the radio, where fast ejecta can be probed largely free of geometry and viewing angle effects.</description>

      <description>First author: Carys Herbert
We present measurements of spot properties on 31 young stellar objects, based on multi-band data from the HOYS (Hunting Outbursting Young Stars) project. On average the analysis for each object is based on 270 data points during 80 days in at least 3 bands. All the young low-mass stars in our sample show periodic photometric variations. We determine spot temperatures and coverage by comparing the measured photometric amplitudes in optical bands with simulated amplitudes based on atmosphere models, including a complete error propagation.</description>

High-redshift observations are often biased towards massive and bright galaxies that are not necessarily representative of the full population. In order to accurately study galaxy evolution and mass assembly at these redshifts, observations of normal&#39;&#39; main sequence galaxies are required. Here we present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) 0.3&amp;quot; resolution observations of the [CII] emission line at 158$\mu$m of HZ7, a main sequence galaxy at $z=5.</description>

The warm-hot intergalactic medium (warm-hot IGM, or WHIM) pervades the filaments of the Cosmic Web and harbours half of the Universe&amp;rsquo;s baryons. The WHIM&amp;rsquo;s thermodynamic properties are notoriously hard to measure. Here we estimate a galaxy group - WHIM boundary temperature using a new method. In particular, we use a radio image of the giant radio galaxy (giant RG, or GRG) created by NGC 6185, a massive nearby spiral.</description>

Quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals are discovered in some fast radio bursts (FRBs) such as FRB 20191221A, as well as in the X-ray burst associated with the galactic FRB from SGR 1935+2154. We revisit the intermediate-field FRB model where the radio waves are generated as fast-magnetosonic waves through magnetic reconnection near the light cylinder. The current sheet in the magnetar wind is compressed by a low frequency pulse emitted from the inner magnetosphere to trigger magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <description>First author: Katalin Oláh
Although late-type dwarfs and giant stars are substantially different, their flares are thought to originate in similar physical processes and differ only by a scale factor in the energy levels. We study the validity of this approach. We search for characteristics of flares on active giants, which might be statistically different from those on main-sequence stars. We used nearly 4000 flares of 61 giants and 20 stars of other types that were observed with Kepler in long-cadence mode, which is the only suitable database for this comparative study.</description>

The cluster mass-richness relation (MRR) is an observationally efficient and potentially powerful cosmological tool for constraining the mean matter density of the universe and the amplitude of fluctuations using the cluster abundance technique. We derive the MRR relation using GalWCat19, a publicly available galaxy cluster catalog we created from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-DR13 spectroscopic dataset. The MRR shows a tail at the low-richness end.</description>

      <description>First author: Zhiwei Chen
A significant number of stellar binary black hole (sBBH) mergers may be lensed and detected by the third generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors. Their lensed host galaxies may be detectable, which thus helps to accurately localize these sources and provide a new approach to study the origin of sBBHs. In this paper, we investigate the detectability of the lensed host galaxies for the lensed sBBH mergers.</description>

This paper systematically studies the relation between metallicity and mass loss of massive stars. We perform one-dimensional stellar evolution simulations and build a grid of $\sim$2000 models with initial masses ranging between 11 and 60 $M_{\odot}$ and absolute metallicities $Z$ between 0.00001 and 0.02. Steady-state winds, comprising hot main-sequence winds and cool supergiant winds, are the main drivers of the mass loss of massive stars in our models.</description>

We present a data-driven technique to analyze multi-frequency images from upcoming cosmological surveys mapping large sky area. Using full information from the data at the two-point level, our method can simultaneously constrain the large-scale structure (LSS), the spectra and redshift distribution of emitting sources, and the noise in observed data without any prior assumptions beyond the homogeneity and isotropy of cosmological perturbations. In particular, the method does not rely on source detection or photometric or spectroscopic redshift estimates.</description>

Using data from the Galactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array Continuum Transit Survey (GALFACTS), we report the discovery of two previously unidentified, very compressed, thin, and straight polarized filaments approximately centred at Galactic coordinates, $(l,b)=(182.5^\circ,-4.0^\circ)$, which we call G182.5&amp;ndash;4.0. Using data from the Isaac Newton Telescope Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS), we also find straight, long, and extremely thin H$\alpha$ filaments coincident with the radio emission. These filaments are positioned in projection at the edge of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble and we find evidence indicating that the filaments align with the coherent magnetic field of the outer Galaxy.</description>

Recent studies have revealed a strong relation between sample-averaged black-hole (BH) accretion rate (BHAR) and star formation rate (SFR) among bulge-dominated galaxies, i.e., &amp;ldquo;lockstep&amp;rdquo; BH-bulge growth, in the distant universe. This relation might be closely related to the BH-bulge mass correlation observed in the local universe. To understand further BH-bulge coevolution, we present ALMA CO(2-1) or CO(3-2) observations of 7 star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies at z=0.5-2.5. Using the ALMA data, we detect significant ($&amp;gt;3\sigma$) CO emission from 4 objects.</description>

Dust extinction is one of the most reliable tracers of the gas distribution in the Milky Way. The near-infrared (NIR) Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey enables extinction mapping based on stellar photometry over a large area in the Galactic plane. We devise a novel extinction mapping approach, XPNICER, by bringing together VVV photometric catalogs, stellar parameter data from StarHorse catalogs, and previously published Xpercentile and PNICER extinction mapping techniques.</description>

Recent high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with a variety of codes systematically predict large amounts of entropy in the intra-cluster medium at low redshift, leading to flat entropy profiles and a suppressed cool-core population. This prediction is at odds with X-ray observations of groups and clusters. We use a new implementation of the EAGLE galaxy formation model to investigate the sensitivity of the central entropy and the shape of the profiles to changes in the sub-grid model applied to a suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations of a group of mass $M_{500} = 8.</description>

3D simulations of high mass young stellar object (HMYSO) growth show that their circumstellar discs fragment onto multiple self-gravitating objects. Accretion of these by HMYSO may explain episodic accretion bursts discovered recently. We post-process results of a previous 3D simulation of a HMYSO disc with a 1D code that resolves the disc and object dynamics down to the stellar surface. We find that burst-like deposition of material into the inner disc seen in 3D simulations by itself does not always signify powerful accretion bursts.</description>

More and more experiments have identified that the energy spectra of both primary and secondary cosmic-rays exhibit a hardening above $\sim 200$ GV. Most recently, the DAMPE experiment has reported a hardening of boron-to-carbon ratio at $200$ GV. These signs call for modifications of the conventional cosmic-ray (CR) picture. In this work, we propose that the plethoric secondary cosmic rays, for example, boron, antiprotons, originate from the hadronic interactions of freshly accelerated cosmic rays with the interstellar gas near the sources.</description>

Many core collapse supernovae (SNe) with hydrogen-poor and low-mass ejecta, such as ultra-stripped SNe and type Ibn SNe, are observed to interact with dense circumstellar material (CSM). These events likely arise from the core-collapse of helium stars which have been heavily stripped by a binary companion and ejected significant mass during the last weeks to years of their lives. In helium star models run to days before core-collapse, we identify a range of helium core masses $\approx 2.</description>

The race for the most distant object in the Universe has been played by long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), star-forming galaxies and quasars. GRBs took a temporary lead with the discovery of GRB 090423 at a redshift z=8.2, but now the record-holder is the galaxy GN-z11 at z=11.0. Despite this record, galaxies and quasars are very faint (GN-z11 has a magnitude H=26), hampering the study of the physical properties of the primordial Universe.</description>

We present ALMA band 6 observations of the luminous blue variable Eta Car, obtained within the ALMAGAL program. We report SiO J=5-4, SiS J=12-11 and SiN N=5-4 emission in the equatorial region of the Homunculus nebula, constituting the first detection of silicon- and sulphur-bearing molecules in the outskirts of a highly evolved, early-type massive star. SiO, SiS and SiN trace a clumpy equatorial ring that surrounds the central binary at a projected distance of 2 arcsec, delineating the inner rims of the butterfly-shaped dusty region.</description>

Extremely red quasars, with bolometric luminosities exceeding $10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$, are a fascinating high-redshift population that is absent in the local universe. They are the best candidates for supermassive black holes accreting at rates at or above the Eddington limit, and they are associated with the most rapid and powerful outflows of ionized gas known to date. They are also hosted by massive galaxies. Here we present the first integral field unit (IFU) observations of a high-redshift quasar obtained by the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which targeted SDSSJ165202.</description>

Gamma-ray flares of blazars may be accompanied by high-energy neutrinos due to interactions of high-energy cosmic rays in the jet with photons, as suggested by the detection of the high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A during a major gamma-ray flare from blazar TXS 0506+056 at the $\sim3\sigma$ significance level. In this work, we present a statistical study of gamma-ray emission from blazars to constrain the contribution of gamma-ray flares to their neutrino output.</description>

      <description>First author: Rui Xue
In the study of radiation mechanisms of AGNs&amp;rsquo; jets, hadronuclear (pp) interactions are commonly neglected, because the number density of cold protons in the jet is considered insufficient. Very recently, our previous work proves that pp interactions in the low TeV luminosity AGNs, which have potential to generate detectable very-high-energy (VHE) emission, could be important. Based on this, the one-zone pp model is employed to study low-state quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions of a sample of low TeV luminosity AGNs in this work.</description>

With the most trans-iron elements detected of any star outside the Solar System, HD 222925 represents the most complete chemical inventory among r-process-enhanced, metal-poor stars. While the abundance pattern of the heaviest elements identified in HD 222925 agrees with the scaled Solar r-process residuals, as is characteristic of its r-process-enhanced classification, the newly measured lighter r-process elements display marked differences from their Solar counterparts. In this work, we explore which single astrophysical site (if any) produced the entire range of elements ($34\leq Z\leq 90$) present in HD 222925.</description>

      <description>First author: Meredith Neyer
We study the impact of neutral hydrogen absorption on ${\rm H_2}$ photodissociation in protogalactic haloes exposed to soft-UV radiation. Lyman-series absorption can significantly deplete dissociating photons as line overlap with the ${\rm H_2}$ Lyman-Werner bands occurs for neutral column densities exceeding $10^{22}$ ${\rm cm^{-2}}$, but this effect has not been previously included in studies of protogalactic haloes. We use high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate this &amp;ldquo;HI-shielding&amp;rdquo; in three metal-free atomic cooling haloes collapsing at redshift $z \sim 10-20$.</description>

We present a detailed analysis of the ionised gas distribution and kinematics in the inner ~ 200 pc of NGC 4546, host of a Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus (LLAGN). Using GMOS-IFU observations, with a spectral coverage of 4736-6806 A and an angular resolution of 0.7 arcsec, we confirm that the nuclear emission is consistent with photoionisation by an AGN, while the gas in the circumnuclear region may be ionised by hot low-mass evolved stars.</description>

Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) are possible candidates for explaining the observed magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. Two competing scenarios of primordial magnetogenesis have been discussed in the literature: inflationary and phase-transitional. We study the amplification of both large- and small-scale correlated magnetic fields corresponding to inflation- and phase-transition-generated PMFs in a massive galaxy cluster. We employ high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations to resolve turbulent motions in the intracluster medium.</description>

      <description>First author: Stefano Garcia
Context. Gamma Doradus (hereafter $\gamma$~Dor) stars are gravity-mode pulsators whose periods carry information about the internal structure of the star. These periods are especially sensitive to the internal rotation and chemical mixing, two processes that are currently not well constrained in the theory of stellar evolution. Aims. We aim to identify the pulsation modes and deduce the internal rotation and buoyancy travel time for 106 $\gamma$ Dor stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission in its southern continuous viewing zone (hereafter S-CVZ).</description>

The first Pop III stars formed out of primordial, metal free gas, in minihalos at z&amp;gt;20, and kickstarted the cosmic processes of reionizaton and enrichment. While these stars are likely more massive than their enriched counterparts, the current unknowns of their astrophysics include; when the first Pop III stars ignited, how massive they were, and when and how the era of the first stars ended.</description>

Throughout the passage within the Galactic halo, high-velocity clouds (HVCs) sweep up ambient magnetic fields and form stretched and draped configurations of magnetic fields around them. This magnetized layer at the cloud-halo interface can suppress the mixing between the cloud and the surrounding halo gas. For simplicity, many earlier numerical studies adopt spherically symmetric uniform-density clouds as initial conditions. However, observations of HVCs indicate that the clouds are clumpy and turbulent.</description>

Geometry and dynamical structure of emission regions in accreting pulsars are shaped by the interplay between gravity, radiation, and strong magnetic field, which significantly affects the opacities of a plasma and radiative pressure under such extreme conditions. Quantitative consideration of magnetic plasma opacities is, therefore, an essential ingredient of any self-consistent modeling of emission region structure of X-ray pulsars. We present results of computations of the Rosseland and Planck mean opacities of a strongly magnetized plasma with a simple chemical composition,namely the solar hydrogen/helium mix.</description>

Turbulent plasma motion is common in the universe, and invoked in solar flares to drive effective acceleration leading to high energy electrons. Unresolved mass motions are frequently detected in flares from extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations, which are often regarded as turbulence. However, how this plasma turbulence forms during the flare is still largely a mystery. Here we successfully reproduce observed turbulence in our 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation where the magnetic reconnection process is included.</description>

Standard sirens &amp;ndash; gravitational wave (GW) sources with an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart &amp;ndash; can be used to measure the Hubble constant directly which should help to ease the existing Hubble tension. However, if the source is moving, a relativistic redshift affects the redshift of the EM counterpart and the apparent distance of the GW source, and thus it needs to be corrected to obtain accurate measurements.</description>

      <description>First author: Nicholas Kaaz
The angular momentum of gas feeding a black hole (BH) is typically misaligned with respect to the BH spin, resulting in a tilted accretion disk. Rotation of the BH drags the surrounding space-time, manifesting as Lense-Thirring torques that lead to disk precession and warping. We study these processes by simulating a thin ($H/r=0.02$), highly tilted ($\mathcal{T}=65^\circ$) accretion disk around a rapidly rotating ($a=0.9375$) BH at extremely high resolutions, which we performed using the general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code H-AMR.</description>

We explore two generic hypotheses for tracing the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in the Universe: star formation rate density or stellar mass density. For each scenario, we infer a set of constraints for the emission mechanisms in the accelerators, for their energetics and for the abundances of elements at escape from their environments. From these constraints, we generate sky maps above 40~EeV expected from a catalog that comprises 410,761 galaxies out to 350 Mpc and provides a near-infrared flux-limited sample to map both stellar mass and star formation rate over the full sky.</description>

A tantalizing enigma in extragalactic astronomy concerns the chronology and driving mechanisms of the build-up of late-type galaxies (LTGs). The standard scenario envisages two formation routes, with classical bulges (CBs) assembling first in a quick quasi-monolithic episode followed by gradual disk assembly, and pseudo-bulges (PBs) forming over the Gyr-long secular evolution of LTGs. The expectation is, therefore, the segregation of present-day LTG bulges into two distinct groups.</description>

Through the analysis of Wilson-Devinney (W-D) program, KN Per was found as an A-type low mass ratio deep contact binary (q=0.236, f=53.4%). A cool spot applied on the primary component was introduced to explain the unequal maxima of the light curve.</description>

The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) remains a poorly understood cosmic era for the most part. Yet, efforts are still going on to probe and understand this epoch. We present a review of the latest developments in the techniques (especially line-intensity mapping) to study the EoR and try to highlight the contribution of the Indian community in this field. Line-emissions like [H I]${\rm 21cm}$, Lyman-$\alpha$, [C II]${\text{158}\mu\text{m}}$ and their role as tracers in probing the EoR are discussed.</description>

Pulsars are rotating neutron stars that emit periodic electromagnetic radiation. While pulsars generally slow down as they lose energy, some also experience glitches: spontaneous increases of their rotational frequency. According to several models, these glitches can also lead to the emission of long-duration transient gravitational waves (GWs). We present detection prospects for such signals by comparing indirect energy upper limits on GW strain for known glitches with the sensitivity of current and future ground-based GW detectors.</description>

In many black hole systems, the accretion disk is expected to be misaligned with respect to the black hole spin axis. If the scale height of the disk is much smaller than the misalignment angle, the spin of the black hole can tear the disk into multiple, independently precessing `sub-disks&amp;rsquo;. This is most likely to happen during outbursts in black hole X-Ray binaries (BHXRBs) and in active galactic nuclei (AGN) accreting above a few percent of the Eddington limit, because the disk becomes razor-thin.</description>

      <description>First author: Konstantinos Kritos
Gravitational-wave observations have just started probing the properties of black-hole binary merger populations. The observation of binaries with very massive black holes and small mass ratios motivates the study of dense star clusters as astrophysical environments which can produce such events dynamically. In this paper we present Rapster (for &amp;ldquo;Rapid cluster evolution&amp;rdquo;), a new code designed to rapidly model binary black hole population synthesis and the evolution of star clusters based on simple, yet realistic prescriptions.</description>

      <description>First author: Alister W. Graham
We recently revealed that bulges and elliptical galaxies broadly define distinct, super-linear relations in the $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm *,sph}$ diagram, with the order-of-magnitude lower $M_{\rm bh}/M_{\rm *,sph}$ ratios in the elliptical galaxies due to major (disc-destroying, elliptical-building) dry mergers. Building on this, here we present a more nuanced picture. Galaxy mergers, in which the net orbital angular momentum does not cancel, can lead to systems with a rotating disc.</description>

      <description>First author: Weiqiang Yang
In this paper we consider the effects of adding curvature in extended cosmologies involving a free-to-vary neutrino sector and different parametrizations of Dark Energy (DE). We make use of the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization data, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Pantheon type Ia Supernovae data. Our main result is that a non-flat Universe cannot be discarded in light of the current astronomical data, because we find an indication for a closed Universe in most of the DE cosmologies explored in this work.</description>

      <description>First author: James Sunseri
We present a new $\texttt{python}$ package SARABANDE for measuring 3 &amp;amp; 4 Point Correlation Functions (3/4 PCFs) in $\mathcal{O}(N_{\rm g} \log N_{\rm g})$ time using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), with $N_{\rm g}$ the number of grid points used for the FFT. SARABANDE can measure both projected and full 3 and 4 PCFs on gridded 2D and 3D datasets. The general technique is to generate suitable angular basis functions on an underlying grid, radially bin these to create kernels, and convolve these kernels with the original gridded data to obtain expansion coefficients about every point simultaneously.</description>

We continue our exploration of the wiggly generalisation of the Velocity-Dependent One Scale Model for cosmic strings, through the study of its allowed asymptotic scaling solutions. We extend the work of a previous paper [Almeida $&amp;amp;$ Martins, Phys. Rev. D 104 (2021) 043524] by considering the more comprehensive case of a time-varying coarse-graining scale for the string wiggles. The modeling of the evolution of the network therefore relies on three main mechanisms: Hubble expansion, energy transfer mechanisms (e.</description>

We present a search for continuous gravitational wave signals from an unidentified pulsar potentially powering HESS J1427-608, a spatially-unresolved TeV point source detected by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S). The search uses a semi-coherent algorithm, which combines the maximum likelihood $\mathcal{F}-$statistic with a hidden Markov Model to efficiently detect and track quasi-monochromatic signals that wander randomly in frequency. It uses data from the second observing run of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.</description>

Dark matter could comprise, at least in part, primordial black holes (PBH). To test this hypothesis, we present an approach to constrain the PBH mass ($M_{\rm{PBH}}$) and mass fraction ($f_{\rm{PBH}}$) from the flux ratios of quadruply imaged quasars. Our approach uses an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) forward modeling technique to directly sample the posterior distribution of $M_{\rm{PBH}}$ and $f_{\rm{PBH}}$, while marginalizing over the subhalo mass function amplitude, spatial distribution, and the size of the lensed source.</description>

The atmosphere is one of the most important contamination sources in the ground-based Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. In this paper, we study three kinds of filters, which are polynomial filter, high-pass filter, and Wiener filter, to investigate their ability for removing atmospheric noise, as well as their impact on the data analysis process through the end-to-end simulations of CMB experiment. We track their performance by analyzing the response of different components of the data, including both signals and noise.</description>

The extreme space weather conditions resulting from high energetic events likes solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) demand for reliable space weather forecasting. The magnetic flux tubes while rising through the convection zone gets twisted by the turbulent plasma flows, energizing the system and resulting in flares. We investigate the relationship between the subsurface plasma flows associated with flaring active regions and their surface magnetic flux and current helicity.</description>

Studies of solar twins have key impacts on the astronomical community, but only $\sim$100&amp;ndash;200 nearby solar twins ($&amp;lt;$ 1 kpc) have been reliably identified over the last few decades. The aim of our survey (SDST) is to identify $\sim$150&amp;ndash;200 distant solar twins and analogues (up to $\lesssim$ 4 kpc) closer to the Galactic Centre. We took advantage of the precise Gaia and Skymapper surveys to select Sun-like candidates in a 2-degree field, which were observed with the HERMES spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope.</description>

We find deficits in the mean emission line flux of [O III] and H$\alpha$ (65 and 43%, respectively) along the polar vs.</description>

With a spatial resolution of 23 mas and a sensitivity of 15 $\rm \mu Jy~beam^{-1}$, we detect a total of 38 protostellar disks.

Fast cosmological transients such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) represent a class of sources more compact than any other cosmological object. As such they are sensitive to significant magnification via gravitational lensing from a class of lenses which are not well-constrained by observations today. Low-mass primordial black holes are one such candidate which may constitute a significant fraction of the Universe&amp;rsquo;s dark matter.</description>

Approximate methods to populate dark matter halos with galaxies are of great utility to large galaxy surveys. However, the limitations of simple halo occupation models (HODs) preclude a full use of small-scale galaxy clustering data and call for more sophisticated models. We study two galaxy populations, luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and star-forming emission-line galaxies (ELGs), at two epochs, $z=1$ and $z=0$, in the large volume, high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation of the MillenniumTNG project.</description>

We then build an emulator capable of reproducing the projected galaxy correlation function at the monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole level for separations between $0.</description>

The early release science results from the $\textit{James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)}$ have yielded an unexpected abundance of high-redshift luminous galaxies that seems to be in tension with current theories of galaxy formation. However, it is currently difficult to draw definitive conclusions form these results as the sources have not yet been spectroscopically confirmed. It is in any case important to establish baseline predictions from current state-of-the-art galaxy formation models that can be compared and contrasted with these new measurements.</description>

Modern redshift surveys are tasked with mapping out the galaxy distribution over enormous distance scales. Existing hydrodynamical simulations, however, do not reach the volumes needed to match upcoming surveys. We present results for the clustering of galaxies using a new, large volume hydrodynamical simulation as part of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project. With a computational volume that is $\approx15$ times larger than the next largest such simulation currently available, we show that MTNG is able to accurately reproduce the observed clustering of galaxies as a function of stellar mass.</description>

We use the EAGLE cosmological simulations to study the evolution of the vertical velocity dispersion of cold gas, $\sigma_{z}$, in central disc galaxies and its connection to stellar feedback, gravitational instabilities, cosmological gas accretion and galaxy mergers. To isolate the impact of feedback, we analyse runs that turn off stellar and (or) AGN feedback in addition to a run that includes both. The evolution of $\sigma_z$ and its dependence on stellar mass and star formation rate in EAGLE are in good agreement with observations.</description>

      <description>First author: Kijeong Yim
We observe the almost edge-on (i $\sim$ 90 degrees) galaxy NGC 4302 using ALMA (CO) and VLA (H I) to measure the gas disk thickness for investigating the volumetric star formation law (SFL). The recent star formation rate (SFR) is estimated based on a linear combination of IR 24 micron and H$\alpha$ emissions. The measured scale heights of CO and H I increase significantly with radius.</description>

      <description>First author: Jin-Hong Chen
During the inspiralling of a white dwarf (WD) into an intermediate-mass black hole (~10^{2-5} M_sun), both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation are emitted. Once the eccentric orbit&amp;rsquo;s pericenter radius approaches the tidal radius, the WD would be tidally stripped upon each pericenter passage. The accretion of these stripped mass would produce EM radiation. It is suspected that the recently discovered new types of transients, namely the quasi-periodic eruptions and the fast ultraluminous X-ray bursts, might originate from such systems.</description>

      <description>First author: Yang Jiang
Parity violation is expected to generate an asymmetry between the amplitude of left and right-handed gravitational-wave modes which leads to a circularly polarized stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). Due to the three independent baselines in the LIGO-Virgo network, we focus on the amplitude difference in strain power characterized by Stokes&amp;rsquo; parameters and do maximum-likelihood estimation to constrain the polarization degree of SGWB. Our results indicate that there is no evidence for the circularly polarized SGWB in the data.</description>

      <description>First author: Raul Jimenez
Evidence for almost spatial flatness of the Universe has been provided from several observational probes, including the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from galaxy clustering data. However, other than inflation, and in this case only in the limit of infinite time, there is no strong a priori motivation for a spatially flat Universe. Using the renormalization group (RG) technique in curved spacetime, we present in this work a theoretical motivation for spatial flatness.</description>

The long-term cyclicity and temporal succession of glacial-periglacial (or deglacial) periods or epochs are keynotes of Quaternary geology on Earth. Relatively recent work has begun to explore the histories of the mid- to higher-latitudinal terrain of Mars, especially in the northern hemisphere, for evidence of similar cyclicity and succession in the Mid to Late Amazonian Epoch. Here, we carry on with this work by focusing on Protonilus Mensae [PM] (43-490 N, 37-590 E).</description>

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has provided photometric light curves for stars across nearly the entire sky. This allows for the application of asteroseismology to a pool of potential solar-like oscillators that is unprecedented in size. We aim to produce a catalogue of solar-like oscillators observed by TESS in the 120-second and 20-second cadence modes. The catalogue is intended to highlight stars oscillating at frequencies above the TESS 30-minute cadence Nyquist frequency with the purpose of encompassing the main sequence and subgiant evolutionary phases.</description>

Recent ALMA large surveys unveiled the presence of significant dust continuum emission in star-forming galaxies at $z&amp;gt;4$. Unfortunately, such large programs &amp;ndash; i.e. ALPINE ($z\sim 5$) and REBELS ($z \sim 7$) &amp;ndash; only provide us with a single Far-Infrared (FIR) continuum data point for their individual targets. Therefore, high-$z$ galaxies FIR spectral energy densities (SEDs) remain mostly unconstrained, hinging on an assumption for their dust temperature ($T_{\rm d}$) in the SED fitting procedure.</description>

SS433 is a Galactic microquasar with powerful outflows (double jet, accretion disk and winds) with well known orbital, precessional and nutational period. In this work we characterise different outflow parameters throughout the precessional cycle of the system. We analyse 10 NuSTAR ($3-70$ keV) observations of $\sim$30~ks that span $\sim$1.5 precessional cycles. We extract averaged spectra and model them using a combination of a double thermal jet model (bjet) and pure neutral and relativistic reflection (xillverCp and relxilllpCp) over an accretion disk.</description>

      <description>First author: E. Karamehmetoglu
If high-mass stars (&amp;gt;20-25 Msun) are the progenitors of stripped-envelope (SE) supernovae (SNe), their massive ejecta should lead to broad, long-duration lightcurves (LCs). Instead, literature samples of SE~SNe have reported relatively narrow LCs with ejecta masses between 1-4 Msun that favor progenitors &amp;lt;20-25 Msun. Working with the untargeted sample of (i)PTF SNe to better constrain their rates, we search for SE~SNe with broad LCs. Using a simple LC stretch compared to a template to measure broadness, we identified eight significantly broader Type~Ibc SNe after applying quantitative sample selection criteria.</description>

The High Resolution Imager (HRI_EUV) telescope of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument onboard Solar Orbiter has observed EUV brightenings, so-called campfires, as fine-scale structures at coronal temperatures. The goal of this paper is to compare the basic geometrical (size, orientation) and physical (intensity, lifetime) properties of the EUV brightenings with regions of energy dissipation in a non-potential coronal magnetic field simulation. In the simulation, HMI line-of-sight magnetograms are used as input to drive the evolution of solar coronal magnetic fields and energy dissipation.</description>

Wide, deep, blind continuum surveys at submillimetre/millimetre (submm/mm) wavelengths are required to provide a full inventory of the dusty, distant Universe. However, conducting such surveys to the necessary depth, with sub-arcsec angular resolution, is prohibitively time-consuming, even for the most advanced submm/mm telescopes. Here, we report the most recent results from the ALMACAL project, which exploits the &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; calibration data from the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) to map the lines of sight towards and beyond the ALMA calibrators.</description>

More specifically, we focus on galaxies that infall isotropically from those that are infalling alongside filaments. We use a sample of galaxies obtained from the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation SAG applied to the MultiDark simulation.</description>

Hot Jupiters are the most studied and easily detectable exoplanets for transit observations.However, the correlation between the atmospheric flow and the emission spectra of such planets is still not understood. Due to huge day-night temperature contrast in hot Jupiter, the thermal redistribution through atmospheric circulation has a significant impact on the vertical temperature-pressure structure and on the emission spectra. In the present work, we aim to study the variation of the temperature-pressure profiles and the emission spectra of such planets due to different amounts of atmospheric heat redistribution.</description>

The spectra obtained with NuSTAR, Chandra, XMM-Newton and Swift/BAT are simultaneously analyzed by separating the contributions from the two AGNs and extended emission with the Chandra data. To evaluate the reflection components from the AGN tori, we consider two models, a phenomenological one (pexrav and zgauss) and a more physically motivated one (XCLUMPY; Tanimoto et al.</description>

Population III stars were the first stars to form after the Big Bang, and are believed to have made the earliest contribution to the metal content of the universe beyond the products of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. These stars are theorized to have had extremely short lifespans, and therefore would only be observable at high redshifts ($z \geq 3-17$) and faint apparent magnitudes ($m_{AB} \gtrsim 40$).</description>

We conduct a $^{12}$C$^{16}$O($J$=1-0) (hereafter CO) mapping survey of 64 galaxies in the Fornax cluster using the ALMA Morita array in cycle 5. CO emission is detected from 23 out of the 64 galaxies. Our sample includes dwarf, spiral and elliptical galaxies with stellar masses of $M_{\rm star}\sim10^{6.3-11.6}$~M$\odot$. The achieved beam size and sensitivity are $15&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;\times8&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;$ and $\sim12$~mJy~beam$^{-1}$ at the velocity resolution of $\sim10$~km~s$^{-1}$, respectively.

The distribution of molecules between the gas and solid phase during star and planet formation, determines the trajectory of gas and grain surface chemistry, as well as the delivery of elements to nascent planets. This distribution is primarily set by the binding energies of different molecules to water ice surfaces. We computationally estimated the binding energies of ten astrochemically relevant P-bearing species on water surface, we also validate our method for 20 species with known binding energies.</description>

At the ultra-high densities existing in the core of neutron stars, it is expected that a phase transition from baryonic to deconfined quark matter may occur. Such a phase transition would affect the underlying equation of state (EoS) as well as the observable astrophysical properties of neutron stars. Comparison of EoS model predictions with astronomical data from multi-messenger signals then provides us an opportunity to probe the behaviour of dense matter.</description>

The first critical fast Mach number is defined for a magnetohydrodynamic shock as the Mach number where the shock transitions from subcritical, laminar, behavior to supercritical behavior, characterized by incident ion reflection from the shock front. The ensuing upstream waves and turbulence are convected downstream leading to a turbulent shock structure. Formally this is the Mach number where plasma resistivity can no longer provide sufficient dissipation to establish a stable shock, and is characterized by the downstream flow speed becoming subsonic.</description>

      <description>First author: DAMPE Collaboration
Boron nuclei in cosmic rays (CRs) are believed to be mainly produced by the fragmentation of heavier nuclei, such as carbon and oxygen, via collisions with the interstellar matter. Therefore, the boron-to-carbon flux ratio (B/C) and the boron-to-oxygen flux ratio (B/O) are very essential probes of the CR propagation. The energy dependence of the B/C ratio from previous balloon-borne and space-based experiments can be well described by a single power-law up to about 1 TeV/n within uncertainties.</description>

LS I +61{\deg}303 is a high mass X-ray binary that is also catalogued as a gamma-ray binary as a result of frequent outbursts at TeV photon energies. The system has released two soft-gamma flares in the past, suggesting a magnetar interpretation for the compact primary. This inference has recently gained significant traction following the discovery of transient radio pulses, detected in some orbital phases from the system, as the measured rotation and tentative spindown rates imply a polar magnetic field strength of $B_p \gtrsim 10^{14},\mbox{G}$ if the star is decelerating via magnetic dipole braking.</description>

      <description>First author: V. V. Pipin
We model the physical parameters of Solar Cycles 23 and 24 using a nonlinear dynamical mean-field dynamo model that includes the formation and evolution of bipolar magnetic regions (BMR). The Parker-type dynamo model consists of a complete MHD system in the mean-field formulation: the 3D magnetic induction equation, and 2D momentum and energy equations in the anelastic approximation. The initialization of BMR is modeled in the framework of Parker&amp;rsquo;s magnetic buoyancy instability.</description>

Planets can carve gaps in the surface density of protoplanetary discs. The formation of these gaps can reduce the corotation torques acting on the planets. In addition, gaps can halt the accretion of solids onto the planets as dust and pebbles can be trapped at the edge of the gap. This accumulation of dust could explain the origin of the ring-like dust structures observed using high-resolution interferometry.</description>

      <description>First author: P. Beniamini
Two recent discoveries, namely PSR J0901-4046 and GLEAM-X J162759.5-523504.3 (hereafter GLEAM-X J1627), have corroborated an extant population of radio-loud periodic sources with long periods (76 s and 1091 s respectively) whose emission can hardly be explained by rotation losses. We argue that GLEAM-X J1627 is a highly-magnetized object consistent with a magnetar (an ultra long period magnetar - ULPM), and demonstrate it is unlikely to be either a magnetically or a rotationally-powered white dwarf.</description>

We obtained ultraviolet and optical spectra for 9 M~dwarfs across a range of rotation periods to determine whether they showed stochastic intrinsic variability distinguishable from flares. The ultraviolet spectra were observed during the Far Ultraviolet M~Dwarf Evolution Survey \emph{Hubble~Space~Telescope} program using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. The optical observations were taken from the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-meter telescope using the Dual Imaging Spectrograph and from the Gemini South Observatory using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph.</description>

      <description>First author: P. Kamphuis
Galaxies in the local Universe are thought to require ongoing replenishment of their gas reservoir in order to maintain the observed star formation rates. Cosmological simulations predict that such accretion can occur in both a dynamically hot and cold mode. However, until now observational evidence of the accretion required to match the observed star formation histories is lacking. This paper attempts to determine whether galaxies in the local Universe possess a significant reservoir of HI and what would be the accretion rates derived from such reservoirs.</description>

      <description>First author: William Giarè
The Data Release 4 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) shows an agreement with an Harrison-Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich primordial spectrum ($n_s=1.009 \pm 0.015$), introducing a tension with a significance of $99.3%$ CL with the results from the Planck satellite. The discrepancy on the value of the scalar spectral index is neither alleviated with the addition of large scale structure information nor with the low multipole polarization data. We discuss possible avenues to alleviate the tension relying on either neglecting polarization measurements from ACT or in extending the inflationary sector of the theory.</description>

Neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) insensitive relations or universal relations (UR) involving neutron star bulk properties play a crucial role in gravitational-wave astronomy. Considering a wide range of equations of state originating from (i) phenomenological relativistic mean field models, (ii) realistic EoS models based on different physical motivations, and (iii) polytropic EoSs described by spectral decomposition method, we update the EoS-insensitive relations involving NS tidal deformability (Multipole Love relation) and the UR between f-mode frequency and tidal deformability (f-Love relation).</description>

      <description>First author: Didam Duniya
f(R) gravity is one of the simplest viable modifications to General Relativity: it passes local astrophysical tests, predicts both the early-time cosmic inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration, and also describes dark matter. In this paper, we probe cosmic magnification on large scales in f (R) gravity, using the well-known Hu-Sawicki model as an example. Our results indicate that at redshifts z &amp;lt; 3, values of the model exponent n &amp;gt; 1 lead to inconsistent behaviour in the evolution of scalar perturbations.</description>

We examine in greater detail five events previously identified as being sources of strong transient coronal outflows in a solar polar region in Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) Doppler data. Although relatively compact or faint and inconspicuous in Hinode/Soft X-ray Telescope (XRT) soft-X-ray (SXR) images and in Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) EUV images, we find that all of these events are consistent with being faint coronal X-ray jets.</description>

      <description>First author: Noriaki Kitazawa
In the realistic model of cosmic inflation the inflaton potential should be flat and stable under quantum corrections. It is natural to imagine that there is some symmetry behind and an idea of the inflaton as a Nambu-Goldstone boson of spontaneous breaking of some symmetry has been examined. We give a general formulation of this idea using the non-linear realization of Nambu-Goldstone boson in low-energy effective theory with some explicit symmetry breaking to generate non-trivial potential.</description>

T Tauri stars are low-mass pre-main sequence stars that are intrinsically variable. Due to the intense magnetic fields they possess, they develop dark spots on their surface that, because of rotation, introduce a periodic variation of brightness.In addition, the presence of surrounding disks could generate flux variations by variable extinction or accretion. Both can lead to a brightness decrease or increase, respectively. Here, we have compiled a catalog of light curves for 379 T Tauri stars in the Lagoon Nebula (M8) region, using VVVX survey data in the Ks-band.</description>

Precise measurements of the boron-to-carbon and boron-to-oxygen ratios by DAMPE show clear hardenings around $100$ GeV/n, which provide important implications on the production, propagation, and interaction of Galactic cosmic rays. In this work we investigate a number of models proposed in literature in light of the DAMPE findings. These models can roughly be classified into two classes, the propagation effect and the source effect. Among these models discussed, we find that the re-acceleration of cosmic rays during their propagation by random magnetohydrodynamic waves may not reproduce significant enough hardenings of B/C and B/O, and an additional spectral break of the diffusion coefficient is required.</description>

The Sun shows a wide range of temporal variations, from a few seconds to decades and even centuries, broadly classified into two classes short-term and Long-term. The solar dynamo mechanism is believed to be responsible for these global changes happening in the Sun. Hence, many dynamo models have been proposed to explain the observed behaviour of the Sun. This thesis is primarily focused on studying the \lt\ variation of the Sun and provides various inputs to the solar dynamo models.</description>

Strong gravitational lensing is a unique observational tool for studying the dark and luminous mass distribution both within and between galaxies. Given the presence of substructures, current strong lensing observations demand more complex mass models than smooth analytical profiles, such as power-law ellipsoids. In this work, we introduce a continuous neural field to predict the lensing potential at any position throughout the image plane, allowing for a nearly model-independent description of the lensing mass.</description>

Recent astrophysical transient Swift J1913.1+1946 is possibly associated with the gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A at the redshift z=0.151. The transient was accompanied by very high-energy gamma rays up to 18 TeV observed by LHAASO and a photon-like air shower of 251 TeV detected by Carpet-2. These energetic gamma rays cannot reach us from the claimed distance of the source because of the pair production on cosmic background radiation.</description>

Dark deposits visible from orbit appear in the Martian south polar region during the springtime. These are thought to form from explosive jets of carbon dioxide gas breaking through the thawing seasonal ice cap, carrying dust and dirt which is then deposited onto the ice as dark &amp;lsquo;blotches&amp;rsquo;, or blown by the surface winds into streaks or &amp;lsquo;fans&amp;rsquo;. We investigate machine learning (ML) methods for automatically identifying these seasonal features in High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) satellite imagery.</description>

Theory predicts that the temperature of the X-ray-emitting gas ($\sim$10$^{6}$ K) detected from planetary nebulae (PNe) is a consequence of mixing or thermal conduction when in contact with the ionized outer rim ($\sim$10$^{4}$ K). Gas at intermediate temperatures ($\sim$10$^{5}$ K) can be used to study the physics of the production of X-ray-emitting gas, via C IV, N V and O VI ions. Here we model the stellar atmosphere of the CSPN of NGC 1501 to demonstrate that even this hot H-deficient [WO4]-type star cannot produce these emission lines by photoionization.</description>

A key goal of the Solar Orbiter mission is to connect elemental abundance measurements of the solar wind enveloping the spacecraft with EUV spectroscopic observations of their solar sources, but this is not an easy exercise. Observations from previous missions have revealed a highly complex picture of spatial and temporal variations of elemental abundances in the solar corona. We have used coordinated observations from Hinode and Solar Orbiter to attempt new abundance measurements with the SPICE (Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment) instrument, and benchmark them against standard analyses from EIS (EUV Imaging Spectrometer).</description>

The most significant feature in the cosmic-ray (CR) nuclei spectra is the spectral hardening at a few hundred GV. Whether the hardening of the different nuclei species are same or not is important for constructing CR source and propagation models. In this work, we collect the latest released AMS-02 CR nuclei spectra of primary species (proton, helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, and iron), secondary species (lithium, beryllium, boron, and fluorine), and hybrid species (nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum), and study the break positions and the spectral index differences (less and greater than the break rigidity) of the spectral hardening quantitatively.</description>

Nonlinear effects are crucial for the propagation of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) near the source. We study the filamentation of FRBs in the relativistic winds of magnetars, which are commonly invoked as the most natural FRB progenitors. As a result of filamentation, the particle number density and the radiation intensity develop strong gradients along the direction of the wind magnetic field. A steady state is reached when the plasma pressure balances the ponderomotive force.</description>

Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have been recognized as an important future probe of the early Universe. Existing theoretical studies primarily focused on describing the evolution and creation of average distortions, ignoring spatial perturbations in the plasma. One of the main reasons for this choice is that a treatment of the spectro-spatial evolution of the photon field deep into the primordial Universe requires solving a radiative transfer problem for the distortion signals, which in full detail is computationally challenging.</description>

The long-term dynamical evolution is a crucial point in recent planetary research. Although the amount of observational data is continuously growing and the precision allows us to obtain accurate planetary orbits, the canonical stability analysis still requires N-body simulations and phase space trajectory investigations. We propose a method for stability analysis of planetary motion based on the generalized R&#39;enyi entropy obtained from a scalar measurement. The radial velocity data of the central body in the gravitational three-body problem is used as the basis of a phase space reconstruction procedure.</description>

      <description>First author: Lindsey Byrne
Several recent simulations of galaxy formation predict two main phases of supermassive black hole (BH) accretion: an early, highly intermittent phase (during which BHs are under-massive relative to local scaling relations), followed by a phase of accelerated growth. We investigate physical factors that drive the transition in BH accretion in cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE project, ranging from dwarf galaxies to galaxies sufficiently massive to host luminous quasars.</description>

      <description>First author: Kuan-Chou Hou
Galaxy clusters accrete mass through large scale, strong, structure-formation shocks. Such a virial shock is thought to deposit fractions $\xi_e$ and $\xi_B$ of the thermal energy in cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) and magnetic fields, respectively, thus generating a leptonic virial ring. However, the expected synchrotron signal was not convincingly established until now. We stack low-frequency radio data from the OVRO-LWA around the 44 most massive, high latitude, extended MCXC clusters, enhancing the ring sensitivity by rescaling clusters to their characteristic, $R_{500}$ radii.</description>

Based on their differing radio morphologies, powerful radio galaxies can be separated into the Fanaroff-Riley I (FR-I) and II (FR-II) classes. Hybrid morphology radio sources (HyMoRS) contain morphologies consistent with each type of jet on either side: a powerful, highly relativistic FR-II-like jet terminating in a hotspot on one side and an FRI-like plume on the other. HyMoRS present a unique opportunity to study the conditions which give rise to the dichotomy.</description>

Venus clouds host a convective layer between roughly 50 and 60 km that mixes heat, momentum, and chemical species. Observations and numerical modelling have helped to understand the complexity of this region. However, the impact on chemistry is still not known. Here, we use for the first time a three-dimensional convection-resolving model with passive tracers to mimic SO$_2$ and H$_2$O for two latitudinal cases. The tracers are relaxed towards a vertical profile in agreement with measured values, with a timescale varying over several orders of magnitude.</description>

We report on the changing-look nature of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the galaxy NGC 4156, as serendipitously discovered thanks to data acquired in 2019 at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) during a students&amp;rsquo; observing programme. Previous optical spectra had never shown any signatures of broad-line emission, and evidence of the AGN had come only from X-ray observations, being the optical narrow-line flux ratios unable to unambiguously denote this galaxy as a Seyfert.</description>

The Canadian Hydrogen Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a radio telescope located in British Columbia, Canada. The large field of view (FOV) of $\sim$ 200 square degrees has enabled the CHIME/FRB instrument to produce the largest FRB catalog to date. The large FOV also allows CHIME/FRB to be an exceptional pulsar and Rotating Radio Transient (RRAT) finding machine, despite saving only the metadata information of incoming Galactic events.</description>

We present the Spectroscopic Classification of Astronomical Transients (SCAT) survey, which is dedicated to spectrophotometric observations of transient objects such as supernovae and tidal disruption events. SCAT uses the SuperNova Integral-Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) on the University of Hawai&amp;rsquo;i 2.2-meter (UH2.2m) telescope. SNIFS was designed specifically for accurate transient spectrophotometry, including absolute flux calibration and host-galaxy removal. We describe the data reduction and calibration pipeline including spectral extraction, telluric correction, atmospheric characterization, nightly photometricity, and spectrophotometric precision.</description>

We present observations of the historic transient 4U 1730-22 as observed with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). After remaining in quiescence since its 1972 discovery, this X-ray binary showed renewed outburst activity in 2021 and 2022. We observed 4U 1730-22 extensively with NICER, detecting a total of 17 thermonuclear X-ray bursts. From a spectroscopic analysis, we find that these X-ray bursts can be divided into a group of bright and weak bursts.</description>

We predict the 21-cm global signal and power spectra during the Epoch of Reionisation using the MERAXES semi-analytic galaxy formation and reionisation model, updated to include X-ray heating and thermal evolution of the intergalactic medium. Studying the formation and evolution of galaxies together with the reionisation of cosmic hydrogen using semi-analytic models (such as MERAXES) requires N-body simulations within large volumes and high mass resolutions. For this, we use a simulation of side-length $210$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc with $4320^3$ particles resolving dark matter haloes to masses of $5\times10^8$ $h^{-1}$ $M_\odot$.</description>

The titanium abundances of late-type stars are important tracers of Galactic formation history. However, abundances inferred from Ti I and Ti II lines can be in stark disagreement in very metal-poor giants. Departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) have a large impact on the minority neutral species and thus influences the ionisation imbalance, but satisfactory non-LTE modelling for both dwarfs and giants has not been achieved in previous literature.</description>

Convergent disk migration has long been suspected to be responsible for forming planetary systems with a chain of mean-motion resonances (MMR). Dynamical evolution over time could disrupt the delicate resonant configuration. We present TOI-1136, a 700-Myr-old G star hosting at least 6 transiting planets between $\sim$2 and 5 $R_\oplus$. The orbital period ratios deviate from exact commensurability by only $10^{-4}$, smaller than the $\sim$,$10^{-2}$ deviations seen in typical Kepler near-resonant systems.</description>

The current architecture of a given multi-planetary system is a key fingerprint of its past formation and dynamical evolution history. Long-term follow-up observations are key to complete their picture. In this paper we focus on the confirmation and characterization of the components of the TOI-969 planetary system, where TESS detected a Neptune-size planet candidate in a very close-in orbit around a late K-dwarf star. We use a set of precise radial velocity observations from HARPS, PFS and CORALIE instruments covering more than two years in combination with the TESS photometric light curve and other ground-based follow-up observations to confirm and characterize the components of this planetary system.</description>

We use the SPHINX$^{20}$ cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation to study how Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons escape from galaxies and the observational signatures of this escape. We define two classes of LyC leaker: Bursty Leakers and Remnant Leakers, based on their star formation rates (SFRs) that are averaged over 10 Myr (SFR${10}$) or 100 Myr (SFR${100}$). Both have $f_{\rm esc}&amp;gt;20%$ and experienced an extreme burst of star formation, but Bursty Leakers have ${\rm SFR_{10}&amp;gt;SFR_{100}}$, while Remnant Leakers have ${\rm SFR_{10}&amp;lt;SFR_{100}}$.</description>

The statistical power of weak lensing measurements is principally driven by the number of high redshift galaxies whose shapes are resolved. Conventional wisdom and physical intuition suggest this is optimised by deep imaging at long (red or near IR) wavelengths, to avoid losing redshifted Balmer break and Lyman break galaxies. We use the synthetic Emission Line EL-COSMOS catalogue to simulate lensing observations using different filters, from various altitudes.</description>

Ultracompact cataclysmic variables (CVs) of the AM CVn type are deemed to be important verification sources for the future space gravitational wave detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We model the present-day Galactic population of AM CVn stars with He-star donors. Such a population has long expected to exist, though only a couple of candidates are known. We applied the hybrid method of binary population synthesis (BPS) which combines a simulation of the population of immediate precursors of AM CVn stars by a fast BPS code with subsequent tracking of their evolution by a full evolutionary code.</description>

In comparison to the previous version AESOPUS 1.0, we updated and expanded molecular absorption to include 80 species, mostly using the recommended line lists currently available from the ExoMol and HITRAN databases. Furthermore, in light of a recent study, we revised the H- photodetachment cross section, added the free-free absorption of other negative ions of atoms and molecules, and updated the collision-induced absorption due to H2/H2, H2/H, H2/He, and H/He pairs.</description>

We cross-correlate positions of galaxies measured in data from the first three years of the Dark Energy Survey with Compton-$y$-maps generated using data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the {\it Planck} mission. We model this cross-correlation measurement together with the galaxy auto-correlation to constrain the distribution of gas in the Universe. We measure the hydrostatic mass bias or, equivalently, the mean halo bias-weighted electron pressure $\langle b_{h}P_{e}\rangle$, using large-scale information.</description>

      <description>First author: Chris Nagele
The origin of high-redshift quasars and their supermassive black hole engines is unclear. One promising solution is the collapse of a primordial supermassive star. Observational confirmation of this scenario may be difficult, but a general relativistic instability supernova provides one avenue for such. Previous studies have found that a general relativistic instability supernova has a potentially decades-long plateau phase visible to JWST at high redshift. In this work, we examine stars with mass just below the general relativistic instability supernova mass range.</description>

Cosmic string networks form during cosmological phase transitions as a consequence of the Kibble mechanism. The evolution of the simplest networks is accurately described by the canonical Velocity Dependent One-Scale (VOS) model. However, numerical simulations have demonstrated the existence of significant quantities of short-wavelength propagation modes on the strings, known as wiggles, which motivated the recent development of a wiggly string extension of the VOS.</description>

      <description>First author: Shuo Xiao
The precursors of short and long Gamma Ray Bursts (SGRBs and LGRBs) can serve as probes of their progenitors, as well as shedding light on the physical processes of mergers or core-collapse supernovae. Some models predict the possible existence of Quasi-Periodically Oscillations (QPO) in the precursors of SGRBs. Although many previous studies have performed QPO search in the main emission of SGRBs and LGRBs, so far there was no systematic QPO search in their precursors.</description>

Built in 2004, the Skynet robotic telescope network originally consisted of six 0.4 m telescopes located at the Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory in the Chilean Andes. The network was designed to carry out simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) when they are only tens of seconds old. To date, the network has been expanded to ~20 telescopes, including a 20 m radio telescope, that span four continents and five countries.</description>

We report the identification of a set of old super metal-rich dwarf stars with orbits of low eccentricity that reach a maximum height from the Galactic plane between ~0.5-1.5 kpc. We discuss their properties to understand their origins. We use data from the internal data release 6 of the Gaia-ESO Survey. We selected stars observed at high resolution with abundances of 21 species of 18 individual elements.</description>

Transmission spectroscopy is a prime technique to study the chemical composition and structure of exoplanetary atmospheres. Strong excess absorption signals have been detected in the optical Na I D1, 2 Fraunhofer lines during transits of hot Jupiters, which are attributed to the planetary atmospheres and allow us to constrain its structure. We study the atmosphere of WASP-7 b by means of high-resolution transit spectroscopy in the sodium lines.</description>

Transiting exoplanets orbiting young nearby stars are ideal laboratories for testing theories of planet formation and evolution. However, to date only a handful of stars with age &amp;lt;1 Gyr have been found to host transiting exoplanets. Here we present the discovery and validation of a sub-Neptune around HD 18599, a young (300 Myr), nearby (d=40 pc) K star. We validate the transiting planet candidate as a bona fide planet using data from the TESS, Spitzer, and Gaia missions, ground-based photometry from IRSF, LCO, PEST, and NGTS, speckle imaging from Gemini, and spectroscopy from CHIRON, NRES, FEROS, and Minerva-Australis.</description>

We implement a multi-group and discrete-ordinate neutrino transport model in spherical symmetry which allows to simulate collective neutrino oscillations by including realistic collisional rates in a self-consistent way. We utilize this innovative model, based on strategic parameter rescaling, to study a recently proposed collisional flavor instability caused by the asymmetry of emission and absorption rates between $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$ for four different static backgrounds taken from different stages in a core-collapse supernova simulation.</description>

The accurate ALMA positions allowed unambiguous identifications of their NIRCam counterparts. Taking gravitational lensing into account, these represent 16 distinct galaxies in three fields and constitute the largest sample of its kind to date. The counterparts&amp;rsquo; spectral energy distributions from rest-frame ultraviolet to near infrared provide photometric redshifts ($1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4.</description>

The use of the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model for gravitational-wave data analysis is investigated. The AST machine-learning model is a convolution-free classifier that captures long-range global dependencies through a purely attention-based mechanism. In this paper a model is applied to a simulated dataset of inspiral gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star coalescences, built from five distinct, cold equations of state (EOS) of nuclear matter.</description>

      <description>First author: Daniel A. Berke
The rich absorption spectra of Sun-like stars are enticing probes for variations in the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, which gauges the strength of electromagnetism. While individual line wavelengths are sensitive to $\alpha$, they are also sensitive to physical processes in the stellar atmospheres, which has precluded their use so far. Here we demonstrate a new, differential approach using solar twins: velocity separations between close pairs of transitions are compared across stars with very similar physical properties, strongly suppressing astrophysical and instrumental systematic errors.</description>

      <description>First author: Daniel A. Berke
Sun-like stars are a new probe of variations in the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, via the solar twins approach: velocity separations of close pairs of absorption lines are compared between stars with very similar stellar parameters, i.e. effective temperature, metallicity and surface gravity within 100K, 0.1 dex and 0.2 dex of the Sun&amp;rsquo;s values. Here we assess possible systematic errors in this approach by analysing $\gtrsim$10,000 archival exposures from the High-Accuracy Radial velocity Planetary Searcher (HARPS) of 130 stars covering a much broader range of stellar parameters.</description>

We constrain the intrinsic Eddington ratio (\lamEdd ) distribution function for local AGN in bins of low and high obscuration (log NH &amp;lt;= 22 and 22 &amp;lt; log NH &amp;lt; 25), using the Swift-BAT 70-month/BASS DR2 survey. We interpret the fraction of obscured AGN in terms of circum-nuclear geometry and temporal evolution. Specifically, at low Eddington ratios (log lamEdd &amp;lt; -2), obscured AGN outnumber unobscured ones by a factor of ~4, reflecting the covering factor of the circum-nuclear material (0.</description>

Using the IRAM-NOEMA interferometer in the highest resolution A-configuration, we resolve the source into two components separated by $\sim$8 kpc, visible as blue shifted and red shifted $^{12}$CO(5-4) lines, exhibiting the expected kinematic properties of a major merger between two gas-rich galaxies.</description>

Gaia HyperVelocity Star (HVS) kinematic observations favor a local escape velocity of ~700 km/s, nearly forty-percent greater than conventional estimates. Combining HVS and dwarf galaxy satellite data reveal the global escape velocity profile for the Galaxy smoothly traces an unbroken Keplerian decline from the central bar to the most remote satellite galaxy. We reveal a robust upper bound in baryonic mass discrepancy (maximal relative accelerations) linked to the virial theorem and obtain a fundamental and universal mass discrepancy-acceleration relation for virialized compact cosmic objects.</description>

Aims: Our aim is to provide an observational view of the old Disk structure of the Milky Way galaxy using the distribution of red clump stars. The spiral arms, warp structure, and other asymmetries present in the Disk are re-visited using a systematic study of red clump star counts over the disk of the Galaxy. Methods: We developed a method to systematically extract the red clump stars from 2MASS ($J-K_s, ~J$) colour-magnitude diagram of $1^\circ \times 1^\circ$ bins in $\ell \times b$ covering the range $40^\circ \le \ell \le 320^\circ$ and $-10^\circ \le b \le 10^\circ$.</description>

These data measure protostellar flux densities on envelope scales $\le$ 8000 AU (20&amp;quot;) and resolve the structure of envelopes with 1600 AU (4&amp;quot;) resolution, a factor of 3-5 improvement in angular resolution over existing single dish 870 $\mu$m observations.

To exploit various photometric databases, we develop a method of empirically calibrating synthetic stellar spectra based on a comparison with observations of stellar sequences and individual stars in SDSS, SMSS, and PS1, overcoming band-specific corrections employed in our previous work.</description>

Very little is known about the young planet population because the detection of small planets orbiting young stars is obscured by the effects of stellar activity and fast rotation which mask planets within radial velocity and transit data sets. The few planets that have been discovered in young clusters generally orbit stars too faint for any detailed follow-up analysis. Here we present the characterization of a new mini-Neptune planet orbiting the bright (V=9) and nearby K2 dwarf star, HD 18599.</description>

The infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) of star-forming galaxies can be used to estimate their star formation rate (SFR) based on the radio continuum luminosity at MHz-GHz frequencies. For application in future deep radio surveys, it is crucial to know whether the IRRC persists at high redshift z. Delvecchio et al. (2021) observed that the 1.4 GHz IRRC correlation of star-forming galaxies is nearly z-invariant up to z~4, but depends strongly on the stellar mass M_star.</description>

These observations resolve a network of core-connecting dust lanes, marking a departure from earlier coarser more spherical continuum structures. At the same time, the cores do not appear to fragment further. Polarized dust emission is clearly detected.</description>

Type Ia supernovae are thought to be carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars that explode after accreting material from a companion star, but despite extensive studies the nature of the companion star is still poorly understood, as is the explosion mechanism. In the single degenerate scenario, the companion is a non-degenerate star that loses material through winds and/or binary interaction, and a few Type Ia supernovae have shown evidence for hydrogen-rich circumstellar material.</description>

Recently, extra motivation has been given to the investigations of an unresolved problem of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) produced by the recycling process, as an apparent role of the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) in white dwarfs (WDs) was suggested to this concern. I have found that the distribution of the orbital periods of binary MSPs in the Galactic disk closely follows an exponential distribution. I have also determined the best-fit mean value of Nobs by fitting our data with an exponential distribution for the MSP population.</description>

      <description>First author: Takashi Hamana
An excess up-scattering mass bias on weak lensing cluster mass estimate is a statistical bias that an observed weak lensing mass ($M_{\rm obs}$) of a cluster of galaxies is, in a statistical sense, larger than its true mass ($M_{\rm true}$) because of a higher chance of up-scattering than that of down-scattering due to random noises in a weak lensing cluster shear profile. This non-symmetric scattering probability is caused by a monotonically decreasing cluster mass function with increasing mass.</description>

      <description>First author: Satoshi Inoue
We present a newly developed data-driven magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation code under a zero-beta approximation based on a method proposed by Hayashi et al. 2018 and 2019. Although many data-driven MHD simulations have been developed and conducted, there are not many studies on how accurately those simulations can reproduce the phenomena observed in the solar corona. In this study, we investigated the performance of our data-driven simulation quantitatively using ground-truth data.</description>

      <description>First author: BICEP/Keck Collaboration
We present estimates of line-of-sight distortion fields derived from the 95 GHz and 150 GHz data taken by BICEP2, BICEP3, and Keck Array up to the 2018 observing season, leading to cosmological constraints and a study of instrumental and astrophysical systematics. Cosmological constraints are derived from three of the distortion fields concerning gravitational lensing from large-scale structure, polarization rotation from magnetic fields or an axion-like field, and the screening effect of patchy reionization.</description>

Galactic winds play a key role in regulating the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time. In recent years, the role of cosmic rays (CR) in the formation of the galactic wind has increasingly gained attention. Therefore, we use radio continuum data to analyse the cosmic ray transport in edge-on galaxies. Data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data release 2 at 144 MHz (HBA) and reprocessed VLA data at 1.</description>

We present a chemodynamical analysis of 11,562 metal-rich, high-eccentricity halo-like main-sequence (MS) stars, which has been referred to as the Splash or Splashed Disk, selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). When divided into two groups, a low-[$\alpha$/Fe] population (LAP) and a high-[$\alpha$/Fe] population (HAP), based on kinematics and chemistry, we find that they exhibit very distinct properties, indicative of different origins.</description>

Between 2014 December 31 and 2015 March 17, the OSIRIS cameras on Rosetta documented the growth of a 140m wide and 0.5m deep depression in the Hapi region on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. This shallow pit is one of several that later formed elsewhere on the comet, all in smooth terrain that primarily is the result of airfall of coma particles. We have compiled observations of this region in Hapi by the microwave instrument MIRO on Rosetta, acquired during October and November 2014.</description>

The diversity of dynamical conditions among exoplanets is now well established. Yet, the relevance of orbital dynamical timescales to biological evolutionary timescales is poorly understood. Given that even minor orbital changes may place significant pressure on any organisms living on a planet, dynamical sculpting has important implications for the putative evolution of life. In this manuscript, we employ a Monte Carlo framework to investigate how a range of exoplanetary dynamical sculpting timescales affects timescales for biological evolution.</description>

We perform weak lensing tomographic peak studies using the first-year shear data from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) survey. The effective area used in our analyses after field selection, mask and boundary exclusions is $\sim 58 \deg^2$. The source galaxies are divided into low- and high-redshift bins with $0.2\le z_p\le0.85$ and $0.85\le z_p\le1.5$, respectively. We utilize our halo-based theoretical peak model including the projection effect of large-scale structures to derive cosmological constraints from the observed tomographic high peak abundances with the signal-to-noise ratio in the range of $\nu_{\rm N}=[3.</description>

For years, earth-based neutrino detectors have been run and operated to detect the elusive neutrino. These have historically been enormous underground detectors. The neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory ($\nu$SOL) project is working to design a technical demonstration to show that a much smaller neutrino detector can be operated in near-solar environments for a future spaceflight mission. At a closest approach of 3 solar radii, there is a ten thousand-fold increase in the neutrino flux.</description>

We report the discovery of one possible neutron star binary ($P_{\rm orb} =$ 0.8666 day) by using the LAMOST low-resolution spectroscopic data. The visible companion is a late A-type dwarf ($T_{\rm eff} = 7900 \pm 200$ K; log$g$ $=$ 4.3$\pm$0.2; $M =$ 1.7$\pm$0.1 M${\odot}$; $R\ =\ 1.7\pm0.2$ R${\odot}$), at a distance of 1.11$\pm0.03$ kpc. No double-lined feature can be seen from the GTC/HORuS high-resolution spectra, thus the radial velocity variation indicates an invisible object hiding in the binary.</description>

We evolve two high-resolution general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of advection-dominated accretion flows around non-spinning black holes (BHs), each over a duration $\sim 3\times 10^5,GM_{\rm BH}/c^3$. One model captures the evolution of a weakly magnetized (SANE) disk and the other a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). Magnetic flux eruptions in the MAD model push out gas from the disk and launch strong winds with outflow efficiencies at times reaching $10%$ of the incoming accretion power.</description>

We present the first high-resolution zoom-in simulation of a Milky-way-like halo extracted from the Aquarius Project in the Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) framework. We use the N-body code AX-GADGET, based on a particle oriented solution of the Schr&amp;quot;{o}dinger-Poisson equations, able to detail the complexity of structure formation while keeping track of the quantum effects in FDM. The halo shows a cored density profile, with a core size of several kpc for a FDM mass of $m_{\chi}=2.</description>

Relativistic jets originating from protomagnetar central engines can lead to long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and are considered potential sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays and secondary neutrinos. We explore the propagation of such jets through a broad range of progenitors, from stars which have shed their envelopes to supergiants which have not. We use a semi-analytical spindown model for the strongly magnetised and rapidly rotating PNS to investigate the role of central engine properties such as the surface dipole field strength, initial rotation period, and jet opening angle on the interactions and dynamical evolution of the jet-cocoon system.</description>

The single-degenerate (SD) model is one of the leading models for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Recently, a new version of the SD model, the common-envelope wind (CEW) model, has been proposed, which, in principle, has the potential to resolve most of the difficulties encountered by previous SD models. This model is still being developed and a number of open issues remain, such as the details of the mass-loss mechanism from the surface of the common envelope (CE), the main observational properties, and the spiral-in timescale of the binary inside the envelope.</description>

      <description>First author: Cora Uhlemann
One-point probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the cosmic matter density are powerful cosmological probes that extract non-Gaussian properties of the matter distribution and complement two-point statistics. Computing the covariance of one-point PDFs is key for building a robust galaxy survey analysis for upcoming surveys like Euclid and the Rubin Observatory LSST and requires good models for the two-point PDFs characterising spatial correlations. In this work, we obtain accurate PDF covariances using effective shifted lognormal two-point PDF models for the mildly non-Gaussian weak lensing convergence and validate our predictions against large sets of Gaussian and non-Gaussian maps.</description>

The nonresonant streaming instability (Bell instability) plays a pivotal role in the acceleration and confinement of cosmic rays (CRs); yet, the exact mechanism responsible for its saturation and the magnitude of the final amplified magnetic field have not been assessed from first-principles. Using a survey of hybrid simulations (with kinetic ions and fluid electrons), we study the evolution of the Bell instability as a function of the parameters of the CR population.</description>

The solar activity displays variability and periodic behaviours over a wide range of timescales, with the presence of a most prominent cycle with a mean length of 11 years. Such variability is transported within the heliosphere by solar wind, radiation and other processes, affecting the properties of the interplanetary medium. The presence of solar activity-related periodicities is well visible in different solar wind and geomagnetic indices, although with time lags with respect to the solar one, leading to hysteresis cycles.</description>

The total amount of dust grains in protoplanetary disks is one of the key properties that characterize the potential for planet formation. With (sub-)millimeter flux measurements, literature studies usually derive the dust mass using an analytic form under the assumption of optically thin emission, which may lead to substantial underestimation. In this work, we conduct a parameter study with the goal of investigating the effects of disk structure and dust properties on the underestimation through self-consistent radiative transfer models.</description>

The standard perturbation theory (SPT) approach to gravitational clustering is based on a fluid approximation of the underlying Vlasov-Poisson dynamics, taking only the zeroth and first cumulant of the phase-space distribution function into account (density and velocity fields). This assumption breaks down when dark matter particle orbits cross and leads to well-known problems, e.g. an anomalously large backreaction of small-scale modes onto larger scales that compromises predictivity.</description>

      <description>First author: Mathias Garny
We present non-linear solutions of Vlasov Perturbation Theory (VPT), describing gravitational clustering of collisionless dark matter with dispersion and higher cumulants induced by orbit crossing. We show that VPT can be cast into a form that is formally analogous to standard perturbation theory (SPT), but including additional perturbation variables, non-linear interactions, and a more complex propagation. VPT non-linear kernels have a crucial decoupling property: for fixed total momentum, the kernels becomes strongly suppressed when any of the individual momenta cross the dispersion scale into the non-linear regime.</description>

Polar dust has been found to play an important role in the mid-infrared emission of nearby Seyfert nuclei. If and how often polar dust exists among the quasar population is unknown due to the lack of spatially-resolved observations. In this Letter, we report correlations between the prominence of AGN forbidden line emission (commonly associated with the narrow line region) and the dust mid-IR energy output among the archetypal Palomar-Green quasar sample and other bright type-1 AGNs drawn from the SDSS, Spitzer and WISE archives.</description>

      <description>First author: Wenbin Lu
We propose that the recently observed quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) in galactic nuclei are produced by unstable mass transfer due to Roche lobe overflow of a low-mass (&amp;lt; 0.5Msun) main-sequence star in a mildly eccentric (e ~ 0.5) orbit. We argue that the QPE emission is powered by circularization shocks, but not directly by black hole accretion. Our model predicts the presence of a time-steady accretion disk that is bolometrically brighter than the time-averaged QPE luminosity, but primarily emits in the extreme-UV.</description>

      <description>First author: Ruth A. Daly
The rotational properties of astrophysical black holes are fundamental quantities that characterization the black holes. A new method to empirically determine the spin mass-energy characteristics of astrophysical black holes is presented and applied here. Results are obtained for a sample of 100 supermassive black holes with collimated dual outflows and redshifts between about zero and two. An analysis indicates that about two-thirds of the black holes are maximally spinning, while one-third have a broad distribution of spin values; it is shown that the same distributions describe the quantity $\rm{(M_{rot}/M_{irr})}$.</description>

The polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be used to search for parity-violating processes like that predicted by a Chern-Simons coupling to a light pseudoscalar field. Such an interaction rotates $E$ modes into $B$ modes in the observed CMB signal by an effect known as cosmic birefringence. Even though isotropic birefringence can be confused with the rotation produced by a miscalibration of the detectors&amp;rsquo; polarization angles the degeneracy between both effects is broken when Galactic foreground emission is used as a calibrator.</description>

Feedback from massive stars shapes the ISM and affects the evolution of galaxies, but its mechanisms acting at the small scales ($\sim 10$ pc) are still not well constrained observationally, especially in the low-metallicity environments. We present the analysis of the ionized gas (focusing on its kinematics, which were never studied before), and its connection to the massive stars in the nearby ($D \sim 1.</description>

Neustadt &amp;amp; Kochanek (2022, hereafter NK22) proposed a new method to reconstruct the temperature perturbation map (as functions of time and disc radius) of AGN accretion discs using multi-wavelength photometric light curves. We apply their technique to 100 quasars at $z=0.5-2$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping project, using multi-epoch spectroscopy that covers rest-frame UV-optical continuum emission from the quasar and probes days to months timescales.</description>

We compare stellar mass surface density, metallicity, age, and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles in massive ($M_\geq10^{10.5},\mathrm{M_\odot}$) present-day early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the MaNGA survey with simulated galaxies from the TNG100 simulation of the IllustrisTNG suite. We find an excellent agreement between the stellar mass surface density profiles of MaNGA and TNG100 ETGs, both in shape and normalisation. Moreover, TNG100 reproduces the shapes of the profiles of stellar metallicity and age, as well as the normalisation of velocity dispersion distributions of MaNGA ETGs.</description>

The observations cover the spectral range 3100-10400 \A with a spectral resolution of $\Delta\lambda\ge\lambda/11600$, and we measure 95-225 emission lines in each object.</description>

Ly$\alpha$ emission extending over $\gtrsim,\rm 10,kiloparsec,(kpc)$ around dusty, massive starbursts at $z\gtrsim3$ might represent a short-lived phase in the evolution of present-day, massive quiescent galaxies. To obtain empirical constraints on this emerging scenario, we present Ly$\alpha$, CIV, and HeII observations taken with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer towards J1000$+$0234: a galaxy pair at $z=4.5$ composed of a low-mass starburst (J1000$+$0234$-$South) neighboring a massive Submillimeter Galaxy (SMG; J1000$+$0234$-$North) that harbors a rotationally supported gas disk.</description>

      <description>First author: Matthew E. Quenneville
We present wide-field, deep $K$-band photometry of 98 luminous early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the MASSIVE survey based on observations taken with the WIRCam instrument on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Using these images, we extract accurate total $K$-band luminosities ($L_K$) and half-light radii ($R_e$) for this sample of galaxies. We use these new values to explore the size-luminosity and Faber-Jackson relations for massive ETGs. Within this volume-limited sample, we find clear evidence for curvature in both relations, indicating that the most luminous galaxies tend to have larger sizes and smaller velocity dispersions than expected from a simple power-law fit to less luminous galaxies.</description>

We study close encounters of a $1,M_{\odot}$ middle-age main-sequence star (modelled using MESA) with massive black holes through hydrodynamic simulations, and explore in particular the dependence of the outcomes on the black hole mass. We consider here black holes in the intermediate-mass range, $M_{\rm BH}= 100-10^4,M_{\odot}$. Possible outcomes vary from a small tidal perturbation for weak encounters all the way to partial or full disruption for stronger encounters.</description>

Transiting planets around young stars are key benchmarks for our understanding of planetary systems. One of such candidates was identified around the K dwarf HD 18599 by TESS, labeled as TOI-179. We present the confirmation of the transiting planet and the characterization of the host star and of the TOI-179 system over a broad range of angular separations. To this aim, we exploited the TESS photometric time series, intensive radial velocity monitoring performed with HARPS, and deep high-contrast imaging observations obtained with SPHERE and NACO at VLT.</description>

We perform a rigorous cosmology analysis on simulated type Ia supernovae (SN~Ia) and evaluate the improvement from including photometric host-galaxy redshifts compared to using only the &amp;ldquo;zspec&amp;rdquo; subset with spectroscopic redshifts from the host or SN. We use the Deep Drilling Fields (~50 deg^2) from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (PLaSTiCC), in combination with a low-z sample based on Data Challenge2 (DC2). The analysis includes light curve fitting to standardize the SN brightness, a high-statistics simulation to obtain a bias-corrected Hubble diagram, a statistical+systematics covariance matrix including calibration and photo-z uncertainties, and cosmology fitting with a prior from the cosmic microwave background.</description>

Several recent studies have shown that velocity differences of very wide binary stars, measured to high precision with GAIA, can potentially provide an interesting test for modified-gravity theories which attempt to emulate dark matter; in essence, MOND-like theories (with external field effect included) predict that wide binaries (wider than $\sim 7$ kAU) should orbit $\sim 15%$ faster than Newtonian for similar orbit parameters; such a shift is readily detectable in principle in the sample of 9,000 candidate systems selected from GAIA EDR3 by Pittordis and Sutherland (2022).</description>

3XMM J185246.6+003317 is a slowly rotating soft-gamma repeater (neutron star) in the vicinity of the supernova remnant Kes,79. So far, observations have only set upper limits to its surface magnetic field and spindown, and there is no estimate for its mass and radius. Using ray-tracing modelling and Bayesian inference for the analysis of several light curves spanning a period of around three weeks, we have found that it may be one of the most massive neutron stars to date.</description>

We generalize the combinatorial algebraic approach first proposed by Dhurandhar et al. to construct various classes of modified second-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) solutions. The main idea behind the algorithm is to enumerate, in a given order, a specific type of commutator between two monomials defined by the products of particular time-displacement operators. On the one hand, the above commutators can be systematically rewritten as the elements of a left ideal, defined by the l.</description>

In spite of the spectacular progress accomplished by stellar evolution theory some simple questions remain unanswered. One of these questions is ``Why do stars become Red Giants?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;. Here we present a relatively simple analytical answer to this question. We validate our analysis by constructing a quantitative toy-model of a red giant and comparing its predictions to full stellar evolutionar models. We find that the envelope forces the value of $\nabla=d \ln T/d \ln P$ at, and above, the burning shell into a very narrow range of possible values.</description>

Taking advantage of such a wide-volume survey, we perform a pilot study using early HETDEX data to search for lensed Lyman-alpha emitters.

      <description>First author: Matteo Braglia
Future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments will deliver extremely accurate measurements of the E-modes pattern of the CMB polarization field. Given the sharpness of the E-modes transfer functions, such surveys make for a powerful detector of high-frequency signals from primordial features that may be lurking in current data sets. With a handful of toy models that increase the fit to the latest Planck data, but are of marginal statistical significance, we use a state-of-the-art forecast pipeline to illustrate the promising prospects to test primordial features in the next decade.</description>

      <description>First author: Daniel C. M Palumbo
The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has produced images of two supermassive black holes, Messier~87* (M 87*) and Sagittarius~A* (Sgr A*). The EHT collaboration used these images to indirectly constrain black hole parameters by calibrating measurements of the sky-plane emission morphology to images of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Here, we develop a model for directly constraining the black hole mass, spin, and inclination through signatures of lensing, redshift, and frame dragging, while simultaneously marginalizing over the unknown accretion and emission properties.</description>

We analyse the full shape of anisotropic clustering measurements from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic survey (eBOSS) quasar sample together with the combined galaxy sample from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We obtain constraints on the cosmological parameters independent of the Hubble parameter $h$ for the extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM models, focusing on cosmologies with free dark energy equation of state parameter $w$. We combine the clustering constraints with those from the latest CMB data from Planck to obtain joint constraints for these cosmologies for $w$ and the additional extension parameters - its time evolution $w_{\rm{a}}$, the physical curvature density $\omega_{K}$ and the neutrino mass sum $\sum m_{\nu}$.</description>

We apply the color-magnitude intercept calibration method (CMAGIC) to the Nearby Supernova Factory SNe Ia spectrophotometric dataset. The currently existing CMAGIC parameters are the slope and intercept of a straight line fit to the first linear region in the color-magnitude diagram, which occurs over a span of approximately 30 days after maximum brightness. We define a new parameter, $\omega_{XY}$, the size of the ``bump&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; feature near maximum brightness for arbitrary filters $X$ and $Y$.</description>

      <description>First author: Chen Heinrich
The next-generation CMB experiments are expected to constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ with high precision. Delensing is an important process as the observed CMB $B$-mode polarization that contains the primordial tensor perturbation signal is dominated by a much larger contribution due to gravitational lensing. To do so successfully, it is useful to explore methods for lensing reconstruction beyond the traditional quadratic estimator (QE) (which will become suboptimal for the next-generation experiments), and the maximum a posterior estimator (which is still currently under development).</description>

We present an updated analysis of the first-order phase transition associated with symmetry breaking in the early Universe in a classically scale-invariant model extended with a new SU(2) gauge group. Including recent developments in understanding supercooled phase transitions, we compute all of its characteristics and significantly constrain the parameter space. We then predict gravitational wave spectra generated during this phase transition and by computing the signal-to-noise ratio we conclude that this model is well testable (and falsifiable) with LISA.</description>

The advent of ultra-precise photometry space missions enable the possibility of investigating stellar interior with mixed modes. The structural variations induced by the discontinuity of the chemical composition left behind during the first dredge&amp;ndash;up is an important feature in the stellar mid-layers located between the hydrogen-burning shell and the base of the convective zone of red giants, as the mixed-mode properties can be significantly affected by these variations.</description>

High-resolution spectroscopy studies of ultra-hot Jupiters have been key in our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres. Observing into the atmospheres of these giant planets allows for direct constraints on their atmospheric compositions and dynamics while laying the groundwork for new research regarding their formation and evolution environments. Two of the most well-studied ultra-hot Jupiters are WASP-76b and WASP-121b, with multiple detected chemical species and strong signatures of their atmospheric dynamics.</description>

In addition to a supermassive black hole (SMBH), the central parsec of the Milky Way hosts over a hundred of massive, high velocity young stars whose existence, and organisation of a subset of them in one, or possibly two, mis-aligned disks, is puzzling. Due to a combination of low medium density and strong tidal forces in the vicinity of Sgr A*, stars are not expected to form.</description>

Dust grains form in the clumpy ejecta of core-collapse supernovae where they are subject to the reverse shock, which is able to disrupt the clumps and destroy the grains. Important dust destruction processes include thermal and kinetic sputtering as well as fragmentation and grain vaporization. In the present study, we focus on the effect of magnetic fields on the destruction processes. We have performed magneto-hydrodynamical simulations using AstroBEAR to model a shock wave interacting with an ejecta clump.</description>

      <description>First author: Dustin D. Nguyen
The galactic wind model of Chevalier1985 (CC85) assumes $\textit{uniform}$ energy and mass-injection within the starburst galaxy nucleus. However, the structure of nuclear star clusters, bulges, and star-forming knots are inherently non-uniform. We generalize to cases with non-uniform energy/mass injection that scale as $r^{-\Delta}$ within the starburst volume $R$, providing solutions for $\Delta = 0$, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and 2. In marked contrast with the CC85 model ($\Delta=0$), which predicts zero velocity at the center, for a singular isothermal sphere profile ($\Delta=2$), we find that the flow maintains a $\textit{constant}$ Mach number of $\mathcal{M}=\sqrt{3/5} \simeq 0.</description>

The galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA) is a dominant source of systematics in weak lensing (WL) studies. In this paper, by employing large simulations with semi-analytical galaxy formation, we investigate the IA effects on WL peak statistics. Different simulated source galaxy samples of different redshift distributions are constructed, where both WL shear and IA signals are included. Convergence reconstruction and peak statistics are then performed for these samples.</description>

The Hubble horizon at matter-radiation equality ($k^{-1}{\rm{eq}}$) and the sound horizon at the last scattering surface ($r_s(z*)$) provides interesting consistency check for the $\Lambda$CDM model and its extensions. It is well known that the reduction of $r_s$ can be compensated by the increase of $H_0$, while the same is true for the standard rulers $k_{\rm{eq}}$. Adding extra radiational component to the early universe can reduce $k_{\rm{eq}}$.</description>

Solar evolutionary models are thus far unable to reproduce spectroscopic, helioseismic, and neutrino constraints consistently, resulting in the so-called solar modeling problem. In parallel, planet formation models predict that the evolving composition of the protosolar disk and, thus, of the gas accreted by the proto-Sun must have been variable. We show that solar evolutionary models that include a realistic planet formation scenario lead to an increased core metallicity of up to 5%, implying that accurate neutrino flux measurements are sensitive to the initial stages of the formation of the Solar System.</description>

Galaxy clusters and cosmic voids are the most extreme objects of our Universe in terms of mass and size, tracing two opposite sides of the large-scale matter density field. By studying their abundance as a function of their mass and radius, respectively, i.e. the halo mass function (HMF) and void size function (VSF), it is possible to achieve fundamental constraints on the cosmological model. While the HMF has already been extensively exploited providing robust constraints on the main cosmological model parameters (e.</description>

This work suggests how to search for streaming constituents from the dark sector. Following cosmological reasoning, a very large number of dark fine grained streams are expected in the Galaxy. Within the solar system, planetary gravitational focusing is effective for the slow DM particles, with possible strong flux enhancements only for streaming dark constituents. The present simulation incorporates gravitational effects preceding their encounter with Earth bound detectors.</description>

The observational data on ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECR), in particular their mass composition, show strong indications for extremely hard spectra of individual mass groups of CR nuclei at Earth. In this work, we show that such hard spectra can be the result of the finite life-time of UHECR sources, if a few individual sources dominate the UHECR flux at the highest energies. In this case, time delays induced by deflections in the turbulent extragalactic magnetic field as well as from the diffusive or advective escape from the source environment can suppress low-energy CRs, leading to a steepening of the observed spectrum.</description>

The nearby GRB22109A at redshift $z=0.1505$ has been observed up to a maximum energy of 18 TeV with the LHAASO air shower array. The expected optical depth for a photon with energy $E_\gamma=18$ TeV varies between 9.2 and 27.1 according to existing models of the extra-galactic background light (EBL) in the relevant mid infra-red range. The resulting suppression of the flux in several EBL models makes it unlikely that this photon could have been observed.</description>

We present SKiLLS, a suite of multi-band image simulations for the KiDS-Legacy analysis, the weak lensing analysis of the complete Kilo-Degree Survey. The resulting catalogues enable joint shear and redshift calibration, enhancing the realism and hence accuracy over previous efforts. To create a large volume of simulated galaxies with faithful properties and to a sufficient depth, we integrate cosmological simulations with high-quality imaging observations. We also improve the realism of simulated images by allowing the point spread function (PSF) to differ between CCD images, including stellar density variations and varying noise levels between pointings.</description>

Line-of-sight effects in strong gravitational lensing have long been treated as a nuisance. However, it was recently proposed that the line-of-sight shear could be a cosmological observable in its own right, if it is not degenerate with lens model parameters. Using the formalism introduced by Fleury et al. (2021a), we firstly demonstrate that the line-of-sight shear can be accurately measured from a simple simulated strong lensing image with percent precision.</description>

Plasma diagnostics are the bases of investigation into the physical and chemical properties of line-emitting gaseous systems. To perform plasma diagnostics properly, it is essential to correct the input spectrum for extinction properly. This is simply because determining the degree of extinction is dependent on the physical properties of the line-emitting gas. Hence, both extinction correction and plasma diagnostics have to be performed simultaneously and self-consistently.</description>

      <description>First author: Ze-Wei Zhao
Interacting dark energy (IDE) scenario assumes that there exists a direct interaction between dark energy and cold dark matter, but this interaction is hard to be tightly constrained by the current data. Finding new cosmological probes to precisely measure this interaction could deepen our understanding of dark energy and dark matter. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) will be seen in large numbers by future radio telescopes, and thus they have potential to become a promising low-redshift cosmological probe.</description>

      <description>First author: Zachary Gelles
Images of supermassive black holes produced using very long baseline interferometry provide a pathway to directly observing effects of a highly curved spacetime, such as a bright photon ring&#39;&#39; that arises from strongly lensed emission. In addition, the emission near supermassive black holes is highly variable, with bright high-energy flares regularly observed. We demonstrate that intrinsic variability can introduce prominent associated changes in the relative brightness of the photon ring.</description>

      <description>First author: G. Banyard
Recent evolutionary computations predict that a few percent of massive OB stars in binary systems should have a dormant BH companion. Despite several reported X-ray quiet OB+BH systems over the last couple of years, finding them with certainty remains challenging. These have great importance as they can be gravitational wave (GW) source progenitors, and are landmark systems in constraining supernova kick physics. This work aims to characterise the hidden companions to the single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1s) in the B star population of the young open Galactic cluster NGC 6231 to find candidate systems for harbouring compact object companions.</description>

The diffuse, unresolved sky provides most of the photons that the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) receives, yet remains poorly understood. HST Archival Legacy program SKYSURF aims to measure the 0.2-1.7 $\mu$m sky surface brightness (sky-SB) from over 200,000 HST images. We describe two sky-SB measurement algorithms designed for SKYSURF (the Percentile-clip and ProFound Median methods), that are able to recover the input sky-SB from simulated images to within 1% uncertainty, and present measurements estimated using each algorithm on the entire SKYSURF database.</description>

      <description>First author: Kyle Boone
The light from a source at a distance d will arrive at detectors separated by 100 AU at times that differ by as much as 120 (d/100 Mpc)^{-1} nanoseconds because of the curvature of the wavefront. At gigahertz frequencies, the arrival time difference can be determined to better than a nanosecond with interferometry. If the space-time positions of the detectors are known to a few centimeters, comparable to the accuracy to which very long baseline interferometry baselines and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) geolocations are constrained, nanosecond timing would allow competitive cosmological constraints.</description>

      <description>First author: Tomonori Totani
Searching for extrasolar biosignatures is important to understand life on Earth and its origin. Astronomical observations of exoplanets may find such signatures, but it is difficult and may be impossible to claim unambiguous detection of life by remote sensing of exoplanet atmospheres. Here, another approach is considered: collecting grains ejected by asteroid impacts from habitable exoplanets in the Milky Way and then traveling to the Solar System.</description>

      <description>First author: Misao Sasaki
We propose a novel mechanism for significantly enhancing the amplitude of primordial electromagnetic fields during inflation. Similar to existing proposals, our idea is based on parametric resonance effects due to conformal-symmetry-breaking coupling of the gauge field and the inflaton. Our proposed scenario, however, significantly differs from previously studied models, and avoids their shortcomings. We, particularly, construct a viable system where the gauge field is exponentially amplified on super-horizon scales, therefore evading the no-go theorem formulated on the basis of widely encountered drastic back-reaction of the magnetic field energy on the inflationary background.</description>

We present an in-depth study of a large and long duration ($&amp;gt;$1.3 days) X-ray flare observed on an RS CVn type eclipsing binary system SZ Psc using observations from Swift observatory. In the 0.35$-$10 keV energy band, the peak luminosity is estimated to be 4.2$\times$10$^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The quiescent corona of SZ Psc was observed $\sim$5.67 d after the flare using Swift observatory, and also $\sim$1.</description>

Debris disc architecture presents [exo-]planetary scientists with precious clues for processes of planet formation and evolution, including constraints on planetary mass perturbers (hidden or not). This is particularly true of the disc in HD 106906 which in early HST, then follow up polarimetric observations, presented asymmetries and needle-like features that have been attributed to perturbations by a massive, and unusually distant planetary companion external to the disc.</description>

      <description>First author: Tariq Yasin
Rotation curves are the key observational manifestation of the dark matter distribution around late-type galaxies. In a halo model context, the precision of constraints on halo parameters is a complex function of the properties of the measurements as well as properties of the galaxy itself. Forthcoming surveys will resolve rotation curves to varying degrees of precision, or measure their integrated effect in the HI linewidth. To ascertain the relative significance of the relevant quantities for constraining halo properties, we study the information on halo mass and concentration as quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the kinematics-informed posterior from the uninformative prior.</description>

The total mass of the Local Group (LG) and the masses of its primary constituents, the Milky Way and M31, are important anchors for several cosmological questions. In recent years, independent measurements have consistently yielded halo masses close to $10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$ for the MW, and $1-2 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$ for M31, while estimates derived from the pair&amp;rsquo;s kinematics via the `timing argument&amp;rsquo; have yielded a combined mass of around $5 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$.</description>

We use data from the Magellanic Edges Survey (MagES) in combination with Gaia EDR3 to study the extreme southern outskirts of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), focussing on a field at the eastern end of a long arm-like structure which wraps around the southern periphery of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Unlike the remainder of this structure, which is thought to be comprised of perturbed LMC disk material, the aggregate properties of the field indicate a clear connection with the SMC.</description>

We present the latest and most precise characterization of the architecture for the ancient ($\approx 11$ Gyr) Kepler-444 system, which is composed of a K0 primary star (Kepler-444 A) hosting five transiting planets, and a tight M-type spectroscopic binary (Kepler-444 BC) with an A-BC projected separation of 66 au. We have measured the system&amp;rsquo;s relative astrometry using the adaptive optics imaging from Keck/NIRC2 and Kepler-444 A&amp;rsquo;s radial velocities from the Hobby Eberly Telescope, and re-analyzed relative radial velocities between BC and A from Keck/HIRES.</description>

The footprint of LoTSS-DR2 covers 309 PSZ2 galaxy clusters, 83 of which host a radio halo and 26 host a radio relic(s). It provides us an excellent opportunity to statistically study the properties of extended cluster radio sources, especially their connection with merging activities. We aim to quantify cluster dynamic states to investigate their relation with the occurrence of extended radio sources. We also search for connections between intracluster medium (ICM) turbulence and nonthermal characteristics of radio halos in the LoTSS-DR2.</description>

Observations of the 21-cm line from primordial hydrogen promise to be one of the best tools to study the early epochs of the Universe: the Dark Ages, the Cosmic Dawn, and the subsequent Epoch of Reionization. In 2018, the EDGES experiment caught the attention of the cosmology community with a potential detection of an absorption feature in the sky-averaged radio spectrum centred at 78 MHz.</description>

Star formation histories (SFHs) are integral to our understanding of galaxy evolution. We can study recent SFHs by comparing the star formation rate (SFR) calculated using different tracers, as each probes a different timescale. We aim to calibrate a proxy for the present-day rate of change in SFR, dSFR/dt, which does not require full spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling and depends on as few observables as possible, to guarantee its broad applicability.</description>

In this paper, we present a spherical Fast Multipole Method (sFMM) for ray tracing simulation of gravitational lensing (GL) on a curved sky. The sFMM is a non-trivial extension of the Fast Multiple Method (FMM) to sphere $\mathbb S^2$, and it can accurately solve the Poisson equation with time complexity of $O(N)\log(N)$, where $N$ is the number of particles. It is found that the time complexity of the sFMM is near $O(N)$ and the computational accuracy can reach $10^{-10}$ in our test.</description>

A striking feature of the solar cycle is that at the beginning, sunspots appear around mid-latitudes, and over time the latitudes of emergences migrate towards the equator.The maximum level of activity (e.g., sunspot number) varies from cycle to cycle.For strong cycles, the activity begins early and at higher latitudes with wider sunspot distributions than for weak cycles. The activity and the width of sunspot belts increase rapidly and begin to decline when the belts are still at high latitudes.</description>

Dark matter particles could be the major component of the haloes of galaxies. Their mutual annihilations or decays would produce an indirect signature under the form of high-energy cosmic-rays. The focus of this presentation is on antimatter species, a component so rare that any excess over the background should be easily detected. After a recap on Galactic propagation, I will discuss positrons, antiprotons and anti-nuclei. For each of these species, anomalies have been reported.</description>

      <description>First author: Yuxi Lu
The intermediate period gap, discovered by Kepler, is an observed dearth of stellar rotation periods in the temperature-period diagram at $\sim$ 20 days for G dwarfs and up to $\sim$ 30 days for early-M dwarfs. However, because Kepler mainly targeted solar-like stars, there is a lack of measured periods for M dwarfs, especially those at the fully convective limit. Therefore it is unclear if the intermediate period gap exists for mid- to late-M dwarfs.</description>

We have thus proposed an intelligent X-ray constellation, the Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters (\textit{CATCH}) space mission. Consisting of 126 micro-satellites in three types, \textit{CATCH} will have the capability to perform follow-up observations for a large number of different types of transients simultaneously.</description>

While there has been a plethora of work on `wind tunnel&#39; simulations that study such cold gas in winds, the infall of this gas under gravity is at least equally important, and fundamentally different since cold gas can never entrain. Instead, velocity shear increases and remains unrelenting. If these clouds are growing, they can experience a drag force due to the accretion of low momentum gas, which dominates over ram pressure drag.</description>

      <description>First author: Barbara Perri
This paper is dedicated to the new implicit unstructured coronal code COCONUT, which aims at providing fast and accurate inputs for space weather forecast as an alternative to empirical models. We use all 20 available magnetic maps of the solar photosphere covering the date of the 2nd of July 2019 which corresponds to a solar eclipse on Earth. We use the same standard pre-processing on all maps, then perform coronal MHD simulations with the same numerical and physical parameters.</description>

I discuss the feasibility of a conceptual space-based neutrino detector that utilizes the Ice Giants as Targets for Galactic Neutrinos. The purpose of this research stems from the concept of wanting to find a new method of observing the Galactic Core (GC) of the Milky Way and the Supermassive black hole, Sag A*. Observations of the GC have been made in every accessible wavelength except for the regions of space that are too dense for photons to probe.</description>

The aim of this white paper is to briefly summarize some of the outstanding gaps in the observations and modeling of stellar flares, CMEs, and exoplanetary space weather, and to discuss how the theoretical and computational tools and methods that have been developed in heliophysics can play a critical role in meeting these challenges. The maturity of data-inspired and data-constrained modeling of the Sun-to-Earth space weather chain provides a natural starting point for the development of new, multidisciplinary research and applications to other stars and their exoplanetary systems.</description>

We investigate the cosmological evolution of interstellar dust with a semi-analytical galaxy formation model ($\nu^2$GC), focusing on the evolution of grain size distribution. The model predicts the statistical properties of dust mass and grain size distribution in galaxies across cosmic history. We confirm that the model reproduces the relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity in the local Universe, and that the grain size distributions of the Milky Way (MW)-like sample become similar to the so-called MRN distribution that reproduces the observed MW extinction curve.</description>

Decaying Cold Dark Matter (DCDM) is a model that is currently under investigation regarding primarily the $S_8$ tension between cosmic microwave background (CMB) and certain large-scale structure measurements. The decay into one massive and one (or more) massless daughter particle(s) leads to a suppression of the power spectrum in the late universe that depends on the relative mass splitting $\epsilon=(1-m^2/M^2)/2$ between the mother and massive daughter particle as well as the lifetime $\tau$.</description>

      <description>First author: David Modiano
Very fast novae are novae which evolve exceptionally quickly (on timescales of only days). Due to their rapid evolution, very fast novae are challenging to detect and study, especially at early times. Here we report the discovery, which was made as part of our Transient UV Objects project, of a probable very fast nova in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 300. We detected the rise to the peak (which is rarely observed for very fast novae) in the near-ultraviolet (NUV), with the first detection just ~2 hours after the eruption started.</description>

We analysed the high-resolution (up to $\sim$0.2&amp;quot;) ALMA CO (2-1) and 1.3 mm dust continuum data of eight gas-rich post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) in the local Universe, six of which had been studied by Smercina et al. (2022). In contrast to this study reporting the detections of extraordinarily compact (i.e., unresolved) reservoirs of molecular gas in the six PSBs, our visibility-plane analysis resolves the CO (2-1) emission in all eight PSBs with effective radii ($R_\mathrm{e,CO}$) of $0.</description>

      <description>First author: Lizhong Zhang
We perform 2D axisymmetric radiative relativistic MHD simulations of radiation pressure supported neutron star accretion columns in split-monopole magnetic fields. The accretion columns exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations, which manifest in the luminosity power spectrum as 2-10 kHz peaks, together with broader extensions to somewhat higher frequencies. The peak frequency decreases for wider columns or higher mass accretion rates. In contrast to the case of shorter columns in uniform magnetic fields, pdV work contributes substantially to maintaining the radiation pressure inside the column against sideways radiative cooling.</description>

Brown dwarfs and very low mass stars are a significant fraction of stars in our galaxy, and they are interesting laboratories to investigate planet formation in extreme conditions of low temperature and densities. In addition, the dust radial drift of particles is expected to be a more difficult barrier to overcome during the first steps of planet formation in these disks. ALMA high-angular resolution observations of few protoplanetary disks around BDs and VLMS have shown substructures as in the disks around Sun-like stars.</description>

We perform a combined analysis of the extensive photometry obtained by the TESS space mission along with previously published observations to obtain a full orbital and physical solution for the system. We measure the following model-independent masses and radii: M1 = 1.3094+/-0.0051 Msun, M2 = 1.0896+/-0.0034 Msun, R1 = 1.</description>

We report the discovery of a two-dimensional Galaxy Manifold within the multi-dimensional luminosity space of local galaxies. The multi-dimensional luminosity space is constructed using 11 bands that span from far ultraviolet to near-infrared for redshift &amp;lt; 0.1 galaxies observed with GALEX, SDSS, and UKIDSS. The two latent parameters are sufficient to express 93.2% of the variance in the galaxy sample, suggesting that this Galaxy Manifold is one of the most efficient representations of galaxies.</description>

Our ground-based optical observations show it is likely to be a Type IIb SN, the explosion of a yellow supergiant, and its infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) $\approx$200 days after explosion shows two distinct components, which we attribute to hot gas and warm dust in the SN ejecta.</description>

The first JWST data on the massive colliding cluster El Gordo confirm 23 known families of multiply lensed images and identify 8 new members of these families. Based on these families, which have been confirmed spectroscopically by MUSE, we derived an initial lens model. This model guided the identification of 37 additional families of multiply lensed galaxies, among which 28 are entirely new systems, and 9 were previously known.</description>

The K2 mission of the Kepler Space Telescope allowed the observations of light curves of small solar system bodies throughout the whole Solar system. In this paper we present the results of a collection of K2 transneptunian object observations, between Campaigns C03 (November 2014 &amp;ndash; February 2015) to C19 (August &amp;ndash; September, 2018), which includes 66 targets. Due to the faintness of our targets the detectability rate of a light curve period is $\sim$56%, notably lower than in the case of other small body populations, like Hildas or Jovian trojans.</description>

      <description>First author: Hao Li
It is reported that the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) observed very high energy photons from GRB 221009A, with the highest energy reaching 18 TeV. We find that observation of such high energy photons is a quite nontrivial fact since extragalactic background light could absorb these photons severely and the flux is too weak to be observed. Therefore we discuss the potential new mechanism for us to observe these photons, and suggest that Lorentz invariance violation induced threshold anomaly of the process (\gamma\gamma\to e^-e^+) provides a candidate to explain this phenomenon.</description>

Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) are excellent probes of the reionization process, as they must be surrounded by large ionized bubbles in order to be visible during the reionization era. Large ionized regions are thought to correspond to over-dense regions and may be protoclusters, making them interesting test-beds for early massive structures. Close associations containing several LAEs are often assumed to mark over-dense, ionized bubbles. Here, we develop the first framework to quantify the ionization and density fields of high-z galaxy associations.</description>

Measuring the magnetic field in cosmic filaments reveals how the Universe is magnetised and the process that magnetised it. Using the Rotation Measures (RM) at 144-MHz from the LoTSS DR2 data, we analyse the rms of the RM extragalactic component as a function of redshift to investigate the evolution with redshift of the magnetic field in filaments. From previous results, we find that the extragalactic term of the RM rms at 144-MHz is dominated by the contribution from filaments (more than 90 percent).</description>

      <description>First author: Mark Hindmarsh
Nielsen-Olesen vortices in the Abelian-Higgs (AH) model are the simplest realisations of cosmic strings in a gauge field theory. Large-scale numerical solutions show that the dominant decay channel of a network of AH strings produced from random initial conditions is classical field radiation. However, they also show that with special initial conditions, loops of string can be created for which classical field radiation is suppressed, and which behave like Nambu-Goto (NG) strings with a dominant decay channel into gravitational radiation.</description>

Obscuring winds driven away from active supermassive black holes are rarely seen due to their transient nature. They have been observed with multi-wavelength observations in a few Seyfert 1 galaxies and one broad absorption line radio-quiet quasar so far. An X-ray obscuration event in MR 2251-178 was caught in late 2020, which triggered multi-wavelength (NIR to X-ray) observations targeting this radio-quiet quasar. In the X-ray band, the obscurer leads to a flux drop in the soft X-ray band from late 2020 to early 2021.</description>

Massive colliding-wind binaries that host a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star present a potentially important source of dust and chemical enrichment in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the chemical composition and survival of dust formed from such systems is not well understood. The carbon-rich WR (WC) binary WR~140 presents an ideal astrophysical laboratory for investigating these questions given its well-defined orbital period and predictable dust-formation episodes every 7.</description>

Accurate determination of the rates of nova eruptions in different kinds of galaxies give us strong constraints on those galaxies&amp;rsquo; underlying white dwarf and binary populations, and those stars&amp;rsquo; spatial distributions. Until 2016, limitations inherent in ground-based surveys of external galaxies - and dust extinction in the Milky Way - significantly hampered the determination of those rates and how much they differ between different types of galaxies.</description>

      <description>First author: Kunal P. Mooley
The afterglow of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 gave evidence for a structured relativistic jet and a link between such mergers and short gamma-ray bursts. Superluminal motion, found using radio very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), together with the afterglow light curve provided constraints on the viewing angle (14-28 degrees), the opening angle of the jet core (less than about 5 degrees), and a modest limit on the initial Lorentz factor of the jet core (more than 4).</description>

      <description>First author: Danial Langeroodi
The mid-infrared spectra of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) are characterized by characteristic broad PAH emission features at 3$-$20 $\mu$m. As these features are redshifted, they are predicted to dominate the flux at specific mid-infrared wavelengths, leading to substantial redshift-dependent color variations in broad-band photometry. The advent of JWST for the first time allows the study of this effect for normal SFGs. Based on spectral energy distribution templates, we here present tracks in mid-infrared (4.</description>

Solar active regions (ARs) play a fundamental role in driving many of the geo-effective eruptions which propagate into the Solar System. However, we are still unable to consistently predict where and when ARs will occur across the solar disk by identifying pre-emergence signatures in observables such as the Doppler velocity (without using Helioseismic methods). Here we aim to determine the earliest time at which pre-emergence signatures, specifically the Horizontal Divergent Flow (HDF), can be confidently detected using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory&amp;rsquo;s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI).</description>

We investigate the synergy of upcoming galaxy surveys and gravitational wave (GW) experiments in constraining late-time cosmology, examining the cross-correlations between the weak lensing of gravitational waves (GW-WL) and the galaxy fields. Without focusing on any specific GW detector configuration, we benchmark the requirements for the high-precision measurement of cosmological parameters by considering several scenarios, varying the number of detected GW events and the uncertainty on the inference of the source luminosity distance and redshift.</description>

      <description>First author: Ananda Hota
AGN feedback during galaxy merger has been the most favoured model to explain black hole-galaxy co-evolution. However, how the AGN-driven jet/wind/radiation is coupled with the gas of the merging galaxies, which leads to positive feedback, momentarily enhanced star formation, and subsequently negative feedback, a decline in star formation, is poorly understood. Only a few cases are known where the jet and companion galaxy interaction leads to minor off-axis distortions in the jets and enhanced star formation in the gas-rich minor companions.</description>

The Wolf-Rayet (WR) binary system WR140 is a close (0.9-16.7 mas) binary star consisting of an O5 primary and WC7 companion and is known as the archetype of episodic dust-producing WRs. Dust in WR binaries is known to form in a confined stream originating from the collision of the two stellar winds, with orbital motion of the binary sculpting the large-scale dust structure into arcs as dust is swept radially outwards.</description>

The LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave detectors have confidently observed 4 events involving neutron stars: two binary neutron star (BNS) mergers (GW170817 and GW190425), and two neutron star-black hole mergers (GW200105 and GW200115). However, our theoretical understanding of the remnant properties of such systems is incomplete due to the complexities related to the modeling of matter effects and the very high computational cost of corresponding numerical relativity simulations.</description>

The spectral index $n_s$ of scalar perturbation is the significant initial condition set by inflation theory for our observable Universe. According to Planck results, current constraint is $n_s = 0.965\pm 0.004$, while an exact scale-invaiant Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum, i.e. $n_s=1$, has been ruled out at $8.4\sigma$ significance level. However, it is well-known that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is suffering from the Hubble tension, which is at $\sim 5\sigma$ significance level.</description>

We present a new open-source data-reduction pipeline to reconstruct spectral data cubes from raw SPHERE integral-field spectrograph (IFS) data. The pipeline is written in Python and based on the pipeline that was developed for the CHARIS IFS. It introduces several improvements to SPHERE data analysis that ultimately produce significant improvements in postprocessing sensitivity. We first used new data to measure SPHERE lenslet point spread functions (PSFs) at the four laser calibration wavelengths.</description>

We present LOFAR imaging observations from the April/May 2020 active episode of magnetar SGR 1935+2154. We place the earliest radio limits on persistent emission following the low-luminosity fast radio burst FRB 200428 from the magnetar. We also perform an image-plane search for transient emission and find no radio flares during our observations. We examine post-FRB radio upper limits in the literature and find that all are consistent with the multi-wavelength afterglow predicted by the synchrotron maser shock model interpretation of FRB 200428.</description>

Scalar field dark matter offers an interesting alternative to the traditional WIMP dark matter picture. Astrophysical and cosmological simulations are useful to constraining the mass of the dark matter particle in this model. This is particularly true at low mass where the wavelike nature of the dark matter particle manifests on astrophysical scales. These simulations typical use a classical field approximation. In this work, we look at extending these simulations to include quantum corrections.</description>

Our statistical analysis focuses primarily on the 984 supernovae discovered or recovered in ASAS-SN $g$-band observations. The complete sample of 2427 ASAS-SN supernovae includes earlier $V$-band samples and unrecovered supernovae. For each supernova, we identify the host galaxy, its UV to mid-IR photometry, and the offset of the supernova from the center of the host.</description>

Future Gaia and Legacy Survey of Space and Time data releases, together with wide area spectroscopic surveys, will deliver large samples of resolved binary stars with phase space coordinates, albeit with low-cadence. Given an eccentricity law $f(\epsilon)$, we derive properties of (i) the velocity distribution $v/\sqrt{G M/r}$ normalised by the value for a circular orbit at the measured separation $r$; (ii) the astrometric acceleration distributions $a/\left(G M/r^2\right)$ again normalised to the circular orbit value.</description>

Modeling the internal chemistry of molecular clouds is critical to accurately simulating their evolution. To reduce computational expense, 3D simulations generally restrict their chemical modeling to species with strong heating and cooling effects. We address this by post-processing tracer particles in the SILCC-Zoom molecular cloud simulations. Using a chemical network of 39 species and 299 reactions (including freeze-out of CO and H$2$O), and a novel iterative algorithm to reconstruct a filled density grid from sparse tracer particle data, we produce time-dependent density distributions for various species.</description>

Disc winds and planet formation are considered to be two of the most important mechanisms that drive the evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary discs and in turn define the environment in which planets form and evolve. While both have been studied extensively in the past, we combine them into one model by performing three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of giant planet hosting discs that are undergoing X-ray photo-evaporation, with the goal to analyse the interactions between both mechanisms.</description>

We study the effects of dark matter self-interactions on the local dark matter distribution in selected Milky Way-like galaxies in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulations. The simulations were run with two different self-interacting dark matter models, a constant and velocity-dependent self-interaction cross-section. We find that the local dark matter velocity distribution of the Milky Way-like halos in the simulations with dark matter self-interactions and baryons are generally similar to those extracted from cold collisionless dark matter simulations with baryons.</description>

NGC 2915 is a unique nearby galaxy that is classified as an isolated blue compact dwarf based on its optical appearance but has an extremely extended H I gas disk with prominent Sd-type spiral arms. To unveil the starburst-triggering mystery of NGC 2915, we perform a comprehensive analysis of deep VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopic observations that cover the central kiloparsec star-forming region. We find that episodes of bursty star formation have recurred in different locations throughout the central region, and the most recent one peaked around 50 Myr ago.</description>

The quasiparticle propagation away from the track of a highly ionizing particle in superfluid helium at low temperatures has previously been shown to exhibit anisotropy. We discuss the mechanism responsible for this behavior and show that it occurs for nuclear scattering by dark matter for recoil energies down to a few keV, and perhaps lower. This makes it possible to extend WIMP searches with interaction cross sections that reach into the neutrino floor in a meaningful energy range.</description>

We present a catalogue of over 7000 sources from the GLEAM survey which have significant structure on sub-arcsecond scales at 162MHz. The compact nature of these sources was detected and quantified via their Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS) signature, measured in interferometric images from the Murchison Widefield Array. The advantage of this approach is that all sufficiently compact sources across the survey area are included down to a well-defined flux density limit.</description>

Context. A universally accepted definition of what a vortex is has not yet been reached. Therefore, we lack an unambiguous and rigorous method for the identification of vortices in fluid flows. Such a method would be necessary to conduct robust statistical studies on vortices in highly dynamical and turbulent systems, such as the solar atmosphere. Aims. We aim to develop an innovative and robust automated methodology for the identification of vortices based on local and global characteristics of the flow.</description>

      <description>First author: Adam Hibberd
Comet C/2014 UN${271}$, alternative designation &amp;lsquo;BB&amp;rsquo; after its discoverers &amp;lsquo;Bernardinelli/Bernstein&amp;rsquo;, and commonly referred to as UN${271}$, is an extreme case on two fronts, firstly its solar distance on discovery ($&amp;gt;$ 29 au) and secondly the size of its nucleus (137$\pm$ 15 km). With an aphelion distance of $\sim$33,000 au (w.r.t. the solar system barycentre) and an orbital period $\sim$2 million years, it is definitely an object from the solar system&amp;rsquo;s Oort cloud, and also by a good measure the largest Oort cloud object ever observed.</description>

The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) is a 4-meter class survey telescope that has recently achieved first light and is expected to swing into full operations by 1st January 2023. It scans the sky in a fixed 22&amp;rsquo; wide strip centered at the declination of $+29^o21&#39;41&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;$ and works in Time Delay Integration (TDI) mode. We present a full catalog of sources in the ILMT strip that can serve as astrometric calibrators.</description>

      <description>First author: BICEP/Keck Collaboration
We characterize Galactic dust filaments by correlating BICEP/Keck and Planck data with polarization templates based on neutral hydrogen (HI) observations. Dust polarization is important for both our understanding of astrophysical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM) and the search for primordial gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In the diffuse ISM, HI is strongly correlated with the dust and partly organized into filaments that are aligned with the local magnetic field.</description>

Liller 1 and Terzan 5 are two massive systems in the Milky-Way bulge hosting populations characterized by significantly different ages ($\Delta t&amp;gt;7-8$ Gyr) and metallicities ($\Delta$[Fe/H]$\sim1$ dex). Their origin is still strongly debated in the literature and all formation scenarios proposed so far require some level of fine-tuning. The detailed star formation histories (SFHs) of these systems may represent an important piece of information to assess their origin.</description>

      <description>First author: Dirk Scholte
Gas plays an important role in many processes in galaxy formation and evolution, but quantifying the importance of gas has been hindered by the challenge to measure gas masses for large samples of galaxies. Datasets of direct atomic and molecular gas measurements are sufficient to establish simple scaling relations, but often not large enough to quantify three-parameter relations, or second order dependencies. As an alternative approach, we derive here indirect cold gas measurements from optical emission lines using photoionization models for galaxies in the SDSS main galaxy sample and the PHANGS-MUSE survey.</description>

In this work we present updated forecasts on parameterised modifications of gravity that can capture deviations of the behaviour of cosmological density perturbations beyond $\Lambda$CDM. For these forecasts we adopt the SKA Observatory (SKAO) as a benchmark for future cosmological surveys at radio frequencies, combining a continuum survey for weak lensing and angular galaxy clustering with an HI galaxy survey for spectroscopic galaxy clustering that can detect baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions.</description>

Starobinsky inflation is an attractive, fundamental model to explain the Planck measurements, and its higher-order extension may allow us to probe quantum gravity effects. We show that future CMB data combined with the 21cm intensity map from SKA will meaningfully probe such an extended Starobinsky model. A combined analysis will provide a precise measurement and intriguing insight into inflationary dynamics, even accounting for correlations with astrophysical parameters.</description>

      <description>First author: Yang Liu
We establish a new cosmological-model-independent method to determine the Hubble constant $H_0$ from the localized FRBs and the Hubble parameter measurements and obtain a first such determination $H_0=70.60\pm2.11~\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ of about 3.00% uncertainty with data from the eighteen localized FRBs and nineteen Hubble parameter measurements in the redshift range $0&amp;lt;z\leq0.66$. This value, which is independent of the cosmological model, lies in the middle of the results from the Planck CMB observations and the nearby type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data.</description>

The three-dimensional correlation function offers an effective way to summarize the correlation of the large-scale structure even for imaging galaxy surveys. We have applied the projected three-dimensional correlation function, $\xi_{\rm p}$ to measure the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scale on the first-three years Dark Energy Survey data. The sample consists of about 7 million galaxies in the redshift range $ 0.6 &amp;lt; z_{\rm p } &amp;lt; 1.</description>

Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) inside the heliosphere are affected by magnetic turbulence and Solar wind disturbances which result in the so-called solar modulation effect. To investigate this phenomenon, we have performed a data-driven analysis of the temporal dependence of the GCR flux over the solar cycle. With a global statistical inference of GCR data collected in space by AMS-02, PAMELA, and CRIS on monthly basis, we have determined the dependence of the GCR diffusion parameters upon time and rigidity.</description>

This study aims at timing the eclipses of the binary star TU UMi. The times of minima are taken from the literature, from our observations in April 2004 and from TESS observations between 2019 and 2022. The orbital period analysis of the system indicates that there is a cyclic oscillation with an amplitude of 0.0081d and a period of 9.03 yr, accompanied by a continuous decrease at a rate of $dP/dt =-1.</description>

We assess the dependence of Earth&amp;rsquo;s disk-integrated mid-infrared thermal emission spectrum on observation geometries and investigate which and how spectral features are impacted by seasonality on Earth. We compiled an exclusive dataset containing 2690 disk-integrated thermal emission spectra for four different full-disk observing geometries (North &amp;amp; South Pole centered and Africa &amp;amp; Pacific centred equatorial views) over four consecutive years. The spectra were derived from 2378 spectral channels in the wavelength range from 3.</description>

We report on recent progress in the search for dark matter particles with masses from 1 MeV to 1 GeV. Several dark matter candidates in this mass range are expected to generate measurable electronic-recoil signals in direct-detection experiments. We focus on dark matter particles scattering with electrons in semiconductor detectors since they have fundamentally the highest sensitivity due to their low ionization threshold. Charge-coupled device (CCD) silicon detectors are the leading technology, with significant progress expected in the coming years.</description>

The 2-m aperture Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST), which observes at wavelengths ranging from 255 to 1000 nm, is expected to start science operations in 2024. An ultra-deep field observation program covering approximately 10 square degrees is proposed with supernovae (SNe) and other transients as one of its primary science drivers. This paper presents the simulated detection results of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and explores the impact of new datasets on the determinations of cosmological parameters.</description>

We conduct hydrodynamical cosmological zoom simulations of fourteen voids to study the ability of haloes to accrete gas at different locations throughout the voids at z = 0. Measuring the relative velocity of haloes with respect to their ambient gas, we find that a tenth of the haloes are expected to be unable to accrete external gas due to its fast flow passed them (so called &amp;lsquo;fast flow haloes&amp;rsquo;).</description>

Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) show rich phenomenology in the spectral and timing properties. We collected the spectral data of 20 BHXBs from the literature across different spectral states. The spectral properties are studied in the forms of the inner disc temperature ($T_{\rm in}$), photon index ($\Gamma$), hot electron temperature ($kT_{\rm e}$), X-ray flux ($F_{\rm X}$) and luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$). We studied various correlations among different spectral parameters to understand the accretion process on a global scale.</description>

A particular open problem in cosmology is whether dark matter on small scales is clumpy, forming gravitationally-bound halos distributed within the Galaxy. The practical difficulties inherent in testing this hypothesis stem from the fact that, on astrophysical scales, dark matter is solely observable via its gravitational interaction with other objects. This thesis presents a gravitational-lensing-based solution for the mapping and characterisation of low-mass, dark matter halos via their signature in millisecond pulsar observations.</description>

Precision cosmology with gravitational wave (GW) sources requires understanding the interplay between GW source population and cosmological parameters governing the dynamics of the Universe. With the fast increase of GW detections, for exploring many aspects of cosmology and fundamental physics it is necessary to develop a tool which can simulate GW mock samples for several population and cosmological models with and without a galaxy catalog. We have developed a new code called GWSim, allowing to make GW mock events from a large range of configurations, varying the cosmology, the merger rate, and the GW source parameters (mass and spin distributions in particular), for a given network of GW detectors.</description>

This study aims to characterise, for the first time, intranight optical variability (INOV) of low-mass active galactic nuclei (LMAGN) which host a black hole (BH) of mass $M_{BH} \sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$, i.e., even less massive than the Galactic centre black hole Sgr A* and 2-3 orders of magnitude below the supermassive black holes (SMBH, $M_{BH}$ $\sim$ $10^8 - 10^9 M_{\odot}$) which are believed to power quasars. Thus, LMAGN are a crucial subclass of AGN filling the wide gap between SMBH and stellar-mass BHs of Galactic X-ray binaries.</description>

Recent work uncovered features in the phase space of the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s stellar halo which may be attributed to the last major merger. When stellar material from a satellite is accreted onto its host, it phase mixes and appears finely substructured in phase space. For a high-eccentricity merger, this substructure most clearly manifests as numerous wrapping chevrons in $(v_r, r)$ space, corresponding to stripes in $(E, \theta_r)$ space.</description>

      <description>First author: P. Gaulme
KIC 7955301 is a hierarchical triple system with eclipse timing and depth variations discovered by the Kepler mission. It is composed of a non-eclipsing primary star at the bottom of the red giant branch on a 209-day orbit with a K/G-type main-sequence inner eclipsing binary, orbiting in 15.3 days. This system was noted for the large amplitude of its eclipse timing variations (4 hours), and the clear solar-like oscillations of the red-giant component, including p-modes of degree up to l=3 and mixed l=1 modes.</description>

      <description>First author: Qingyun Deng
Lithosphere is the outer rigid part of terrestrial body, usually consisting of the crust and part of the mantle. Characterizing the physical properties of lithosphere is critical in the investigation to its evolution history. Through the modeling of mass-related loads within lithosphere, physical parameters such as elastic thickness of lithosphere can be inferred by gravity and topography data. At impact basin region, however, the low correlation between topography and gravity makes this model inapplicable.</description>

      <description>First author: Yasushi Suto
We develop a general framework to compute photometric variations induced by the oblique rotation of a star with an axisymmetric inhomogeneous surface. We apply the framework to compute lightcurves of white dwarfs adopting two simple models of their surface inhomogeneity. Depending on the surface model and the location of the observer, the resulting lightcurve exhibits a departure from a purely sinusoidal curve that are observed for a fraction of white dwarfs.</description>

      <description>First author: Sahana Kumar
We present multi-wavelength time-series spectroscopy of SN 2013aa and SN 2017cbv, two Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) on the outskirts of the same host galaxy, NGC 5643. This work utilizes new nebular-phase near-infrared (NIR) spectra obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project-II, in addition to previously published optical and NIR spectra. By measuring nebular-phase [Fe II] lines in both the optical and NIR, we examine the explosion kinematics and test the efficacy of several emission line fitting techniques commonly used in the literature.</description>

We present a new Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) sample of 14 radio Supernova Remnant (SNR) candidates in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This new sample is a significant increase to the known number of older, larger and low surface brightness LMC SNRs. We employ a multi-frequency search for each object and found possible traces of optical and occasionally X-ray emission in several of these 14 SNR candidates.</description>

The observed variability of the cosmic-ray intensity in the interplanetary space is driven by the evolution of the Sun&amp;rsquo;s magnetic activity over its 11-year quasiperiodical cycle. Investigating the relationship between solar activity indices and cosmic-ray intensity measurements is then essential for understanding the fundamental processes of particle transport in the heliosphere. Here we have performed a global characterization the solar modulation of cosmic rays over the solar activity cycle and for different energies of the cosmic particles.</description>

      <description>First author: Michael G. Richer
We study the kinematics of emission lines that arise from many physical processes in NGC 6153 based upon deep, spatially-resolved, high resolution spectra acquired with the UVES spectrograph at the ESO VLT. Our most basic finding is that the plasma in NGC 6153 is complex, especially its temperature structure. The kinematics of most emission lines defines a classic expansion law, with the outer part expanding fastest (normal nebular plasma).</description>

In this paper, we report on the hard X-ray observation of the X-ray pulsar 1E 1145.1-6141 performed with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array mission (NuSTAR). The coherent pulsation of the source with a period of $\sim296.653;\pm;0.021;s $ is detected. The source may be in the equilibrium phase, according to the most recent measurements of its pulse period. The pulse profile reveals a mild energy dependence and generally hints at a pencil-beam pattern.</description>

We explore the bounds that can be placed on interactions between cold dark matter and vacuum energy, with equation of state $w=-1$, using state-of-the-art cosmological observations. We consider linear perturbations about a simple background model where the energy transfer per Hubble time, $Q/H$, is a general linear function of the dark matter density, $\rho_c$, and vacuum energy, $V$. We explain the parameter degeneracies found when fitting cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies alone, and show how these are broken by the addition of supernovae data, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and redshift-space distortions (RSD).</description>

Understanding the chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM) is fundamental for the comprehension of the Galactic and stellar evolution. X-rays provide an excellent way to study the dust chemical composition and crystallinity along different sight-lines in the Galaxy. In this work we study the dust grain chemistry in the diffuse regions of the interstellar medium in the soft X-ray band (&amp;lt;1 keV). We use newly calculated X-ray dust extinction cross sections, obtained from laboratory data, in order to investigate the oxygen K and iron L shell absorption.</description>

We probe what constraints for the global ionized hydrogen fraction the Void Probability Function (VPF) clustering can give for the Lyman-Alpha Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (LAGER) narrowband survey as a function of area. Neutral hydrogen acts like a fog for Lyman-alpha emission, and measuring the drop in the luminosity function of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) has been used to constrain the ionization fraction in narrowband surveys.</description>

      <description>First author: Kaustav K. Das
The fate of stars in the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) range $\approx 8-12$ Msun is unclear. They could evolve to form white dwarfs or explode as electron-capture supernovae (SNe) or iron core-collapse SNe (CCSNe). Even though the initial mass function indicates that this mass range should account for over 40% of all CCSNe progenitors, few have been observationally confirmed, likely owing to the faintness and rapid evolution of these transients.</description>

The {\sl TESS} space mission has recently demonstrated its great potential to discover new pulsating white dwarf and pre-white dwarf stars, and to detect periodicities with high precision in already known white-dwarf pulsators. We report the discovery of two new pulsating He-rich atmosphere white dwarfs (DBVs) and present a detailed asteroseismological analysis of three already known DBV stars employing observations collected by the {\sl TESS} mission along with ground-based data.</description>

In this work, we assess the combined use of Gaia photometry and astrometry with infrared data from CatWISE in improving the identification of extragalactic sources compared to the classification obtained using Gaia data. We evaluate different input feature configurations and prior functions, with the aim of presenting a classification methodology integrating prior knowledge stemming from realistic class distributions in the universe. In our work, we compare different classifiers, namely Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), XGBoost and CatBoost, and classify sources into three classes - star, quasar, and galaxy, with the target quasar and galaxy class labels obtained from SDSS16 and the star label from Gaia EDR3.</description>

We study the radio variability of galaxies with and without sources of hydroxyl (OH) megamaser radiation based on the continuum radio measurements conducted in 2019-2022 with the radio telescope RATAN-600 at frequencies of 2.3, 4.7, 8.2, and 11.2 GHz. Presumably, radio continuum emission significantly affects the megamaser radiation brightness, therefore, such a characteristic as the variability of radio emission is important for determining the OHM galaxies parameters.</description>

I describe a method to estimate response matrices of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing power spectra estimators to the true sky power under realistic conditions. Applicable to all lensing reconstruction pipelines based on quadratic estimators (QE), it uses a small number of Gaussian CMB Monte-Carlos and specially designed QE&amp;rsquo;s in order to obtain sufficiently accurate matrices with little computational effort. This method may be used to improve the modelling of CMB lensing band-powers by incorporating at least some of the non-idealities encountered in CMB lensing reconstruction.</description>

Conformity denotes the correlation of properties between pairs of galaxies as a function of separation. Correlations between properties such as star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, and specific star formation rate (sSFR) have implications for the impact of environment upon galaxy formation and evolution. Conformity between primary galaxies and satellites within the same dark matter halo has been well documented in simulations and observations. However, the existence of conformity at greater distances - known as two-halo conformity - remains uncertain.</description>

Lorentz invariance violation~(LIV) can change the threshold behavior predicted by special relativity and cause threshold anomalies which affect the propagation of cosmic photons. In this work, we focus on the threshold anomaly effect on cosmic photon attenuations by extragalactic background light~(EBL) and discuss how to identify LIV from observations of very high energy~(VHE) photons propagated from long distance in the universe. We point out that the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory~(LHAASO), one of the most sensitive gamma-ray detector arrays currently operating at TeV and PeV energies, is an ideal facility for performing such LIV searching.</description>

We construct a family of simple single-field inflation models consistent with Planck / BICEP Keck bounds which have a parametrically small tensor amplitude and no running of the scalar spectral index. The construction consists of a constant-roll hilltop inflaton potential with the end of inflation left as a free parameter induced by higher-order operators which become dominant late in inflation. This construction directly demonstrates that there is no lower bound on the tensor/scalar ratio for simple single-field inflation models.</description>

We report spectral analysis of the persistent black hole X-ray binary, 4U 1957+115, using AstroSat, Swift and NuSTAR observations carried out between 2016-2019. Modelling with a disk emission, thermal comptonization and blurred reflection components revealed that the source was in the high soft state with the disk flux $\sim 87$ % of the total and high energy photon index $\sim2.6$. There is an evidence that either the inner disk radius varied by $\sim25$ % or the colour hardening factor changed by $\sim12$ %.</description>

Cluster galaxies exhibit substantially lower star formation rates than field galaxies today, but it is conceivable that clusters were sites of more active star formation in the early universe. Herein, we present an interpretation of the star formation history (SFH) of group/cluster galaxies based on the large-scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, Horizon-AGN. We find that massive galaxies in general have small values of e-folding timescales of star formation decay (i.</description>

      <description>First author: Antonio Ambrosone
Starburst galaxies are well-motivated astrophysical emitters of high-energy gamma-rays. They are well-known cosmic-ray &amp;ldquo;reservoirs&amp;rdquo;, thanks to their large magnetic fields which confine high-energy protons for $\sim 10^5$ years. Over such long times, cosmic-ray transport can be significantly affected by scatterings with sub-GeV dark matter. Here we point out that this scattering distorts the cosmic-ray spectrum, and the distortion can be indirectly observed by measuring the gamma-rays produced by cosmic-rays via hadronic collisions.</description>

      <description>First author: Nicola Tomassetti
When traveling in the heliosphere, Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are subjected to the solar modulation effect, a quasi-periodical change of their intensity caused by the 11-year cycle of solar activity. Here we investigate the association of solar activity and cosmic radiation over five solar cycles, from 1965 to 2020, using a collection of multichannel data from neutron monitors, space missions, and solar observatories. In particular, we focus on the time lag between the monthly sunspot number and the GCR flux variations.</description>

      <description>First author: Ioannis Kontogiannis
Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) cause immediate and adverse effects on the interplanetary space and geospace. The deeper understanding of the mechanisms that produce them and the construction of efficient prediction schemes are of paramount importance. The source regions of flares and CMEs exhibit some common morphological characteristics associated with strongly sheared magnetic polarity inversion lines, indicative of the complex magnetic configurations that store huge amounts of free magnetic energy and helicity.</description>

      <description>First author: M. J. Mazur
We present the technical design, construction and testing of the Colibri telescope array at Elginfield Observatory near London, Ontario, Canada. Three 50-cm telescopes are arranged in a triangular array and are separated by 110-160 metres. During operation, they will monitor field stars at the intersections of the ecliptic and galactic plane for serendipitous stellar occultations (SSOs) by trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). At a frame rate of 40 frames per second (fps), Fresnel diffraction in the occultation light curve can be resolved and, with coincident detections, be used to estimate basic properties of the occulting object.</description>

      <description>First author: Andre Izidoro
The size frequency distribution of exoplanet radii between 1 and 4$R_{\oplus}$ is bimodal with peaks at $\sim$1.4 $R_{\oplus}$ and $\sim$2.4 $R_{\oplus}$, and a valley at $\sim$1.8$R_{\oplus}$. This radius valley separates two classes of planets &amp;ndash; usually referred to as &amp;ldquo;super-Earths&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mini-Neptunes&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and its origin remains debated. One model proposes that super-Earths are the outcome of photo-evaporation or core-powered mass-loss stripping the primordial atmospheres of the mini-Neptunes.</description>

Aims. Stars with strong enhancements of r-process elements are rare and tend to be metal-poor, with generally [Fe/H] &amp;lt;-2 dex and found in the halo. In this work we aim to investigate a candidate r-process enriched bulge star with a relatively high metallicity of -0.65 dex, and compare it with a previously published r-rich candidate star in the bulge. Methods. We reconsider the abundance analysis of a high-resolution optical spectrum of the red-giant star 2MASS J18082459-2548444 and determine its europium (Eu) and molybdenum (Mo) abundance, using stellar parameters from five different previous studies.</description>

      <description>First author: Alicia Rouco Escorial
We present a comprehensive study of 29 short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) observed $\approx 0.8-60$ days post-burst using $Chandra$ and $XMM-Newton$. We provide the inferred distributions of SGRB jet opening angles and true event rates to compare against neutron star merger rates. We perform uniform analysis and modeling of their afterglows, obtaining 10 opening angle measurements and 19 lower limits. We report on two new opening angle measurements (SGRBs 050724A and 200411A) and eight updated values, obtaining a median value of $\langle \theta_{\rm j} \rangle \approx 6.</description>

      <description>First author: A. Capetti
This seventh paper of the MUse RAdio Loud Emission lines Snapshot (MURALES) project presents the results of the observations obtained with the VLT/MUSE integral field spectrograph of 3C radio sources and discusses the optical spectral properties of the nuclei of 26 objects with 0.3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.82 (median redshift 0.51). At these redshifts the H$\alpha$ and [NII] emission lines are not covered by optical spectra and alternative diagnostic diagrams are needed to separate the different spectroscopic sub-classes.</description>

      <description>First author: Olivier Deligny
The Pierre Auger Observatory has been detecting ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) for more than fifteen years. An essential feature of the Observatory is its hybrid design: cosmic rays above $100~$PeV are detected through the observation of the associated air showers with different and complementary techniques, from surface detector arrays and fluorescence telescopes to radio antennas. The analyses of the multi-detector data have enabled high-statistics and high-precision studies of the energy spectrum, mass composition and distribution of arrival directions of UHECRs.</description>

We present pre- and post-explosion observations of the Type II-P supernova (SN II-P) 2019mhm located in NGC 6753. Based on optical spectroscopy and photometry, we show that SN 2019mhm exhibits broad lines of hydrogen with a velocity of $-8500\pm200$ km s$^{-1}$ and a $111\pm2$ day extended plateau in its luminosity, typical of the Type II-P subclass. We also fit its late-time bolometric light curve and infer that it initially produced a ${}^{56}$Ni mass of $5.</description>

      <description>First author: Arka Banerjee
In astronomy and cosmology, significant effort is devoted to characterizing and understanding spatial cross-correlations between points - e.g. galaxy positions, high energy neutrino arrival directions, X-ray and AGN sources, and continuous field - e.g. weak lensing and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Recently, we introduced the $k$-nearest neighbor formalism to better characterize the clustering of discrete (point) datasets. Here we extend it to the point-field cross-correlation analysis.</description>

      <description>First author: Nienke van der Marel
Protoplanetary disks surrounding young stars are the birth place of planets. Of particular interest are the transition disks with large inner dust cavities of tens of au, hinting at the presence of massive companions. These cavities were first recognized by a deficit in their Spectral Energy Distribution (SED), later confirmed by millimeter interferometry observations. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has truly revolutionized the field of spatially resolved imaging of protoplanetary disks in both dust and gas, providing important hints for the origin of gaps and cavities.</description>

Aims. We analyze whether the effects of secular perturbations, originating from a substellar companion, on the dust dynamics in a debris disk can be investigated with spatially resolved observations. Methods. We numerically simulated the collisional evolution of narrow and eccentric cold planetesimal belts around a star of spectral type A3V that are secularly perturbed by a companion that orbits either closer to or farther from the star than the belt.</description>

We measure the molecular-to-atomic gas ratio, $R_{\rm mol}$, and the star formation rate (SFR) per unit molecular gas mass, SFE${\rm mol}$, in 38 nearby galaxies selected from the Virgo Environment Traced in CO (VERTICO) survey. We stack ALMA $^{12}$CO(J=2-1) spectra coherently using \hi\ velocities from the VIVA survey to detect faint CO emission out to galactocentric radii $r{\rm gal} \sim 1.2,r_{25}$. We determine the scale-lengths for the molecular and stellar components, finding a $\sim$3:5 relation between them, and indicating that CO emission tends to be more centrally concentrated than stellar mass in VERTICO galaxies when compared to field galaxies.</description>

The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is a rich resource of cosmological information, encoded both in its source statistics and its anisotropies induced by propagation effects. We provide a theoretical description of it, without employing the Boltzmann equation which is exclusively valid in the geometric optics limit. Our formalism is based on the so-called classical matter approximation and it is able to capture wave-optics effects, such as interference and diffraction.</description>

      <description>First author: Scott Hagen
Continuum reverberation mapping of AGN can provide new insight into the nature and geometry of the accretion flow. Some of the X-rays from the central corona irradiating the disc are absorbed, increasing the local disc temperature. This gives an additional re-processed contribution to the spectral energy distribution (SED) which is lagged and smeared relative to the driving X-ray lightcurve. We directly calculate this reverberation from the accretion disc, creating fully time dependent SEDs for a given X-ray light-curve.</description>

We describe the discovery of a solar neighborhood ($d=474$~pc) binary system consisting of a main-sequence sunlike star and a massive non-interacting black hole candidate. We selected this system from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 binary catalog based on its high mass ratio and location close to the main sequence. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the visible star is well described by a single stellar model, indicating that no contribution from another luminous source is needed to fit the observed photometry.</description>

Most stars form in clumpy and sub-structured clusters. These properties also emerge in hydro-dynamical simulations of star-forming clouds, which provide a way to generate realistic initial conditions for $N-$body runs of young stellar clusters. However, producing large sets of initial conditions by hydro-dynamical simulations is prohibitively expensive in terms of computational time. We introduce a novel technique for generating new initial conditions from a given sample of hydro-dynamical simulations, at a tiny computational cost.</description>

Stellar spectral classification, and especially the Yerkes system, has been highly useful in the study of stars. While there is a currently accepted classification system for carbon stars, the subset of Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (HdC) stars has not been well described by such a system, due in part to their rarity and their variability. Here we present a new system for the classification of HdCs based on their spectra, which is made wholly on their observable appearance.</description>

Many studies have looked at the impact of magnetic fields on star formation in molecular clouds and Milky Way like galaxies, concluding that the field suppresses star formation. However, most of these studies are based on fully developed fields that have reached the saturation level, with little work on investigating how the growth phase of a primordial field affects star formation in low metallicity environments.</description>

The formation of the first stars and galaxies during &amp;lsquo;Cosmic Dawn&amp;rsquo; is thought to have imparted a faint signal onto the 21-cm spin temperature from atomic Hydrogen gas in the early Universe. Observationally, an absorption feature should be measurable as a frequency-dependence in the sky-averaged (i.e. global) temperature at meter wavelengths. This signal should be separable from the smooth &amp;ndash; but orders of magnitude brighter &amp;ndash; foregrounds by jointly fitting a log-polynomial and absorption trough to radiometer spectra.</description>

Beginning in 2016, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has sent out alerts in real time containing the information of high-energy ($E \gtrsim 100$~TeV) neutrino candidate events with moderate-to-high ($\gtrsim 30$%) probability of astrophysical origin. In this work, we use a recent catalog of such alert events, which, in addition to events announced in real-time, includes events that were identified retroactively, and covers the time period of 2011-2020.</description>

Gravitational waves from merging binary black holes can be used to shed light on poorly understood aspects of massive binary stellar evolution, such as the evolution of massive stars (including their mass-loss rates), the common envelope phase, and the rate at which massive stars form throughout the cosmic history of the Universe. In this paper we explore the \emph{correlated} impact of these phases on predictions for the merger rate and chirp mass distribution of merging binary black holes, aiming to identify possible degeneracies between model parameters.</description>

      <description>First author: R. de la Fuente Marcos
Context. Most flybys in the Galactic disk are distant, beyond 10,000 AU, and have characteristic velocities of about 70 km/s. However, deep and fast encounters also take place, albeit with lower probability, particularly if one of the objects involved is a stellar remnant ejected during a supernova. WD 0810-353 might be a high velocity white dwarf, and it was recently identified as heading straight for the Solar System; however, the Gaia DR3 data that support its future deep and fast flyby are regarded as suspicious.</description>

      <description>First author: Danilo F. Rocha
Westerlund 1 (Wd 1) is one of the most relevant star clusters in the Milky Way to study massive star formation, although it is still poorly known. Here, we used photometric and spectroscopic data to model the eclipsing binary W36, showing that its spectral type is O6.5 III + O9.5 IV, hotter and more luminous than thought before. Its distance $d_{\rm W36}$ $=$ 4.03$\pm$0.25 kpc agrees, within the errors, with three recent Gaia-EDR3-based distances reported in Paper I, Beasor &amp;amp; Davies, and by Negueruela&amp;rsquo;s group.</description>

During the Noachian, Mars&amp;rsquo; crust may have provided a favorable environment for microbial life. The porous brine-saturated regolith would have created a physical space sheltered from UV and cosmic radiations and provided a solvent, while the below-ground temperature and diffusion of a dense reduced atmosphere may have supported simple microbial organisms that consume H2 and CO2 as energy and carbon sources and produce methane as a waste.</description>

Driven by the imminent need to rapidly process and classify millions of AGN spectra drawn from next generation astronomical facilities, we present a spectral fitting routine for Type 2 AGN spectra optimised for high volume processing, using the Quasar Spectral Fitting library (QSFit). We analyse an optically selected sample of 813 luminous Type 2 AGN spectra at $z &amp;lt; 0.83$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to qualify its performance.</description>

      <description>First author: D. Aguado
HE 0107$-$5240 is a hyper metal-poor star with $\rm [Fe/H]=-5.39$. We performed high-res observations with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the VLT to constrain the kinematical properties of the binary system HE 0107$-$5240 and to probe the binarity of the sample of 8 most metal-poor stars with $\rm [Fe/H]&amp;lt;-4.5$. Radial velocities are obtained by using cross-correlation in the interval 4200$-$4315A, which contains the strong CH band, against a template in an iterative process.</description>

Context. Radiative losses are an indispensable part in the numerical simulation of flares. Detailed calculations could be computationally expensive, especially in the chromosphere. There have been some approximate recipes for chromospheric radiative losses in flares, yet their feasibility in flare simulations needs further evaluation. Aims. We aim to evaluate the performance of different recipes for chromospheric radiative losses in flare simulations. Methods. We compare the atmospheric structure and line profiles in beam-heated flares calculated with detailed radiative losses and the approximate recipes.</description>

We aim to compare variations in the full-UV dust extinction curve (912-3000 Angstrom), with the HI/H$_2$/total H content along diffuse Milky Way sightlines, to investigate possible connections between ISM conditions and dust properties. We combine an existing sample of 75 UV extinction curves based on IUE and FUSE data, with atomic and molecular column densities measured through UV absorption. The H$_2$ column density data are based on existing Lyman-Werner absorption band models from earlier work on the extinction curves.</description>

      <description>First author: Shuo Kong
A collision-induced magnetic reconnection (CMR) mechanism was recently proposed to explain the formation of a filament in the Orion A molecular cloud. In this mechanism, a collision between two clouds with antiparallel magnetic fields produces a dense filament due to the magnetic tension of the reconnected fields. The filament contains fiber-like sub-structures and is confined by a helical magnetic field. To show whether the dense filament is capable of forming stars, we use the \textsc{Arepo} code with sink particles to model star formation following the formation of the CMR-filament.</description>

Statistical analyses of the measurements of the Hubble-Lema^itre constant $H_0$ (163 measurements between 1976 and 2019) show that the statistical error bars associated with the observed parameter measurements have been underestimated &amp;ndash; or the systematic errors were not properly taken into account &amp;ndash; in at least 15-20% of the measurements. The fact that the underestimation of error bars for $H_0$ is so common might explain the apparent discrepancy of values, which is formally known today as the Hubble tension.</description>

Both the origin of, and the population demographics of, massive black holes (MBHs) remains an open question in modern day astrophysics. Here we introduce the BlackDemon suite of cosmological simulations using the Enzo code. The suite consists of three, high resolution, distinct regions, each with a side length of 1 $\rm{h}^{-1}$ Mpc, evolving within a larger overdense region. The simulation suite has spatial and mass resolution capable of resolving the formation of the first galaxies and MBHs within each region.</description>

We measure the $M_{\rm HI}-M_{\star}$ relation over the last billion years down to $M_{\rm HI}\sim 10^7 M_{\odot}$ using the MIGHTEE Early Science data with a Bayesian technique. This technique is applied to the HI detections, without binning the datasets, while taking account of the intrinsic scatter in the $M_{\rm HI}-M_{\star}$ relation. We divide the full sample of 249 galaxies into 161 spirals, 64 irregulars, 15 mergers, and 9 elliptical galaxies to measure their $M_{\rm HI}-M_{\star}$ relations.</description>

We found strong variability of source emission in all the considered bands, especially in the $\gamma$-ray band it exhibited extreme outbursts when the flux crossed the level of $10^{-5}:{\rm photon:cm^{-2}:s^{-1}}$.</description>

Upcoming large-scale-structure surveys can shed new light on the properties of dark energy. In particular, if dark energy is a dynamical component, it must have spatial perturbations. Their behaviour is regulated by the speed of sound parameter, which is currently unconstrained. In this work we present the numerical methods that will allow to perform cosmological simulations of inhomogeneous dark energy scenarios where the speed of sound is small and non-vanishing.</description>

Herschel studies suggest that nearby (d &amp;lt; 500 pc) molecular filaments have a typical half-power width ~0.1pc, but this finding has been questioned on the ground that the measured widths tend to increase with distance. Here we revisit the dependence of measured filament widths on distance or equivalently spatial resolution, in an effort to determine whether nearby molecular filaments have a characteristic half-power width or whether this is an artifact of the finite resolution of the Herschel data.</description>

Magnetized radio filaments are found in abundance in the inner few hundred pc of our Galaxy. Progress in understanding this population of filaments has been slow, in part due to a lack of detection elsewhere in the Galaxy or in external galaxies. Recent highly sensitive radio continuum observations of radio galaxies in galaxy clusters have revealed remarkable isolated filamentary structures in the ICM that are linked to radio jets, tails and lobes.</description>

We propose a novel method to examine whether Galactic double neutron star binaries are formed in the LISA band. In our method, we assign an effective time fraction $\tau$ to each double neutron star binary detected by LISA. This fraction is given as a function of the observed orbital period and eccentricity and should be uniformly distributed in the absence of in-band binary formation. Applying statistical techniques such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to the actual list of $\tau$, we can inspect the signature of the in-band binary formation.</description>

Fast radio bursts are millisecond-duration pulses of radio emission that have been found to originate at extragalactic distances. The bursts show dispersion imparted by intervening plasma, with the bulk attributed to the intergalactic medium. Here we report the discovery of a burst, FRB20220610A, in a complex host galaxy system at a redshift of $z=1.016 \pm 0.002$. The relationship between its redshift and dispersion confirm that the bulk of the baryonic matter was ionized and in the intergalactic medium when the universe was almost half its present age.</description>

The recent detection of a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) in an old globular cluster in M81 challenges traditional FRB formation mechanisms based on magnetic activity in young neutron stars formed recently in core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore, the detection of this repeater in such a nearby galaxy implies a high local universe rate of similar events in globular clusters. Building off the properties inferred from the M81 FRB, we predict the number of FRB sources in nearby ($d \lesssim 20,$Mpc) galaxies with large globular cluster systems known.</description>

Antimatter cosmic-rays are used to probe new phenomena in physics, including dark matter annihilation. We use the cosmic-ray positron fraction spectrum by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, to search for such an annihilation signal in the Galaxy. We focus on dark matter with mass between 5 and 120 GeV, producing high-energy electrons and positrons. In these cosmic-ray energies the interplay of multiple astrophysical sources and phenomena, makes this search highly sensitive to the underlying astrophysical background assumptions.</description>

The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, NASA&amp;rsquo;s next flagship observatory, will redefine deep-field galaxy survey with a field of view two orders of magnitude larger than Hubble and an angular resolution of matching quality. These future deep-wide galaxy surveys necessitate new simulations to forecast their scientific output and to optimise survey strategies.

In this work, we measure the cross-section of single event upset (SEU) of the shift register on XRPIX by irradiating heavy ion beams with linear energy transfer (LET) ranging from 0.022 MeV/(mg/cm2) to 68 MeV/(mg/cm2). From the SEU cross-section curve, the saturation cross-section and threshold LET are successfully obtained to be $3.</description>

To investigate the star formation process, we present a multi-wavelength study of a massive star-forming site RAFGL 5085, which has been associated with the molecular outflow, HII region, and near-infrared cluster. The continuum images at 12, 250, 350, and 500 $\mu$m show a central region (having M${\rm clump}$ $\sim$225 M${\odot}$) surrounded by five parsec-scale filaments, revealing a hub-filament system (HFS). In the {\it Herschel} column density ($N({{\rm{H}}}{2})$) map, filaments are identified with higher aspect ratios (length/diameter) and lower $N({{\rm{H}}}{2})$ values ($\sim$0.</description>

      <description>First author: Floor van Donkelaar
The formation history of globular clusters (GCs) at redshift $z &amp;gt; 4$ remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we use the cosmological, $N$-body hydrodynamical ``zoom-in&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; simulation GigaEris to study the properties and formation of proto-GC candidates in the region surrounding the progenitor of a Milky Way-sized galaxy. The simulation employs a modern implementation of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, including metal-line cooling and metal and thermal diffusion and allows to resolve systems at the scale of star clusters.</description>

Red supergiants (RSGs) are evolved massive stars in a stage preceding core-collapse supernova. Understanding evolved-phases of these cool stars is key to understanding the cosmic matter cycle of our Universe, since they enrich the cosmos with newly formed elements. However, the physical processes that trigger mass loss in their atmospheres are still not fully understood, and remain one of the key questions in stellar astrophysics. We use a new method to study the extended atmospheres of these cold stars, exploring the effect of a stellar wind for both a simple radiative equilibrium model and a semi-empirical model that accounts for a chromospheric temperature structure.</description>

The Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) is a large public spectroscopic survey that was carried out using the multi-object FLAMES spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. The survey provides accurate radial velocities, stellar parameters, and elemental abundances for ~115,000 stars in all Milky Way components. In this paper we describe the method adopted in the final data release to derive lithium equivalent widths (EWs) and abundances. Lithium EWs were measured using two different approaches for FGK and M-type stars, to account for the intrinsic differences in the spectra.</description>

Phosphorus (P) is considered to be one of the key elements for life, making it an important element to look for in the abundance analysis of spectra of stellar systems. Yet, there exists only a handful of spectroscopic studies to estimate the P abundances and investigate its trend across a range of metallicities. We have observed full HK band spectra at a spectral resolving power of R=45,000 with IGRINS instrument.</description>

Several bright and massive galaxy candidates at high redshifts have been recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. Such early massive galaxies seem difficult to reconcile with standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model predictions. We discuss under which circumstances such observed massive galaxy candidates can be explained by introducing primordial non-Gaussianity in the initial conditions of the cosmological perturbations.

We present the first systematic follow-up of Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) selected candidates down to signal-to-noise (S/N) of 3 over the 5000 deg$^2$ covered by the Dark Energy Survey. Using the MCMF cluster confirmation algorithm, we identify optical counterparts, determine photometric redshifts and richnesses and assign a parameter, $f_{\rm cont}$, that reflects the probability that each SZE-optical pairing represents a real cluster rather than a random superposition of physically unassociated systems.</description>

We model the spectrum from 4.9 - 28 $\mu$m to extract Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and the underlying obscured continuum. We find that the NE nucleus (A) is highly obscured where the low PAH equivalent width (EW) ratio, EW(12.</description>

Compact Obscured Nuclei (CONs) account for a significant fraction of the population of luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs). These galaxy nuclei are compact, with radii of 10-100~pc, with large optical depths at submm and far-infrared wavelengths, and characterized by vibrationally excited HCN emission. It is not known what powers the large luminosities of the CON host galaxies because of the extreme optical depths towards their nuclei.</description>

We describe a new transit detection algorithm designed to detect single transit events in discontinuous Perkins INfrared Exosatellite Survey (PINES) observations of L and T dwarfs. We use this algorithm to search for transits in 131 PINES light curves and identify two transit candidates: 2MASS J18212815+1414010 (2MASS J1821+1414) and 2MASS J08350622+1953050 (2MASS J0835+1953). We disfavor 2MASS J1821+1414 as a genuine transit candidate due to the known variability properties of the source.</description>

The globular cluster (GC) candidate selection is based on the ($u^*$ - $i^\prime$) versus ($i^\prime$ - $K_s$) color-color diagram, and $i^\prime$-band shape parameters.</description>

Magnetic fields grow quickly, even at early cosmological times, suggesting the action of a small-scale dynamo (SSD) in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. Many studies have focused on idealized, isotropic, homogeneous, turbulent driving of the SSD. Here we analyze more realistic simulations of supernova-driven turbulence to understand how it drives an SSD. We find that SSD growth rates are intermittently variable as a result of the evolving multiphase ISM structure.</description>

The gravitational collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars can lead to the onset of the low $T/|W|$ instability within the central proto-neutron star (PNS), which leaves strong signatures in both the gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino emission. Strong large-scale magnetic fields are usually invoked to explain outstanding stellar explosions of rapidly rotating progenitors, but their impact on the growth of such instability has not yet been cleared.</description>

Primordial black holes (PBHs) form from large-amplitude initial density fluctuations and may comprise some or all of the dark matter. If PBHs have an extended mass spectrum, or in mixed PBH-particle dark matter scenarios, the extreme density fluctuations necessary to produce PBHs also lead to the formation of a much greater abundance of dark matter minihaloes with internal densities potentially of order $10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-3}$.</description>

We present here a simple hydrodynamic model based on a sequence of steady states of the inner sub-Keplerian accretion disc to model its spectral states. Correlations between different hydrodynamic steady states are studied with a goal to understand the origin of, e.g., the aperiodic variabilities. The plausible source of corona/outflow close to the central compact object is shown to be a consequence of steady state transition in the underlying accretion flow.</description>

Global 21cm cosmology aims to investigate the cosmic dawn and epoch of reionisation by measuring the sky averaged HI absorption signal, which requires, accurate modelling of, or correction for, the bright radio foregrounds and distortions arising from chromaticity of the antenna beam. We investigate the effect of improving foreground modelling by fitting data sets from many observation times simultaneously in a single Bayesian analysis, fitting for the same parameter set by performing these fits on simulated data.</description>

We present a three-dimensional (3-D) visualization of jet geometry using numerical methods based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) optimized algorithm. Our aim is to visualize the 3-D geometry of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet using observations, which are inherently two-dimensional (2-D) images. Many AGN jets display complex structures that include hotspots and bends. The structure of these bends in the jet&amp;rsquo;s frame may appear quite different than what we see in the sky frame, where it is transformed by our particular viewing geometry.</description>

In CARTOON, the frequency-integrated general relativistic radiative transfer equation is solved in a photon number-conserving manner, and the isotropic and coherent scattering in the zero angular momentum observers (ZAMO) frame and the fluid rest frame is incorporated.</description>

A thermal component is suggested to be the physical composition of the ejecta of several bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Such a thermal component is discovered in the time-integrated spectra of several short GRBs as well as long GRBs. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of ten very short GRBs detected by Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor to search for the thermal component. We found that both the resultant low-energy spectral index and the peak energy in each GRB imply a common hard spectral feature, which is in favor of the main classification of the short/hard versus long/soft dichotomy in the GRB duration.</description>

In over a thousand known cataclysmic variables (CVs), where a white dwarf is accreting from a hydrogen-rich star, only a dozen have orbital periods below 75 minutes. One way to achieve these short periods requires the donor star to have undergone substantial nuclear evolution prior to interacting with the white dwarf, and it is expected that these objects will transition to helium accretion. These transitional CVs have been proposed as progenitors of helium CVs.</description>

As part of the GLOSTAR survey we have used the VLA in its B-configuration to observe the part of the Galactic plane between longitudes of 28d and 36d and latitudes from -1d to +1d at the C-band (4&amp;ndash;8 GHz). To reduce the contamination of extended sources that are not well recovered by our coverage of the (u, v)-plane we discarded short baselines that are sensitive to emission on angular scales $&amp;lt;4&amp;quot;$.</description>

      <description>First author: Antoine Grandjean
The Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) young and nearby massive star-forming region is particularly well suited for extrasolar planet searches with both direct imaging and radial velocity (RV) techniques. The RV search, however, is challenging, as the stars are faster rotators on average than their older stellar counterparts of similar spectral types. Moreover, the RV time series show strong signatures of stellar variability (spots and faculae) and/or stellar pulsations.</description>

Extended and delayed emission around distant TeV sources induced by the effects of propagation of gamma rays through the intergalactic medium can be used for the measurement of the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). We search for delayed GeV emission from the hard-spectrum TeV blazar 1ES 0229+200 with the goal to detect or constrain the IGMF-dependent secondary flux generated during the propagation of TeV gamma rays through the intergalactic medium.</description>

The absolute position of Sgr A*, the compact radio source at the center of the Milky Way, had been uncertain by several tens of milliarcseconds. Here we report improved astrometric measurements of the absolute position and proper motion of Sgr A*. Three epochs of phase-referencing observations were conducted with the VLBA for Sgr A* at 22 and 43 GHz in 2019 and 2020. Using extragalactic radio sources with sub-milliarcsecond accurate positions as reference, we determined the absolute position of Sgr A* at a reference epoch 2020.</description>

Various bright structures abound in the chromosphere playing an essential role in the dynamics and evolution therein. Tentatively identifying the wave characteristics in the outer solar atmosphere helps to understand this layer better. One of the most significant aspects of these characteristics is the wave phase speed (PS), which is a dominant contribution to solar coronal heating and Energy distribution in the Sun&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere layers. To obtain energy flux (EF), it is necessary to calculate the filling factor (FF) and the PS.</description>

There is a very popular two-zone accretion disk model that the inner part of the non-advective Keplerian disk (Shakura-Sunyaev disk) can produce hot advection-dominated accretion flow, which can generate high energy power-law radiation and outflows/jets. However, we find that this simple model is inadequate to automatically explain many properties of the sources (such as hysteresis effect, counter-clockwise traversal in a hardness-intensity diagram, peculiar variabilities, and association/non-association of jets in a black hole $X-$ray binary) without considering additional assumptions.</description>

The fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) are a new population of extragalactic transients of unclear physical origin. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed including failed supernova explosion, shock interaction with a dense medium, young magnetar, accretion onto a compact object, and stellar tidal disruption event, but none is conclusive. Here we report the discovery of a possible X-ray quasi-periodicity signal with a period of $\sim$250 second (at a significance level of 99.</description>

The launch of NuSTAR and the increasing number of binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected through gravitational wave (GW) observations have exponentially advanced our understanding of black holes. Despite the simplicity owed to being fully described by their mass and angular momentum, black holes have remained mysterious laboratories that probe the most extreme environments in the Universe. While significant progress has been made in the recent decade, the distribution of spin in black holes has not yet been understood.</description>

Halo abundance and structures are critical to understand the small scale challenges for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We present a unified theory and analytical models for both halo mass function and halo density profile based on a random walk of halos and dark matter particles. The position dependent waiting time in random walk leads to a stretched Gaussian for mass function and density with a power-law on small scale and an exponential decay on large scale.</description>

      <description>First author: Sayan Kundu
This work investigates the evolution of the distribution of charged particles (cosmic rays) due to the mechanism of stochastic turbulent acceleration (STA) in presence of small-scale turbulence with a mean magnetic field. STA is usually modelled as a biased random walk process in the momentum space of the non-thermal particles. This results in an advection-diffusion type transport equation for the non-thermal particle distribution function. Under quasilinear approximation, and by assuming a turbulent spectrum with single scale injection at sub-gyroscale, we find that the Fokker-Planck diffusion coefficients $D_{\gamma\gamma}$ and $D_{\mu\mu}$ scale with the Lorentz factor $\gamma$ as: $D_{\gamma\gamma}\propto\gamma^{-2/3}$ and $D_{\mu\mu}\propto\gamma^{-8/3}$.</description>

Nulling interferometry is one of the most promising technologies for imaging exoplanets within stellar habitable zones. The use of photonics for carrying out nulling interferometry enables the contrast and separation required for exoplanet detection. So far, two key issues limiting current-generation photonic nullers have been identified: phase variations and chromaticity within the beam combiner. The use of tricouplers addresses both limitations, delivering a broadband, achromatic null together with phase measurements for fringe tracking.</description>

Titan&amp;rsquo;s northern high latitudes host many large hydrocarbon lakes. Like water lakes on Earth, Titan&amp;rsquo;s lakes are constantly subject to evaporation. This process strongly affects the atmospheric methane abundance, the atmospheric temperature, the lake mixed layer temperature, and the local wind circulation. In this work we use a 2D atmospheric mesoscale model coupled to a slab lake model to investigate the effect of solar and infrared radiation on the exchange of energy and methane between Titan&amp;rsquo;s lakes and atmosphere.</description>

The nature of the newly discovered fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) is still puzzling astronomers. In this paper we carry out a comprehensive analysis of the molecular gas, ionized gas and stellar populations in the environment of the nearby FBOT AT2018cow based on ALMA, VLT/MUSE and HST/WFC3 observations. A prominent molecular concentration of 6 ($\pm$ 1) $\times$ 10$^6$ $M_\odot$ is found in the vicinity of AT2018cow, which has given rise to two active star-forming complexes with ages of 4 $\pm$ 1 Myr and $\lesssim$2.</description>

Comparison of echelle spectra to synthetic models has become a computational statistics challenge, with over ten thousand individual spectral lines affecting a typical cool star echelle spectrum. Telluric artifacts, imperfect line lists, inexact continuum placement, and inflexible models frustrate the scientific promise of these information-rich datasets. Here we debut an interpretable machine-learning framework &amp;ldquo;blas&#39;e&amp;rdquo; that addresses these and other challenges. The semi-empirical approach can be viewed as &amp;ldquo;transfer learning&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; first pre-training models on noise-free precomputed synthetic spectral models, then learning the corrections to line depths and widths from whole-spectrum fitting to an observed spectrum.</description>

      <description>First author: Benson T. Guest
We present a third epoch of Chandra observations of the Type Ia Large Magellanic Cloud Supernova remnant (SNR) 0509-67.5. With these new observations from 2020, the baseline for proper motion measurements of the expansion has grown to 20 years (from the earliest Chandra observations in 2000). We report here the results of these new expansion measurements. The lack of nearby bright point sources renders absolute image alignment difficult.</description>

The Galactic bulge at latitude $4&amp;lt;|b|$(deg.)$&amp;lt;10$ was claimed to show an X-shape, which means that stellar density distributions along the line of sight have a double peak. However, this double peak is only observed with the red-clump population, and doubt has been cast on its use as a perfect standard candle.\ As such, a boxy bulge without an X-shape is not discarded. We aim to constrain the shape of the bulge making use of a different population: Mira variables from the new Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment data release, OGLE-IV, with an average age of 9 Gyr.</description>

      <description>First author: Miquel Miravet-Tenés
Insufficient numerical resolution of grid-based, direct numerical simulations (DNS) hampers the development of instabilitydriven turbulence at small (unresolved) scales. As an alternative to DNS, sub-grid models can potentially reproduce the effects of turbulence at small scales in terms of the resolved scales, and hence can capture physical effects with less computational resources. We present a new sub-grid model, the MHD-instability-induced-turbulence (MInIT) mean-field model. MInIT is a physically motivated model based on the evolution of the turbulent (Maxwell, Reynolds, and Faraday) stress tensors and their relation with the turbulent energy densities of the magneto-rotational (MRI) and parasitic instabilities, modeled with two partial differential evolution equations with stiff source terms.</description>

Families of asteroids generated by the collisional fragmentation of a common parent body have been identified using clustering methods of asteroids in their proper orbital element space. An alternative method has been developed in order to identify collisional families from the correlation between the asteroid fragment sizes and their proper semi-major axis distance from the family centre (V-shape). This method has been shown to be effective in the cases of the very diffuse families that formed billions of years ago.</description>

This paper introduces the emerging field of astrobotics, that is, a recently-established branch of robotics to be of service to astrophysics and observational astronomy. We first describe a modern requirement of dark matter studies, i.e., the generation of the map of the observable universe, using astrobots. Astrobots differ from conventional two-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulators in two respects. First, the dense formation of astrobots give rise to the extremely overlapping dynamics of neighboring astrobots which make them severely subject to collisions.</description>

Recent studies illustrate the correlation between the angular momenta of cosmic structures and their Lagrangian properties. However, only baryons are observable and it is unclear whether they reliably trace the cosmic angular momenta. We study the Lagrangian mass distribution, spin correlation and predictability of dark matter, gas, and stellar components of galaxy-halo systems using IllustrisTNG, and show that the primordial segregations between components are typically small.</description>

We present BIFROST, an extended version of the GPU-accelerated hierarchical fourth-order forward symplectic integrator code FROST. BIFROST (BInaries in FROST) can efficiently evolve collisional stellar systems with arbitrary binary fractions up to $f_\mathrm{bin}=100%$ by using secular and regularised integration for binaries, triples, multiple systems or small clusters around black holes within the fourth-order forward integrator framework. Post-Newtonian (PN) terms up to order PN3.5 are included in the equations of motion of compact subsystems with optional three-body and spin-dependent terms.</description>

The scaling of the specific Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate with host galaxy stellar mass $\dot{N}\text{Ia} / M\star \sim M_\star^{-0.3}$ as measured in ASAS-SN and DES strongly suggests that the number of SNe Ia produced by a stellar population depends inversely on its metallicity. We estimate the strength of the required metallicity dependence by combining the average star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass with the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for galaxies and common parametrizations for the SN Ia delay-time distribution.</description>

We investigate the formation of Milky-Way-mass galaxies using FIRE-2 LCDM cosmological zoom-in simulations by studying the orbital evolution of stars formed in the main progenitor of the galaxy, from birth to the present day. We classify in situ stars as isotropic spheroid, thick-disc, and thin-disc according to their orbital circularities and show that these components are assembled in a time-ordered sequence from early to late times, respectively.</description>

Globular clusters (GCs) are excellent tracers of the formation and early evolution of the Milky Way. The bulge GCs (BGCs) are particularly important because they can reveal vital information about the oldest, in-situ component of the Milky Way. We aim at deriving mean metallicities and radial velocities for 13 GCs that lie towards the bulge and are generally associated with this component. We use near infrared low resolution spectroscopy with the FORS2 instrument on the VLT to measure the wavelengths and equivalent widths of the CaII triplet (CaT) lines for a number of stars per cluster.</description>

Establishing the period&amp;ndash;Wesenheit relation requires independent and accurate distance measurements of classical Cepheids (DCEPs). The precise distance provided by an associated open cluster independently calibrates the period&amp;ndash;Wesenheit relation of DCEPs. 51 DCEPs associated with open clusters are compiled using the constraints of five-dimensional astrometric information. By directly using Gaia DR3 parallax, the period&amp;ndash;Wesenheit relation in the Gaia $G$ band is calibrated as $W_G = (-3.06 \pm 0.</description>

New functionality to process Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data has been implemented in the CASA package. This includes two new tasks to handle fringe fitting and VLBI-specific amplitude calibration steps. Existing tasks have been adjusted to handle VLBI visibility data and calibration meta-data properly. With these updates, it is now possible to process VLBI continuum and spectral line observations in CASA. This article describes the development and implementation, and presents an outline for the workflow when calibrating European VLBI Network or Very Long Baseline Array data in CASA.</description>

CASA, the Common Astronomy Software Applications, is the primary data processing software for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and is frequently used also for other radio telescopes. The CASA software can handle data from single-dish, aperture-synthesis, and Very Long Baseline Interferometery (VLBI) telescopes. One of its core functionalities is to support the calibration and imaging pipelines for ALMA, VLA, VLA Sky Survey (VLASS), and the Nobeyama 45m telescope.</description>

      <description>First author: Maxim Lyutikov
We reconsider the dynamics of accretion flows onto magnetized central star. For dipolar magnetically aligned case, the centrifugal barrier is at $R_{cb} = (2/3)^{1/3} R_c = 0.87 R_c$, where $R_c= ( G M/\Omega^2)^{1/3}$ is the corotation radius. For oblique dipole direct accretion from the corotation radius $R_c$ is possible only for magnetic obliquity satisfying $\tan \theta_\mu \geq 1/( 2 \sqrt{3}) $ ($\theta_\mu \geq 16.1^\circ $). The accretion proceeds in a form of funnel flows - along two streams centered on the $\mu-\Omega$ plane, with azimuthal opening angle $ \cos (\Delta \phi) = { \cot^ 2 {\theta_\mu} }/{12} $.</description>

We present novel techniques and methodology for unresolved photometric characterization of low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. With the Pomenis LEO Satellite Photometric Survey our team has made over 14,000 observations of Starlink and OneWeb satellites to measure their apparent brightness. From the apparent brightness of each satellite, we calculate a new metric: the effective albedo, which quantifies the specularity of the reflecting satellite. Unlike stellar magnitude units, the effective albedo accounts for apparent range and phase angle and enables direct comparison of different satellites.</description>

The spatial distribution of CN 2-1 and CS 5-4 are generally consistent with each other, as well as HCN 1-0 in literature. However, different line ratios of CS 5-4 and CN 2-1 are found in A, B, and C regions, with highest value in B.</description>

Cycling of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and interior of rocky planets can stabilize global climate and enable planetary surface temperatures above freezing over geologic time. However, variations in global carbon budget and unstable feedback cycles between planetary sub-systems may destabilize the climate of rocky exoplanets toward regimes unknown in the Solar System. Here, we perform clear-sky atmospheric radiative transfer and surface weathering simulations to probe the stability of climate equilibria for rocky, ocean-bearing exoplanets at instellations relevant for planetary systems in the outer regions of the circumstellar habitable zone.</description>

The cocoon is an inevitable product of a jet propagating through ambient matter, and takes a fair fraction of the jet energy. In short gamma-ray bursts, the ambient matter is the ejecta from the merger of neutron stars, expanding with a high velocity $\sim 0.2 c$, in contrast to the static stellar envelope in collapsars. Using 2D relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with the ejecta density profile as $\rho \propto r^{-2}$, we find that the expansion makes a big difference; only 0.</description>

The cocoon is heated by a \textit{short} gamma-ray burst (\textit{s}GRB) jet propagating through the ejecta of a Neutron Star (NS) merger, and a part of the cocoon escapes the ejecta with an opening angle of $20^{\circ}$&amp;ndash;$30^{\circ}$.

The pairwise collisional growth of dust aggregates consisting submicron-sized grains is the first step of the planet formation, and understanding the collisional behavior of dust aggregates is therefore essential. It is known that the main energy dissipation mechanisms are the tangential frictions between particles in contact, namely, rolling, sliding, and twisting. However, there is a large uncertainty for the strength of rolling friction, and the dependence of the collisional growth condition on the strength of rolling friction was poorly understood.</description>

The properties of 67P/CG nucleus are discussed and compared with other comets explored in the past by space missions. Cometary nuclei are made by a collection of ices, minerals, organic matter, and salts resulting in very dark and red-colored surfaces. When far from the Sun, exposed water and carbon dioxide ices are found only in few locations of 67P/CG where the exposure of pristine subsurface layers or the recondensation of volatile species driven by the solar heating and local terrain morphology can sustain their temporary presence on the surface.</description>

For the needed priors, I have collected 171 distances based on old methods (including expansion parallaxes and extinction distances). Further, I have collected the V-magnitudes at peak and the extinction measures, so as to produce absolute magnitudes at peak and then derive a crude distance as a prior.</description>

A variety of new physical processes have proven to play an important role in orbital decay of a satellite galaxy embedded inside a dark matter halo but this is not fully understood. Our goal is to assess if the orbital history of a satellite remains unchanged during a concurrent sinking. For this purpose we analyze the impact that the internal structure of the satellites and their spatial distribution inside the host halo may have on the concurrent sinking process due to both mass loss and the combined effect of self-friction, which have not been studied before for concurrent sinking.</description>

Moons orbiting rocky exoplanets in compact orbits about other stars experience an accelerated tidal evolution, and can either merge with their parent planet or reach the limit of dynamical instability within a Hubble time. We review the parameter space over which moons become unbound, including the effects of atmospheric tides on the planetary spin. We find that such tides can change the final outcome from merger to escape, albeit over a limited parameter space.</description>

This process emits scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW) that behaves like an extra radiation component and contributes to the relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm{eff}}$). We show that $N_{\rm{eff}}$ limits from cosmic microwave background (CMB) give promising sensitivities on both the abundance of PBHs and the primordial curvature perturbation ($\mathcal{P}{\mathcal{R}}(k)$) at small scales.</description>

We observed the periodic radio transient GLEAM-X J162759.5-523504.3 (GLEAM-X J1627) using the Chandra X-ray Observatory for about 30-ks on January 22-23, 2022, simultaneously with radio observations from MWA, MeerKAT and ATCA. Its radio emission and 18-min periodicity led the source to be tentatively interpreted as an extreme magnetar or a peculiar highly magnetic white dwarf. The source was not detected in the 0.3-8 keV energy range with a 3-sigma upper-limit on the count rate of 3x10^{-4} counts/s.</description>

Composed of ultralight bosons, fuzzy dark matter provides an intriguing solution to challenges that the standard cold dark matter model encounters on sub-galactic scales. The ultralight dark matter with mass $m\sim10^{-23} \rm{eV}$ will induce a periodic oscillation in gravitational potentials with a frequency in the nanohertz band, leading to observable effects in the arrival times of radio pulses from pulsars. Unlike scalar dark matter, pulsar timing signals induced by the vector dark matter are dependent on the oscillation direction of the vector fields.</description>

We investigate the potential of using a sample of very high-redshift ($2\lesssim z \lesssim6$) (VHZ) Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) attainable by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) on constraining cosmological parameters. At such high redshifts, the age of the universe is young enough that the VHZ SNIa sample comprises the very first SNe~Ia of the universe, with progenitors among the very first generation of low mass stars that the universe has made.</description>

The observational data of primordial black holes and scalar-induced gravitational waves can constrain the primordial curvature perturbation at small scales. We parameterize the primordial curvature perturbation by a broken power law form and find that it is consistent with many inflation models that can produce primordial black holes, such as nonminimal derivative coupling inflation, scalar-tensor inflation, Gauss-Bonnet inflation, and K/G inflation. The constraints from primordial black holes on the primordial curvature power spectrum with the broken power law form are obtained, where the fraction of primordial black holes in dark matter is calculated by the peak theory.</description>

      <description>First author: Fiona McCarthy
Local non-Gaussianities in the initial conditions of the Universe, parameterized by $f_{\rm NL}$, induce a scale-dependence in the large-scale bias of halos in the late Universe. This effect is a promising path to constrain multi-field inflation theories that predict non-zero $f_{\rm NL}$. While most existing constraints from the halo bias involve auto-correlations of the galaxy distribution, cross-correlations with probes of the matter density provide an alternative channel with fewer systematics.</description>

Early dark energy models have attracted attention in the context of the recent problem of the Hubble tension. Here we extend these models by taking into account the new density fluctuations generated by the dark energy decays around the recombination phase. We solve the evolution of the density perturbations in dark energy fluid generated at the phase transition of early dark energy as isocurvature perturbations. Assuming that the isocurvature mode is characterized by a power-law power spectrum and is uncorrelated with the standard adiabatic mode, we calculate the CMB angular power spectra and compare them to the Planck data using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method.</description>

Exa-scale simulations are on the horizon but almost no new design for the output has been proposed in recent years. In simulations using individual time steps, the traditional snapshots are over resolving particles/cells with large time steps and are under resolving the particles/cells with short time steps. Therefore, they are unable to follow fast events and use efficiently the storage space. The Continuous Simulation Data Stream (CSDS) is designed to decrease this space while providing an accurate state of the simulation at any time.</description>

      <description>First author: Federico G. Iza
We use the 30 simulations of the Auriga Project to estimate the temporal dependency of the inflow, outflow and net accretion rates onto the discs of Milky Way-like galaxies. The net accretion rates are found to be similar for all galaxies at early times, increasing rapidly up to $\sim 10~\mathrm{M}\odot , \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. After $\sim 6~\mathrm{Gyr}$ of evolution, however, the net accretion rates are diverse: in most galaxies, these exhibit an exponential-like decay, but some systems instead present increasing or approximately constant levels up to the present time.</description>

The cuspy central density profiles of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes make them highly resilient to disruption by tides. Self-interactions between dark matter particles, or the cycling of baryons during galaxy formation, may result in the formation of a constant density core which would make haloes more susceptible to tidal disruption. We use N-body simulations to study the evolution of NFW-like &amp;ldquo;cored&amp;rdquo; subhaloes in the tidal field of a massive host, and identify the criteria and timescales for full tidal disruption.</description>

We present a detailed analysis of the protostellar outflow activity in the massive star-forming region NGC 3324, as revealed by new Early Release Observations (ERO) from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Emission from numerous outflows is revealed in narrow-band images of hydrogen Paschen-$\alpha$ (Pa-$\alpha$) and molecular hydrogen. In particular, we report the discovery of 24 previously unknown outflows based on their H$_2$ emission. We find three candidate driving sources for these H$_2$ flows in published catalogs of young stellar objects (YSOs) and we identify 15 IR point sources in the new JWST images as potential driving protostars.</description>

The cosmic distance duality relation (DDR) is constrained from the combination of type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems using deep learning method. To make use of the full SGL data, we reconstruct the luminosity distance from SNe Ia up to the highest redshift of SGL using deep learning, then it is compared with the angular diameter distance obtained from SGL. Considering the influence of lens mass profile, we constrain the possible violation of DDR in three lens mass models.</description>

These quasars have well quantified selection functions and nearly one third of them also have virial BH masses estimated from near-IR spectroscopy. We use forward modeling of parameterized intrinsic distributions of BH masses and Eddington ratios, and account for the sample flux limits and measurement uncertainties of the BH masses and luminosities.</description>

The set of molecules studied include CO isotopologues in various transitions, HCN, CN, H2CO, HCO+, C2H and c-C3H2. The vertical emitting region is determined directly from the channel maps, implementing accurate masking of the channel emission to recover the vertical location of the emission surface even at large radial distances from the star and for low-SNR lines.</description>

Quasar absorption line analysis is critical for studying gas and dust components and their physical and chemical properties as well as the evolution and formation of galaxies in the early universe. Ca II absorbers, which are one of the dustiest absorbers and are located at lower redshifts than most other absorbers, are especially valuable when studying physical processes and conditions in recent galaxies. However, the number of known quasar Ca II absorbers is relatively low due to the difficulty of detecting them with traditional methods.</description>

High redshift quasars ($z&amp;gt;5$) that also shine brightly at radio wavelengths are unique signposts of supermassive black hole activity in the early universe. However, bright radio sources at $z\ge5$ are extremely rare and therefore we have started a campaign to search for new high-$z$ quasars by combining an optical dropout selection driven by the $g$, $r$, and $z$ bands from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys with low-frequency radio observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS).</description>

Luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) such as AT2018cow form a rare class of engine-powered explosions of uncertain origin. A hallmark feature of these events is radio/millimeter synchrotron emission powered by the interaction of fast (v &amp;gt; 0.1 c) ejecta and dense circumstellar material (CSM) extending to large radii &amp;gt; 1e16 cm surrounding the progenitor. Assuming this CSM to be an outflow from the progenitor, we show that dust grains up to ~1 micron in size can form in the outflow in the years before the explosion.</description>

A big question in the field of star and planet formation is the time at which substantial dust grain growth occurs. The observed properties of dust emission across different wavelength ranges have been used as an indication that millimeter-sized grains are already present in the envelopes of young protostars. However, this interpretation is in tension with results from coagulation simulations, which are not able to produce such large grains in these conditions.</description>

We use the kinematic data of the stars in eight dwarf spheroidal galaxies to assess whether $f(R)$ gravity can fit the observed profiles of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of these systems without resorting to dark matter. Our model assumes that each galaxy is spherically symmetric and has a constant velocity anisotropy parameter $\beta$ and constant mass-to-light ratio consistent with stellar population synthesis models. We solve the spherical Jeans equation that includes the Yukawa-like gravitational potential appearing in the weak field limit of $f(R)$ gravity, and a Plummer density profile for the stellar distribution.</description>

Many gravitational wave (GW) sources in the LISA band are expected to have non-negligible eccentricity. Furthermore, many of them can undergo acceleration because they reside in the presence of a tertiary. Here we develop analytical and numerical methods to quantify how the compact binary&amp;rsquo;s eccentricity enhances the detection of its peculiar acceleration. We show that the general relativistic precession pattern can disentangle the binary&amp;rsquo;s acceleration-induced frequency shift from the chirp-mass-induced frequency shift in GW template fitting, thus relaxing the signal-to-noise ratio requirement for distinguishing the acceleration by a factor of $10\sim100$.</description>

      <description>First author: Tianshu Wang
The two-moment method is widely used to approximate the full neutrino transport equation in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations, and different closures lead to subtle differences in the simulation results. In this paper, we compare the effects of closure choices on various physical quantities in 1D and 2D time-dependent CCSN simulations with our multi-group radiation hydrodynamics code Fornax. We find that choices of the 3rd-order closure relations influence the time-dependent simulations only slightly.</description>

A diagnosis of the Ar densities measured by the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer aboard the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) and the temperatures derived from these densities shows that solar activity, solar insolation, and the lower atmospheric dust are the dominant forcings of the Martian thermosphere. A methodology, based on multiple linear regression analysis, is developed to quantify the contributions of the dominant forcings to the densities and temperatures.</description>

Eclipsing binary stars with an oscillating giant component allow accurate stellar parameters to be derived and asteroseismic methods to be tested and calibrated. To this aim, suitable systems need to be firstly identified and secondly measured precisely and accurately. KIC 4054905 is one such system, which has been identified, but with measurements of a relatively low precision and with some confusion regarding its parameters and evolutionary state.</description>

Nitrous oxide (N2O) &amp;ndash; a product of microbial nitrogen metabolism &amp;ndash; is a compelling exoplanet biosignature gas with distinctive spectral features in the near- and mid-infrared, and only minor abiotic sources on Earth. Previous investigations of N2O as a biosignature have examined scenarios using Earthlike N2O mixing ratios or surface fluxes, or those inferred from Earth&amp;rsquo;s geologic record. However, biological fluxes of N2O could be substantially higher, due to a lack of metal catalysts or if the last step of the denitrification metabolism that yields N2 from N2O had never evolved.</description>

      <description>First author: Megan Taylor Tillman
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback models are generally calibrated to reproduce galaxy observables such as the stellar mass function and the bimodality in galaxy colors. We use variations of the AGN feedback implementations in the IllustrisTNG (TNG) and Simba cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to show that the low redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest provides powerful independent constraints on the impact of AGN feedback. We show that TNG over predicts the number density of absorbers at column densities $N_{\rm HI} &amp;lt; 10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ compared to data from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (in agreement with previous work), and we demonstrate explicitly that its kinetic feedback mode, which is primarily responsible for galaxy quenching, has a negligible impact on the column density distribution (CDD) of absorbers.</description>

Whereas repulsive gravity was considered as a fringe concept until the mid-1990&amp;rsquo;s, the growingexperimental evidence since this epoch for repulsive gravity, in what is now called Dark Energy,for lack of a better understanding of its nature, has led to a vast literature in order to attemptto characterize this repulsive component, and notably its equation of state. In the following, Iwill show that we can use cosmology to test the hypothesis that antimatter is at the origin ofrepulsive gravity, may play the role of a Dark Energy component and, more surprisingly, maymimic the presence of Dark Matter, and justify the MOND phenomenology.</description>

The observed spectral lags of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been widely used to explore possible violations of Lorentz invariance. However, these studies were generally performed by concentrating on the rough time lag of a single highest-energy photon and ignoring the intrinsic time lag at the source. A new way to test nonbirefringent Lorentz-violating effects has been proposed by analyzing the multi-photon spectral-lag behavior of a GRB that displays a positive-to-negative transition.</description>

Fast neutrino -flavor conversion (FFC) is a possible game-changing ingredient in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) theory. In this Letter, we examine the impact of FFC on explosive nucleosynthesis by including the effects of FFC in conjunction with asymmetric neutrino emission into nucleosynthetic computations in a parametric way. We find that the ejecta compositions are not appreciably affected by FFC for elements lighter than Co, while the compositions are influenced by FFC for the heavier elements.</description>

We embed linear and nonlinear parametrisations of beyond standard cosmological physics in the halo model reaction framework, providing a model-independent prescription for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. As an application, we focus on Horndeski theories, using the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE) to parameterise linear and quasi-nonlinear perturbations. In the nonlinear regime we investigate both a nonlinear parameterised-post Friedmann (nPPF) approach as well as a physically motivated and approximate phenomenological model based on the error function (Erf).</description>

The probability distribution of density in isothermal, supersonic, turbulent gas is approximately lognormal. This behaviour can be traced back to the shock waves travelling through the medium, which randomly adjust the density by a random factor of the local sonic Mach number squared. Provided a certain parcel of gas experiences a large number of shocks, due to the central limit theorem, the resulting distribution for density is lognormal.</description>

Benzonitrile (c-C6H5CN) has been recently detected in cold and dense regions of the interstellar medium (ISM), where it has been used as a signpost of a rich aromatic organic chemistry that might lead to the production of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). One possible origin of this benzonitrile is interstellar ice chemistry involving benzene (c-C6H6) and nitrile molecules (organic molecules containing the -CN group). We have addressed the plausibility of this c-C6H5CN formation pathway through laboratory experiments using our new setup SPACE TIGER.</description>

Conventional orbit determination revealed a high-degree of orbital similarity between the components. We then applied a fragmentation model to fit the astrometry, obtaining key parameters including the fragmentation epochs and separation velocities.</description>

The detection of a fast radio burst (FRB), FRB 200428, coincident with an X-ray burst (XRB) from the Galactic magnetar soft gamma repeater (SGR) SGR J1935+2154 suggests that magnetars can produce FRBs. Many XRBs have been detected from the source but none were associated with bursty radio emission. Meanwhile, a number of weaker radio bursts have been detected from the source, which could in principle be slow radio bursts (SRBs): FRBs detected at viewing angles outside the FRB jet cone.</description>

Recent radio-frequency probes, with the ATCA and ASKAP telescopes, have proven themselves to be at the forefront of placing indirect limits on the properties of dark matter. The latter being able to substantially exceed the constraining power of Fermi-LAT data. However, these observations were based only on dwarf galaxies, where magnetic field uncertainties are large. Here we re-examine the case for galaxy clusters, often ignored due to substantial diffuse radio backgrounds, by considering the extrapolation of known cluster surface brightness profiles down to scales observable with MeerKAT.</description>

We present a machine learning based classifier for the Z-wise vs S-wise spirals, which can help to break the degeneracy in the galaxy spin direction measurement.</description>

In this paper we have introduced a novel method for gamma hadron separation in Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT) using Quantum Machine Learning. IACTs captures images of Extensive Air Showers (EAS) produced from very high energy gamma rays. We have used the QML Algorithms, Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC) and Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) for binary classification of the events into signals (Gamma) and background(hadron) using the image parameters.</description>

We present an in-depth analysis of gas morphologies for a sample of 25 Milky Way-like galaxies from the Illustris TNG50 simulation. We constrain the morphology of cold, warm, hot gas, and gas particles as a whole using a Local Shell Iterative Method (LSIM) and explore its observational implications by computing the hard-to-soft X-ray ratio, which ranges between $10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}$ in the inner $\sim 50 \rm kpc$ of the distribution and $10^{-5}$-$10^{-4}$ at the outer portion of the hot gas distribution.</description>

The metallicity distributions of globular cluster (GC) systems in galaxies are a critical test of any GC formation scenario. In this work, we investigate the predicted GC metallicity distributions of galaxies in the MOdelling Star cluster population Assembly In Cosmological Simulations within EAGLE (E-MOSAICS) simulation of a representative cosmological volume ($L = 34.4$ comoving Mpc). We find that the predicted GC metallicity distributions and median metallicities from the fiducial E-MOSAICS GC formation model agree well the observed distributions, except for galaxies with masses $M_\ast \sim 2 \times 10^{10}$ M$\odot$, which contain an overabundance of metal-rich GCs.</description>

The accretion of dark matter around the primordial black holes (PBHs) could lead to the formation of surrounding minihalos, whose mass can be several orders of magnitude higher than the central PBH mass. The gravitational microlensing produced by such dressed PBHs could be quite different from that of the bare PBHs, which may greatly affect the constraints on the PBH abundance. In this paper, we study the gravitational microlensing produced by dressed PBHs in details.</description>

      <description>First author: Tamar Meshveliani
Milky Way (MW) satellites exhibit a diverse range of internal kinematics, reflecting in turn a diverse set of subhalo density profiles. These profiles include large cores and dense cusps, which any successful dark matter model must explain simultaneously. A plausible driver of such diversity is self-interactions between dark matter particles (SIDM) if the cross section passes the threshold for the gravothermal collapse phase at the characteristic velocities of the MW satellites.</description>

The existence of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos has been unambiguously demonstrated, but their sources remain elusive. IceCube reported an association of a 290-TeV neutrino with a gamma-ray flare of TXS 0506+056, an active galactic nucleus with a compact radio jet pointing to us. Later, radio blazars were shown to be associated with IceCube neutrino events with high statistical significance. These associations remained unconfirmed with the data of independent experiments.</description>

      <description>First author: Po-Wen Chang
The origin of the high-energy astrophysical neutrinos discovered by IceCube remains largely unknown. Multi-messenger studies have indicated that the majority of these neutrinos come from gamma-ray-dark sources. Choked-jet supernovae (cjSNe), which are supernovae powered by relativistic jets stalled in stellar materials, may lead to neutrino emission via photohadronic interactions while the coproduced gamma rays are absorbed. In this paper, we perform an unbinned-maximum-likelihood analysis to search for correlations between IceCube&amp;rsquo;s 10-year muon-track events and our SN Ib/c sample, collected from publicly available catalogs.</description>

The Moon is traditionally thought to have coalesced from the debris ejected by a giant impact onto the early Earth. However, such models struggle to explain the similar isotopic compositions of Earth and lunar rocks at the same time as the system&amp;rsquo;s angular momentum, and the details of potential impact scenarios are hotly debated. Above a high resolution threshold for simulations, we find that giant impacts can immediately place a satellite with similar mass and iron content to the Moon into orbit far outside the Earth&amp;rsquo;s Roche limit.</description>

21 cm intensity mapping (IM) has the potential to be a strong and unique probe of cosmology from redshift of order unity to redshift potentially as high as 30. For post-reionization 21 cm observations, the signal is modulated by the thermal and dynamical reaction of gas in the galaxies to the passage of ionization fronts during the Epoch of Reionization. In this work, we investigate the impact of inhomogeneous reionization on the post-reionization 21 cm power spectrum and the induced shifts of cosmological parameters at redshifts $3.</description>

Obtaining high-quality magnetic and velocity fields through Stokes inversion is crucial in solar physics. In this paper, we present a new deep learning method, named Stacked Deep Neural Networks (SDNN), for inferring line-of-sight (LOS) velocities and Doppler widths from Stokes profiles collected by the Near InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS) on the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). The training data of SDNN is prepared by a Milne-Eddington (ME) inversion code used by BBSO.</description>

The majority of brown dwarfs show some level of photometric or spectro-photometric variability in different wavelength ranges. This variability allow us to trace the 3D atmospheric structures of variable brown dwarfs and directly-imaged exoplanets with radiative-transfer models and mapping codes. Nevertheless, to date, we do not have an informed method to pre-select the brown dwarfs that might show a higher variability amplitude for a thorough variability study.</description>

After introducing the topic, important types of small-scale solar magnetic field elements are outlined to then focus on their creation and evolution, and finally end up describing foremost processes these magnetic fields are involved in, such as the reconnection of magnetic field lines and the creation of magneto-hydrodynamic waves.</description>

The role of electron captures by nuclei in the shallow heating of magnetars is further investigated using both nuclear measurements and the theoretical atomic mass table HFB-27. Starting from the composition of the outer crust in full equilibrium, we have calculated the onset of electron captures and the heat released due to the slow decay of the magnetic field. Numerical results are found to be similar to those previously obtained with the HFB-24 atomic mass model and are consistent with neutron-star cooling data.</description>

      <description>First author: David Vizgan
One of the most fundamental baryonic matter components of galaxies is the neutral atomic hydrogen (H$,{\rm \scriptsize I}$). At low redshifts, this component can be traced directly through the 21-cm transition, but to infer H$,{\rm \scriptsize I}$ gas content of the most distant galaxies, a viable tracer is needed. We here investigate the fidelity of the fine structure transition of the ($^2P_{3/2} - ^2P_{1/3}$) transition of singly-ionized carbon [C$,{\rm \scriptsize II}$] at $158,\mu$m as a proxy for H$,{\rm \scriptsize I}$ in a set simulated galaxies at $z\approx 6$, following the work by Heintz et al.</description>

Using 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations, we study the effects of ionising radiation on the formation of second-generation (SG) stars in Globular Clusters (GCs) with multiple stellar populations. In particular, we focus on massive ($10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and young (40-Myr old) GCs. We consider stellar winds from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, ram pressure, gas accretion onto the cluster, and photoionisation feedback of binary stars. We find that the stellar luminosity is strong enough to warm and ionise the intracluster medium, but it does not lead to a significant gas expulsion.</description>

Distinguishing signal of young gas rich circumstellar disks from stellar signal in near infrared light is a difficult task. Current techniques such as Angular Differential Imaging (ADI) and Polarimetric Differential Imaging (PDI) cope with drawbacks such as self-subtraction. To address these drawbacks we explore Iterative Angular Differential Imaging (IADI) techniques to increase signal throughput in total intensity observations. This work aims to explore the effectiveness of IADI to recover the self-subtracted regions of disks by applying ADI techniques iteratively.</description>

Classical sources are long and short Gamma-ray bursts as well as hidden jets in core-collapse supernovae. Detection of jet-GWs from these sources will require detectors, such as the proposed BBO, DECIGO and lunar based detectors, that will operate in the deciHz band.</description>

We present constraints on the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model through a joint analysis of galaxy abundance, galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing observables with the Kilo-Degree Survey. Our theoretical model combines a flexible conditional stellar mass function, to describe the galaxy-halo connection, with a cosmological N-body simulation-calibrated halo model to describe the non-linear matter field. Our magnitude-limited bright galaxy sample combines 9-band optical-to-near-infrared photometry with an extensive and complete spectroscopic training sample to provide accurate redshift and stellar mass estimates.</description>

CMB mapmaking relies on a data model to solve for the sky map, and this process is vulnerable to bias if the data model cannot capture the full behavior of the signal. I demonstrate that this bias is not just limited to small-scale effects in high-contrast regions of the sky, but can manifest as $\mathcal{O}(1)$ power loss on large scales in the map under conditions and assumptions realistic for ground-based CMB telescopes.</description>

VLT/FORS2 observations in the nebular phase at 150 d reveal that the spectrum is dominated by oxygen and magnesium emission lines of different transitions and ionization states: O I, [O I], [O II], [O III], Mg I, and Mg II.</description>

      <description>First author: Marc-Antoine Fortin
The recent first measurements of the reflection of the surface of a lava world provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate different stages of rocky planet evolution. The spectral features of the surfaces of rocky lava world exoplanets give insights into their evolution, mantle composition and inner workings. However, no database exists yet that contains spectral reflectivity and emission of a wide range of potential exoplanet surface materials.</description>

The aging and gradual brightening of the Sun will challenge Earth&amp;rsquo;s habitability in the next few billion years. If life exists elsewhere in the Universe, the aging of their host star will similarly pose an existential threat. One solution to this threat, which we dub a Lazarus star, is for an advanced civilization to remove (or &amp;ldquo;star-lift&amp;rdquo;) mass from their host star at a rate which offsets the increase in luminosity, keeping the flux on the habitable planet(s) constant and extending the lifetime of their star.</description>

Astrobot swarms are used to capture astronomical signals to generate the map of the observable universe for the purpose of dark energy studies. The convergence of each swarm in the course of its coordination has to surpass a particular threshold to yield a satisfactory map. The current coordination methods do not always reach desired convergence rates. Moreover, these methods are so complicated that one cannot formally verify their results without resource-demanding simulations.</description>

We simulate the evolution of relativistic electrons injected into the medium of a small galaxy cluster by a central radio galaxy, studying how the initial jet power affects the dispersal and the emission properties of radio plasma. By coupling passive tracer particles to adaptive-mesh cosmological MHD simulations, we study how cosmic-ray electrons are dispersed as a function of the input jet power. We also investigate how the latter affects the thermal and non-thermal properties of the intracluster medium, with differences discernible up to $\sim$ Gyr after the start of the jet.</description>

      <description>First author: Aaron J. Romanowsky
The classical globular clusters found in all galaxy types have half-light radii of $r_{\rm h} \sim$ 2-4 pc, which have been tied to formation in the dense cores of giant molecular clouds. Some old star clusters have larger sizes, and it is unclear if these represent a fundamentally different mode of low-density star cluster formation. We report the discovery of a rare, young &amp;ldquo;faint fuzzy&amp;rdquo; star cluster, NGC 247-SC1, on the outskirts of the low-mass spiral galaxy NGC 247 in the nearby Sculptor group, and measure its radial velocity using Keck spectroscopy.</description>

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely strong radio flares lasting several micro- to milliseconds and come from unidentified objects at cosmological distances, most of which are only seen once. Based on recently published data in the CHIME/FRB Catalog 1 in the frequency bands 400-800 MHz, we analyze 125 apparently singular FRBs with low dispersion measure (DM) and find that the distribution of their luminosity follows a lognormal form according to statistical tests.</description>

Wide-field time domain facilities detect transient events in large numbers through difference imaging. For example, Zwicky Transient Facility produces alerts for hundreds of thousands of transient events per night, a rate set to be dwarfed by the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory. The automation provided by Machine Learning (ML) is, therefore, necessary to classify these events and select the most interesting sources for follow-up observations. Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) are a transient class that are numerous, bright, and nearby, providing excellent laboratories for the study of accretion and binary evolution.</description>

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are one of the most mysterious astronomical transients. Observationally, they can be classified into repeaters and apparently non-repeaters. However, due to the lack of continuous observations, some apparently repeaters may have been incorrectly recognized as non-repeaters. In a series of two papers, we intend to solve such problem with machine learning. In this second paper of the series, we focus on an array of unsupervised machine learning methods.</description>

The small semi-major axes of Hot Jupiters lead to high atmospheric temperatures of up to several thousand Kelvin. Under these conditions, thermally ionised metals provide a rich source of charged particles and thus build up a sizeable electrical conductivity. Subsequent electromagnetic effects, such as the induction of electric currents, Ohmic heating, magnetic drag, or the weakening of zonal winds have thus far been considered mainly in the framework of a linear, steady-state model of induction.</description>

Magnetohydrodynamics simulation of active region NOAA 11515 is performed to examine the initiation of the M5.6 flaring event that starts around 10:43 UT on 2012 July 2. The simulation is conducted using an extrapolated non-force-free magnetic field generated from the photospheric vector magnetogram of the active region as the initial magnetic field. The magnetic field shows the presence of a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic null with the corresponding dome overlying a filament and a low-lying magnetic flux rope, observed in 304~\AA~ and 131~\AA~ respectively.</description>

We present a method for mapping variations between probability distribution functions and apply this method within the context of measuring galaxy redshift distributions from imaging survey data. This method, which we name PITPZ for the probability integral transformations it relies on, uses a difference in curves between distribution functions in an ensemble as a transformation to apply to another distribution function, thus transferring the variation in the ensemble to the latter distribution function.</description>

We present deep near-infrared (NIR) imaging of Sh 2-209 (S209), a low-metallicity (${\rm [O/H]} = - 0.5$ dex) HII region in the Galaxy. From the NIR images, combined with astrometric data from Gaia EDR3, we estimate the distance to S209 to be 2.5 kpc. This is close enough to enable us to resolve cluster members clearly ($\simeq$1000 AU separation) down to a mass-detection limit of $\simeq$0.</description>

We find OBe star fractions of ~20% in the Large Magellanic Cloud (0.</description>

Titan has a diverse range of materials in its atmosphere and on its surface: the simple organics that reside in various phases (gas, liquid, ice) and the solid complex refractory organics that form Titan&amp;rsquo;s haze layers. These materials all actively participate in various physical processes on Titan, and many material properties are found to be important in shaping these processes. Future in-situ exploration on Titan would likely encounter a range of materials, and a comprehensive database to archive the material properties of all possible material candidates will be needed.</description>

Primordial black holes (PBHs) may form from the collapse of matter overdensities shortly after the Big Bang. One may identify their existence by observing gravitational wave (GW) emissions from merging PBH binaries at high redshifts $z\gtrsim 30$, where astrophysical binary black holes (BBHs) are unlikely to merge. The next-generation ground-based GW detectors, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, will be able to observe BBHs with total masses of $\mathcal{O}(10-100)~M_{\odot}$ at such redshifts.</description>

      <description>First author: James Paynter
The remnants of binary black hole mergers can be given recoil kick velocities up to $\unit[5,000]{km,s^{-1}}$ due to anisotropic emission of gravitational waves. E1821+643 is a recoiling supermassive black hole moving at $\sim \unit[2,100]{km,s^{-1}}$ along the line-of-sight relative to its host galaxy. This suggests a recoil kick of $\sim \unit[2,240]{km,s^{-1}}$. Such a kick is powerful enough to eject E1821+643 from its $M_\text{gal}\sim2 \times \unit[10^{12}]{M_\odot}$ host galaxy.</description>

We have found significant flux oscillations with periods of about 3, 5 and 13 minutes emitted from AR12833. The 3-minute periodicity dominates at higher frequencies. It was found that the apparent level of oscillations depends on the active region location on the disc, and scales down towards the limbs.</description>

We analyze the MOA-2020-BLG-208 gravitational microlensing event and present the discovery and characterization of a new planet with an estimated sub-Saturn mass. With a mass ratio $q = 3.17^{+0.28}{-0.26} \times 10^{-4}$ and a separation $s = 1.3807^{+0.0018}{-0.0018}$, the planet lies near the peak of the mass-ratio function derived by the MOA collaboration (Suzuki et al. 2016), near the edge of expected sample sensitivity. For these estimates we provide results using two mass law priors: one assuming that all stars have an equal planet-hosting probability, and the other assuming that planets are more likely to orbit around more massive stars.</description>

Rotation is typically assumed to induce strictly symmetric rotational splitting into the rotational multiplets of pure p- and g-modes. However, for evolved stars exhibiting mixed modes, avoided crossings between different multiplet components are known to yield asymmetric rotational splitting, particularly for near-degenerate mixed-mode pairs, where notional pure p-modes are fortuitiously in resonance with pure g-modes. These near-degeneracy effects have been described in subgiants, but their consequences for the characterisation of internal rotation in red giants has not previously been investigated in detail, in part owing to theoretical intractability.</description>

Forming massive stars launch outflows of magnetic origin, which in fact serve as a marker for finding sites of massive star formation. However, both the theoretical and observational study of the mechanisms that intervene in the formation and propagation of such outflows has been possible only until recent years. With this work, we aim to study in detail the mechanisms that drive highly collimated outflows from early stages of the formation of a massive star, and how those processes are impacted by the properties of the natal environment of the forming massive star.</description>

Relativistic plasma flows from the jets of black hole binary systems consist the environment of multiple particle production and radiation emission including neutrinos and gamma-rays. We implement a hadronic model based on $p-p$ interactions with the purpose of predicting the produced secondary particle distributions inside the jet. Our ultimate goal is the neutrino and gamma-ray intensities calculation while taking into account the most important gamma-ray absorption processes in order to present more realistic results.</description>

We present an updated model for the extragalactic background light (EBL) from stars and dust, over wavelengths approximately 0.1 to 1000 $\mu$m. This model uses accurate theoretical stellar spectra, and tracks the evolution of star formation, stellar mass density, metallicity, and interstellar dust extinction and emission in the universe with redshift. Dust emission components are treated self-consistently, with stellar light absorbed by dust reradiated in the infrared as three blackbody components.</description>

Scandium is a key element of the Am star phenomenon since its surface under-abundance is one of the criteria that characterise such stars. Thanks to the availability of a sufficiently complete set of theoretical atomic data for this element, reliable radiative accelerations for Sc can now be computed, which allows its behaviour under the action of atomic diffusion to be modelled. We explore the required conditions, in terms of mixing processes or mass loss, for our models to reproduce the observed surface abundances of Sc in Am stars.</description>

      <description>First author: Charity Woodrum
We explore how the presence of detectable molecular gas depends on the inferred star formation histories (SFHs) in 8 massive, quiescent galaxies at $\mathrm{z\sim0.7}$. Half of the sample have clear detections of molecular gas, traced by CO(2-1). We find that the molecular gas content is unrelated to the rate of star formation decline prior to the most recent 1 Gyr, suggesting that the gas reservoirs are not leftover from their primary star formation epoch.</description>

      <description>First author: Susanne Pfalzner
The lifetime of protoplanetary disks is a crucial parameter for planet formation research. Observations of disk fractions in star clusters imply median disk lifetimes of 1 &amp;ndash; 3 Myr. This very short disk lifetime calls for planet formation to occur extremely rapidly. We show that young, distant clusters ($\leq$ 5 Myr, $&amp;gt;$ 200 pc) often dominate these types of studies. Such clusters frequently suffer from limiting magnitudes leading to an over-representation of high-mass stars.</description>

      <description>First author: H. Abe
We study the broadband emission of the TeV blazar Mrk501 using multi-wavelength (MWL) observations from 2017 to 2020 performed with a multitude of instruments, involving, among others, MAGIC, Fermi-LAT, NuSTAR, Swift, GASP-WEBT, and OVRO. During this period, Mrk501 showed an extremely low broadband activity, which may help to unravel its baseline emission. Despite the low activity, significant flux variations are detected at all wavebands, with the highest variations occurring at X-rays and VHE $\gamma$-rays.</description>

LHAASO J2108+5157 is one of the few known unidentified Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) gamma-ray sources with no Very-High-Energy (VHE) counterpart, recently discovered by the LHAASO collaboration. We observed LHAASO J2108+5157 in the X-ray band with XMM-Newton in 2021 for a total of 3.8 hours and at TeV energies with the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1), yielding 49 hours of good quality data. In addition, we analyzed 12 years of Fermi-LAT data, to better constrain emission of its High-Energy (HE) counterpart 4FGL J2108.</description>

Chemical and mineral compositions of asteroids reflect the formation and history of our Solar System. This knowledge is also important for planetary defence and in-space resource utilisation. We aim to develop a fast and robust neural-network-based method for deriving the mineral modal and chemical compositions of silicate materials from their visible and near-infrared spectra. The method should be able to process raw spectra without significant pre-processing.</description>

On September 18, 2022, an alert by ceCube indicated that a ~170TeV neutrino arrived in directional coincidence with the blazar TXS 0506+056. This event adds to two previous ones: a neutrino alert from its direction on September 22, 2017, and a 3sigma signature of a dozen neutrinos in 2014/2015. deBruijn 2020 showed that these two previous neutrino emission episodes could be due to a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) where jet precession close to final coalescence results in periodic emission.</description>

The ultra-short-period (USP) planets are exoplanets with very short orbital periods ($\textit{P} &amp;lt; 1$ day), and TOI-1807b is one such planet recently discovered by the TESS mission where it orbits in the TOI-1807 system that is still little known nowadays. In this paper, we re-analyzed the transit light curves of TOI-1807 using the latest TESS data from Sector 49, combined with previous data from Sector 22 and 23.</description>

We report the discovery of NGTS-21b, a massive hot Jupiter orbiting a low-mass star as part of the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS). The planet has a mass and radius of $2.36 \pm 0.21$ M${\rm J}$, and $1.33 \pm 0.03$ R${\rm J}$, and an orbital period of 1.543 days. The host is a K3V ($T_{\rm eff}=4660 \pm 41$, K) metal-poor (${\rm [Fe/H]}=-0.26 \pm 0.07$, dex) dwarf star with a mass and radius of $0.</description>

Understanding the radiative-dynamical coupling between upper photosphere and deeper atmosphere is a key in understanding the abnormal large radii of hot Jupiters. One needs very long integration times of 3D general circulation models (GCMs) with self consistent radiative transfer to achieve a better understanding of the feedback process between dynamics and radiation. We here present the longest 3D non-gray GCM study (86000 d) of an ultra hot Jupiter (WASP-76 b) published to this date that reached a final converged state.</description>

The composition the atmosphere of Venus results from the integration of many processes entering into play over the entire geological history of the planet. Determining the elemental abundances and isotopic ratios of noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and stable isotopes (H, C, N, O, S) in the Venus atmosphere is a high priority scientific target since it could open a window on the origin and early evolution of the entire planet.</description>

The shape of emission lines in the optical spectra of star-forming galaxies reveals the kinematics of the diffuse gaseous component. We analyse the shape of prominent emission lines in a sample of ~53,000 star-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, focusing on departures from gaussianity. Departures from a single gaussian profile allow us to probe the motion of gas and to assess the role of outflows.</description>

      <description>First author: Ryosuke T. Tominaga
In our previous work (Paper I), we demonstrated that coagulation instability results in dust concentration against depletion due to the radial drift and accelerates dust growth locally. In this work (Paper II), we perform numerical simulations of coagulation instability taking into account effects of backreaction to gas and collisional fragmentation of dust grains. We find that the slowdown of the dust drift due to backreaction regulates dust concentration in the nonlinear growth phase of coagulation instability.</description>

Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are massive star clusters found in all types of galaxies from dwarfs to massive galaxies. Recent studies show that while low-mass NSCs in dwarf galaxies ($M_\text{gal} &amp;lt; 10^{9} M_\odot$) form predominantly out of the merger of globular clusters (GCs), high-mass NSCs in massive galaxies have assembled most of their mass through central enriched star formation. So far, these results of a transition in the dominant NSC formation channel have been based on studies of early-type galaxies and massive late-type galaxies.</description>

An important parameter in the theory of hot accretion flows around black holes is $\delta$, which describes the fraction of ``viscously&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; dissipated energy in the accretion flow that directly heats the electrons. The radiative efficiency of a hot accretion flow is determined by its value if other parameters, such as the accretion rate, are determined. Unfortunately, the value of $\delta$ is hard to determine from first principles.</description>

We present the analysis of existing optical photometry and new optical spectroscopy of the candidate cataclysmic variable star OGLE-BLG504.12.201843. As was shown previously, this object has an orbital period of 0.523419 days and exhibits year-long outbursts with a mean period of 973 days. Using digitized photographic archives, we show that the earliest recorded outburst occurred in 1910. We propose that this object is a U Gem-type dwarf nova with extreme properties.</description>

We examine the migration of luminous low-mass cores in laminar protoplanetary discs where accretion occurs mainly because of disc winds and where the planet luminosity is generated by pebble accretion. Using 2D hydrodynamical simulations, we determine the eccentricities induced by thermal forces as a function of gas and pebble accretion rates, and also evaluate the importance of the torque exerted by the solid component relative to the gas torque.</description>

Although a large number of Galactic open clusters (OCs) have been identified, the internal kinematic properties (e.g., rotation) of almost all the known OCs are still far from clear. With the high-precision astrometric data of Gaia EDR3, we have developed a methodology to unveil the rotational properties of the Praesepe cluster. Statistics of the three-dimensional residual motions of the member stars reveal the presence of Praesepe&amp;rsquo;s rotation and determine its spatial rotation axis.</description>

Mass distribution of black holes in low-mass X-ray binaries previously suggested the existence of a $ \sim 2-5M_{\odot} $ mass gap between the most massive neutron stars and the least massive black holes, while some recent evidence appears to support that this mass gap is being populated. Whether there is a mass gap or not can potentially shed light on the physics of supernova explosions that form neutron stars and black holes, although significant mass accretion of neutron stars including binary mergers may lead to the formation of mass-gap objects.</description>

Green pea galaxies are starbursting, low-mass galaxies that are good analogues to star-forming galaxies in the early universe. We perform a survey of 23 Green Peas using the MUSE Integral Field Unit spectrograph on the VLT to search for companion galaxies. The survey reaches an average point-source depth of $\sim 10^{-18}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for emission lines. The MUSE field of view allows us to probe a 1$\times$1 arcmin$^2$ field around these galaxies and to search their surroundings for faint companions that could have interacted with them and induced their starburst episodes.</description>

A comprehensive analysis yielded a total of 50 classical Cepheids associated with 45 open clusters, of which 39 open cluster-classical Cepheid pairs are considered probable, with the remaining 11 pairs considered improbable but worth following up. Two previously identified clusters by us possibly host classical Cepheids (OC-0125/V1788 Cyg and OC-0675/OGLE-BLG-CEP-114).</description>

The sunlight reflected from the Moon during a total lunar eclipse has been transmitted through the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere on the way to the Moon. The combination of multiple scattering and inhomogeneous atmospheric characteristics during that transmission can potentially polarize that light. A similar (although much smaller) effect should also be observable from the atmosphere of a transiting exoplanet. We present the results of polarization observations during the first 15 minutes of totality of the lunar eclipse of 2022 May 16.</description>

      <description>First author: Jian Wu
Previous studies found that stellar scattering by massive clumps can lead to the formation of exponential profiles in galaxy discs, but details on how a star is moved around have not been fully explained. We use a GADGET-2 simulation where an exponential profile forms from an initially Gaussian disc in about 4 Gyr for a low-mass galaxy like a dwarf irregular. We find that nearly all large angular momentum changes of stars are caused by star-clump encounters with the closest approach less than 0.</description>

We use three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations to study the formation of massive star clusters under the combined effects of direct ultraviolet (UV) and dust-reprocessed infrared (IR) radiation pressure. We explore a broad range of mass surface density $\Sigma \sim 10^2$-$10^5 , \mathrm{M}{\odot} , \mathrm{pc}^{-2}$, spanning values typical of weakly star-forming galaxies to extreme systems such as clouds forming super-star clusters, where radiation pressure is expected to be the dominant feedback mechanism.</description>

Reverberation mapping measurements have been used to constrain the relationship between the size of the broad-line region and luminosity of active galactic nuclei (AGN). This $R-L$ relation is used to estimate single-epoch virial black hole masses, and has been proposed for use to standardise AGN to determine cosmological distances. We present reverberation measurements made with H$\beta$ from the six-year Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES) Reverberation Mapping Program.</description>

This nebula is hence an ideal case study for understanding PN shaping and evolution processes. Accordingly, we have conducted a comprehensive imaging survey of NGC 7027 comprised of twelve HST Wide Field Camera 3 images in narrow-band and continuum filters spanning the wavelength range 0.</description>

      <description>First author: László Gondán
The environment surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei (GNs) is expected to harbour stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) populations. These binaries were suggested to form a hierarchical triple system with the SMBH, and gravitational perturbations from the SMBH can enhance the mergers of BBHs through Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations. Previous studies determined the expected binary parameter distribution for this merger channel in single GNs. Here we account for the different spatial distribution and mass distribution models of BBHs around SMBHs and perform direct high-precision regularized N-body simulations, including Post-Newtonian (PN) terms up to order PN2.</description>

We demonstrate the utility of deep learning for modeling the clustering of particles that are aerodynamically coupled to turbulent fluids. Using a Lagrangian particle module within the ATHENA++ hydrodynamics code, we simulate the dynamics of particles in the Epstein drag regime within a periodic domain of isotropic forced hydrodynamic turbulence. This setup is an idealized model relevant to the collisional growth of micron to mmsized dust particles in early stage planet formation.</description>

      <description>First author: Lennart Röver
Non-Gaussian likelihoods, ubiquitous throughout cosmology, are a direct consequence of nonlinearities in the physical model. Their treatment requires Monte-Carlo Markov-chain or more advanced sampling methods for the determination of confidence contours. As an alternative, we construct canonical partition functions as Laplace-transforms of the Bayesian evidence, from which MCMC-methods would sample microstates. Cumulants of order $n$ of the posterior distribution follow by direct $n$-fold differentiation of the logarithmic partition function, recovering the classic Fisher-matrix formalism at second order.</description>

      <description>First author: M. Harsoula
Observations and simulations of barred spiral galaxies have shown that, in general, the spiral arms rotate at a different pattern speed to that of the bar. The main conclusion from the bibliography is that the bar rotates faster than the spiral arms with a double or even a triple value of angular velocity. The theory that prevails in explaining the formation of the spiral arms in the case of a barred spiral galaxy with two pattern speeds is the manifold theory, where the orbits that support the spiral density wave are chaotic, and are related to the manifolds emanating from the Lagrangian points L_1 and L_2 at the end of the bar.</description>

      <description>First author: Nguyen Chau Giang
Magnetic fields ($\textbf{B}$) are an important factor that controls the star formation process. The leading method to observe $\textbf{B}$ is using polarized thermal emission from dust grains aligned with $\textbf{B}$. However, in dense environments such as protostellar cores, dust grains may have inefficient alignment due to strong gas randomizations, so that using dust polarization to trace $\textbf{B}$ is uncertain. Hoang $&amp;amp;$ Lazarian (2016) demonstrated that the grain alignment by RAdiative Torques is enhanced if dust grains contain embedded iron inclusions.</description>

We search for the reasons behind the spectroscopic diversity of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) in the pre-maximum phase. Our analysis is a continuation of the paper of \citet{ktr21}, who disclosed two new subtypes of SLSNe-I characterized by the presence/absence of a W-shaped absorption feature in their pre-maximum spectra between 4000 and 5000 \AA (called Type~W and Type~15bn, respectively). However, the physical cause of this bimodality is still uncertain.</description>

      <description>First author: Chiara Animali
If the inflaton gets trapped in a local minimum of its potential shortly before the end of inflation, it escapes by building up quantum fluctuations in a process known as stochastic tunnelling. In this work we study cosmological fluctuations produced in such a scenario, and how likely they are to form Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). This is done by using the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism, which allows us to reconstruct the highly non-Gaussian tails of the distribution function of the number of $e$-folds spent in the false-vacuum state.</description>

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), as they can inject a large amounts of mass and magnetic flux into the interplanetary space, are the primary source of space weather phenomena on the Earth. The present review first briefly introduces the solar surface signatures of the origins of CMEs and then focuses on the attempts to understand the kinematic evolution of CMEs from the Sun to the Earth. CMEs have been observed in the solar corona in white-light from a series of space missions over the last five decades.</description>

      <description>First author: Bo Wang
Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have the potential to detect Nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) that are usually generated by the individual inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the galactic centers. The GW signals as cosmological standard sirens can provide the absolute cosmic distances, thereby can be used to constrain the cosmological parameters. In this paper, we analyze the ability of future SKA-era PTAs to detect the existing SMBHBs candidates assuming the root mean square of timing noise $\sigma_t=20\ {\rm ns}$, and use the simulated PTA data to constrain the interacting dark energy (IDE) models with energy transfer rate $Q = \beta H\rho_c$.</description>

Local early-type galaxies with directly-measured black hole masses, $M_{\rm bh}$, have been reported to represent a biased sample relative to the population at large. Such galaxies with Spitzer Space Telescope imaging have been purported to possess velocity dispersions, $\sigma$, at least $\sim$0.1 dex larger for a given galaxy stellar mass, $M_{\rm ,gal}$, than is typically observed among thousands of early-type galaxies imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.</description>

A potential crewed mission to Mars would require us to solve a number of problems, including how to protect astronauts against the devastating effects of energetic charged particles from Solar and Galactic sources. The radiation environment on Mars is of particular interest, since maintaining optimal absorbed doses by astronauts is crucial to their survival. Here, we give an overview of the conditions on Mars, as determined by theoretical models and in-situ measurements, and present the main proposed strategies to mitigate radiation exposure while on Mars.</description>

The existence of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift seems to require rapid quenching, but it is unclear whether all quiescent galaxies have gone through this phase and what physical mechanisms are involved. To study rapid quenching, we use rest-frame colors to select 12 young quiescent galaxies at $z \sim 1.5$. From spectral energy distribution fitting, we find that they all experienced intense starbursts prior to rapid quenching.</description>

The standard $\Lambda$CDM model is recently reported to deviate from the high-redshift Hubble diagram of type Ia supernovae (SNe) and quasars (QSOs) at $\sim4\sigma$ confidence level. In this work, we combine the PAge approximation (a nearly model-independent parameterization) and a high-quality QSO sample to search for the origins of the deviation. By visualizing the $\Lambda$CDM model and the marginalized $3\sigma$ constraints of SNe+QSOs into PAge space, we confirm that the SNe+QSOs constraints in both flat and non-flat PAge cases are in remarkable tension with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</description>

Fast and accurate treatment of collisions in the context of modern N-body planet formation simulations remains a challenging task due to inherently complex collision processes. We aim to tackle this problem with machine learning (ML), in particular via residual neural networks. Our model is motivated by the underlying physical processes of the data-generating process and allows for flexible prediction of post-collision states. We demonstrate that our model outperforms commonly used collision handling methods such as perfect inelastic merging and feed-forward neural networks in both prediction accuracy and out-of-distribution generalization.</description>

In this paper, we use a newly compiled sample of ultra-compact structure in radio quasars and strong gravitational lensing systems with quasars acting as background sources to constrain six spatially flat and non-flat cosmological models ($\Lambda$CDM, PEDE and DGP). These two sets of quasar data (the time-delay measurements of six strong lensing systems and 120 intermediate-luminosity quasars calibrated as standard rulers) could break the degeneracy between cosmological parameters ($H_0$, $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_k$) and therefore provide more stringent cosmological constraints for the six cosmological models we study.</description>

Thermonuclear (type-I) bursts arise from unstable ignition of accumulated fuel on the surface of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries. Measurements of burst properties in principle enable observers to infer the properties of the host neutron star and mass donors, but a number of confounding astrophysical effects contribute to systematic uncertainties. Here we describe some commonly-used approaches for determining system parameters, including composition of the burst fuel, and introduce a new suite of software tools, concord, intended to fully account for astrophysical uncertainties.</description>

      <description>First author: Muhammad A. Latif
Direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) are the leading candidates for the origin of the first supermassive black holes. However, the role of magnetic fields during their formation is still unclear as none of the previous studies has been evolved long enough to assess their impact during the accretion phase. Here, we report the results from a suite of 3D cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations which are evolved for 1.</description>

      <description>First author: Shreya Bhattacharya
The focus of this study is to reveal the reason behind a scale problem detected around 1849 in the historical version of the International Sunspot Number Series, i.e. version 1 (Leussu et al, Astronomy and Astrophysics, 559, A28, 2013; Friedli, Solar Phys.291, 2505, 2016). From 1826 to 1848 Heinrich Schwabe&amp;rsquo;s observations were considered primary by Rudolf Wolf, and a shift of primary observer from Schwabe to Wolf in 1849 seems to have led to an inconsistency in the Sunspot Number series.</description>

      <description>First author: S. K. Ocker
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-timescale radio transients, the origins of which are predominantly extragalactic and likely involve highly magnetized compact objects. FRBs undergo multipath propagation, or scattering, from electron density fluctuations on sub-parsec scales in ionized gas along the line-of-sight. Scattering observations have located plasma structures within FRB host galaxies, probed Galactic and extragalactic turbulence, and constrained FRB redshifts. Scattering also inhibits FRB detection and biases the observed FRB population.</description>

      <description>First author: Louis Hamaide
Dilatons (and moduli) couple to the masses and coupling constants of ordinary matter, and these quantities are fixed by the local value of the dilaton field. If, in addition, the dilaton with mass $m_\phi$ contributes to the cosmic dark matter density, then such quantities oscillate in time at the dilaton Compton frequency. We show how these oscillations lead to broadening and shifting of the Voigt profile of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, in a manner that is correlated with the local dark matter density.</description>

(Pre-)transitional disks show gaps and cavities that can be related with on-going planet formation. According to theory, young embedded planets can accrete material from the circumplanetary and circumstellar disks, so that they could be detected in accretion tracers, like the H${\alpha}$ emission line. In this work, we present spectral angular differential imaging AO-assisted observations of five (pre-)transitional disks obtained with SPHERE/ZIMPOL at the Very Large Telescope (VLT).</description>

      <description>First author: Jens Kammerer
Observing Earth-like exoplanets orbiting within the habitable zone of Sun-like stars and studying their atmospheres in reflected starlight requires contrasts of $\sim1\mathrm{e}{-10}$ in the visible. At such high contrast, starlight reflected by exozodiacal dust is expected to be a significant source of contamination. Here, we present high-fidelity simulations of coronagraphic observations of a synthetic Solar System located at a distance of 10 pc and observed with a 12 m and an 8 m circumscribed aperture diameter space telescope operating at 500 nm wavelength.</description>

We combine half-light radii based on HSC SSP imaging with redshifts and D$n4000$ to explore the size - mass relation, $R{e} = A \times M_{*}^{\alpha}$, and its evolution for the entire HectoMAP quiescent population and for two subsets of the data.</description>

We present the discovery and analysis of SN 2022oqm, a Type Ic supernova (SN) detected &amp;lt;1 day after explosion. The SN rises to a blue and short-lived (2 days) initial peak. Early spectral observations of SN 2022oqm show a hot (40,000 K) continuum with high-ionization C and O absorption features at velocities of 4,000 km s$^{-1}$, while its photospheric radius expands at 20,000 km s$^{-1}$, indicating a pre-existing distribution of expanding C/O material, likely ejected around 2 weeks before the explosion.</description>

Spectroscopic observations in X-ray wavelengths provide excellent diagnostics of the temperature distribution in solar flare plasma. The Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) onboard the Chandrayaan-2 mission provides broad-band disk integrated soft X-ray solar spectral measurements in the energy range of 1-15 keV with high spectral resolution and time cadence. In this study, we analyse X-ray spectra of three representative GOES C-class flares obtained with the XSM to investigate the evolution of various plasma parameters during the course of the flares.</description>

      <description>First author: Sunghoon Jung
We show that chirping gravitational waves in the LIGO frequency band $f=1 - 5000$ Hz can be gravitationally diffracted by the Sun, due to the coincidence of its Fresnel length $r_F \propto \sqrt{1, {\rm AU}/f}$ and the solar radius $r_\odot$. This solar diffraction is detectable through its frequency-dependent amplification of the wave, albeit with low event rates. We also advocate that solar diffraction allows probing the inner solar profile with the chirping evolution of frequencies.</description>

Motivated by the necessity of a high-quality stray light control in the detection of the gravitational waves in space, the spot size of a flat top beam generated by the clipping of the Gaussian beam (GB) is studied. By adopting the mode expansion method (MEM) approach to simulating the beam, a slight variant of the definition of the mean square deviation (MSD) spot size for the MEM beam is proposed.</description>

LTE analysis of the lines allows us to estimate gas kinetic temperature ($\lesssim$ 30~K in all the clumps), number density ($7-17\times10^3$~cm$^{-3}$), and ammonia column density ($\approx 1-1.5\times 10^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$) in the dense clumps. We find signatures of collapse in WB 673 and presence of compact spatially unresolved dense clumps in S233-IR.</description>

A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when the gravitational field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) destroys a star. For TDEs in which the star enters deep within the tidal radius, such that the ratio of the tidal radius to the pericenter distance $\beta$ satisfies $\beta \gg 1$, the star is tidally compressed and heated. It was predicted that the maximum density and temperature attained during deep TDEs scale as $\propto \beta^3$ and $\propto \beta^2$, respectively, and nuclear detonation triggered by $\beta \gtrsim 5$, but these predictions have been debated over the last four decades.</description>

      <description>First author: Ersilia Guarini
Mounting evidence suggests that the launching of collapsar jets is magnetically driven. Recent general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of collapsars reveal that the jet is continuously loaded with baryons, owing to strong mixing with the cocoon. This results in a high photosphere at $\gtrsim 10^{12}$ cm. Consequently, collisionless internal shocks below the photosphere are disfavored, and the neutrino production in the deepest jet regions is prevented, in contrast to what has been naively assumed in the literature.</description>

The signal is expected to be of the order of a few tens of nK, prone to instrumental systematic effects and polluted by various astrophysical foregrounds which can only be controlled through multichroic observations.</description>

Massive stars evolve toward the catastrophic collapse of their innermost core, producing core-collapse supernova (SN) explosions as the end products. White dwarfs, formed through evolution of the less massive stars, also explode as thermonuclear SNe if certain conditions are met during the binary evolution. Inflating opportunities in transient observations now provide an abundance of data, with which we start addressing various unresolved problems in stellar evolution and SN explosion mechanisms.</description>

Scattered light imaging studies have detected nearly two dozen spiral arm systems in circumstellar disks, yet the formation mechanisms for most of them are still under debate. Although existing studies can use motion measurements to distinguish leading mechanisms such as planet-disk interaction and disk self-gravity, close-in stellar flybys can induce short-lived spirals and even excite arm-driving planets into highly eccentric orbits. With unprecedented stellar location and proper motion measurements from Gaia DR3, here we study for known spiral arm systems their flyby history with their stellar neighbours by formulating an analytical on-sky flyby framework.</description>

Quantifying the parameters and corresponding uncertainties of hundreds of strongly lensed quasar systems holds the key to resolving one of the most important scientific questions: the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$) tension. The commonly used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method has been too time-consuming to achieve this goal, yet recent work has shown that convolution neural networks (CNNs) can be an alternative with seven orders of magnitude improvement in speed.</description>

Here, in this work, we study the ammonia lines (J,K=1,1 and 2,2) in the prestellar core L1517B with the Very Large Array Radio Telescope (VLA). Our analysis indicates that the core is close to round in shape with a constant internal kinetic temperature of ~ 9K, suggesting the core seems to be an isothermal sphere.</description>

Atmospheres play a crucial role in planetary habitability. Around M dwarfs and young Sun-like stars, planets receiving the same insolation as the present-day Earth are exposed to intense stellar X-rays and extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) radiation. This study explores the fundamental question of whether the atmosphere of present-day Earth could survive in such harsh XUV environments. Previous theoretical studies suggest that stellar XUV irradiation is sufficiently intense to remove such atmospheres completely on short timescales.</description>

We perform 3D hydrodynamics simulations of disc-disc stellar flybys with on-the-fly Monte Carlo radiative transfer. We show that pre-existing circumstellar discs around both stars result in fast rising ($\sim$yrs) outbursts lasting 2-5 times longer than for a star-disc flyby. The perturber always goes into outburst ($\dot{M}&amp;gt;10^{-5}~{\rm M_{\odot}~ yr^{-1}}$). Whereas we find that the primary goes into a decades long outburst only when the flyby is retrograde to the circumprimary disc rotation.</description>

      <description>First author: A. Gordon Emslie
We examine the temperature structure of static coronal active region loops in regimes where thermal conductive transport is driven by Coulomb collisions, by turbulent scattering, or by a combination of the two. (In the last case collisional scattering dominates the heat transport at lower levels in the loop where temperatures are low and densities are high, while turbulent scattering dominates the heat transport at higher temperatures/lower densities.</description>

      <description>First author: Mikhail Kovalev
We analyse spectra of 26 early-type stars, with suspected binarity, using a binary spectral model adapted for high-resolution FEROS spectra. We confirm seven SB2 candidates (AE Pic, $\epsilon$ Vol, HD 20784, HD 208433, HD 43519, HD 56024, CD-73~375A) and derive mass ratios and spectroscopic parameters for them. We find good agreement with theoretical models. For slightly evolved system HD 20784 we made the first estimation of the fundamental parameters and age $\log{t}=8.</description>

      <description>First author: Giulio Scelfo
In a General Relativistic framework, Gravitational Waves (GW) and Electromagnetic (EM) waves are expected to respond in the same way to the effects of matter perturbations between the emitter and the observer. A different behaviour might be a signature of alternative theories of gravity. In this work we study the cross-correlation of resolved GW events (from compact objects mergers detected by the Einstein Telescope, either assuming or excluding the detection of an EM counterpart) and EM signals (coming both from the Intensity Mapping of the neutral hydrogen distribution and resolved galaxies from the SKA Observatory), considering weak lensing, angular clustering and their cross term ($\mathrm{L \times C}$) as observable probes.</description>

The Cherenkov Telescope Array will provide the deepest survey of the Galactic Plane performed at very-high-energy gamma-rays. Consequently, this survey will unavoidably face the challenge of source confusion, i.e., the non-unique attribution of signal to a source due to multiple overlapping sources. Among the known populations of Galactic gamma-ray sources and given their extension and number, pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe, and PWN TeV halos) will be the most affected.</description>

With respect to the $\rm H\beta$ full width at half-maximum ($\rm FWHM_{H\beta}$), the broad $\rm H\beta$ line dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$) was preferred as a velocity tracer to calculate the single-epoch supermassive black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) suggested by \cite{Yu2020b}. For a compiled sample of 311 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) with measured hard X-ray photon index ($z&amp;lt;0.7$), $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$ and the optical Fe II relative strength ($R_{\rm Fe}$) are measured from their optical spectra, which are used to calculate $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$-based virial $M_{\rm BH}$ and dimensionless accretion rate ($\dot{\mathscr{M}}$).</description>

There is untapped cosmological information in galaxy redshift surveys in the non-linear regime. In this work, we use the AEMULUS suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations to construct Gaussian process emulators of galaxy clustering statistics at small scales ($0.1-50 : h^{-1},\mathrm{Mpc}$) in order to constrain cosmological and galaxy bias parameters. In addition to standard statistics &amp;ndash; the projected correlation function $w_\mathrm{p}(r_\mathrm{p})$, the redshift-space monopole of the correlation function $\xi_0(s)$, and the quadrupole $\xi_2(s)$ &amp;ndash; we emulate statistics that include information about the local environment, namely the underdensity probability function $P_\mathrm{U}(s)$ and the density-marked correlation function $M(s)$.</description>

      <description>First author: Wenxiu Li
The early evolution of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and black hole mass function (BHMF) encodes key information on the physics determining the radiative and accretion processes of supermassive black holes (BHs) in high-$z$ quasars. Although the QLF shape has been constrained by recent observations, it remains challenging to develop a theoretical model that explains its redshift evolution associated with BH growth self-consistently. In this study, based on a semi-analytical model for the BH formation and growth, we construct the QLF and BHMF of the early BH population that experiences multiple accretion bursts, in each of which a constant Eddington ratio is assigned following a Schechter distribution function.</description>

We report VLBI monitoring observations of the 22 GHz water (H${2}$O) masers around the Mira variable BX Cam, which were carried out as a part of the EAVN Synthesis of Stellar Maser Animations (ESTEMA) project. Data of 37 epochs in total were obtained from 2018 May to 2021 June with a time interval of 3-4 weeks, spanning approximately three stellar pulsation periods ($P= \sim$440 d). In particular, the dual-beam system equipped on the VERA stations was used to measure the kinematics and parallaxes of the H${2}$O maser features.</description>

Gyrochronology can yield useful ages for field main-sequence stars, a regime where other techniques are problematic. Typically, gyrochronology relations are calibrated using young ($\lesssim$ 2 Gyr) clusters, but the constraints at older ages are scarce, making them potentially inaccurate and imprecise. In order to test the performance of current gyrochronology relations, we construct samples of stellar pairs with coeval components, for a range of ages and with available rotation periods.</description>

The resonantly scattered Lyman-$\alpha$ line illuminates the extended halos of neutral hydrogen in the circumgalactic medium of galaxies. We present integral field Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations of double-peaked, spatially extended Ly$\alpha$ emission in 12 relatively low-mass ($M_{\star} \sim10^9 , M_{\odot}$) $z\sim2$ galaxies characterized by extreme nebular emission lines. Using individual spaxels and small bins as well as radially binned profiles of larger regions, we find that for most objects in the sample the Ly$\alpha$ blue-to-red peak ratio increases, the peak separation decreases, and the fraction of flux emerging at line center increases with radius.</description>

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely high-energy events that can be observed at very high redshift. In addition to gamma rays, they can emit in X-ray, optical, and sometimes radio wavelengths. Here, following the approach in Srinivasaragavan et al. (2020); Dainotti et al. (2021b,c), and Dainotti et al (2022, submitted), we consider 82 GRBs from Dainotti et al. (2022a) that have been observed in optical wavelengths and fitted with a broken power law (BPL).</description>

We complement the MALATANG sample of dense gas in nearby galaxies with archival observations of $^{12}\rm CO$ and its isotopologues to determine scaling relations between Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) 12 $\mu$m emission and molecular gas tracers at sub-kiloparsec scales. We find that 12 $\mu$m luminosity is more tightly correlated with $^{12}\rm CO$ than it is with $^{13}\rm CO$ or dense gas tracers. Residuals between predicted and observed $^{12}\rm CO$ are only weakly correlated with molecular gas mass surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm mol}$) in regions where $\Sigma_{\rm mol}$ is very low ($\sim 10~{\rm M_{\odot}~pc^{-2}}$).</description>

We present the first clustering measurement of Strong Blended Lyman $\alpha$ (SBLA) absorption systems by measuring their cross-correlation with the Lyman $\alpha$ forest. SBLAs are a new population of absorbers detected within the Lyman $\alpha$ forest. We find a bias of $2.329\pm0.057$, consistent with that of Damped Lyman $\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs). For DLAs, we recover a bias of $2.331\pm0.057$ larger than previously reported (P&#39;erez-R`afols et al.</description>

Extracting coherent scientific information from these large and multi-modal data sets remains an open issue and data driven approaches such as deep learning have rapidly emerged as a potentially powerful solution to some long lasting challenges. This enthusiasm is reflected in an unprecedented exponential growth of publications using neural networks.</description>

The magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars of the upper main sequence are perfectly suited to studying the effects of rotation, diffusion, mass-loss, accretion, and pulsation in the presence of an organized stellar magnetic field. Therefore, many important models can only be tested with this star group. In this case study we investigate the possibility of detecting the characteristic 520 nm flux depression of mCP stars using low-resolution BP/RP spectra of the Gaia mission.</description>

The nanoflare model of coronal heating is one of the most successful scenarios to explain, within a single framework, the diverse set of coronal observations available with the present instrument resolutions. The model is based on the idea that the coronal structure is formed by elementary magnetic strands which are tangled and twisted by the displacement of their photospheric footpoints by convective motions. These displacements inject magnetic stress between neighbor strands that promotes current sheet formation, reconnection, plasma heating, and possibly also particle acceleration.</description>

As such, their study proves crucial in several areas of contemporary astrophysics, extending to astrobiology.</description>

We present the first survey of quiet Sun features observed in hard X-rays (HXRs), using the the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR), a HXR focusing optics telescope. The recent solar minimum combined with NuSTAR&amp;rsquo;s high sensitivity has presented a unique opportunity to perform the first HXR imaging spectroscopy on a range of features in the quiet Sun. By studying the HXR emission of these features we can detect or constrain the presence of high temperature (&amp;gt;5 MK) or non-thermal sources, to help understand how they relate to larger more energetic solar phenomena, and determine their contribution to heating the solar atmosphere.</description>

We chart the expected Galactic distribution of neutron stars and black holes. These compact remnants of dead stars &amp;ndash; the Galactic underworld &amp;ndash; are found to exhibit a fundamentally different distribution and structure to the visible Galaxy. Compared to the visible Galaxy, concentration into a thin flattened disk structure is much less evident with the scale height more than tripling to 1260 +- 30 pc. This difference arises from two primary causes.</description>

Our current understanding of the cosmic star formation history at z&amp;gt;3 is primarily based on UV-selected galaxies (i.e., LBGs). Recent studies of H-dropouts revealed that we may be missing a large amount of star formation taking place in massive galaxies at z&amp;gt;3. In this work, we extend the H-dropout criterion to lower masses to select optically-dark/faint galaxies (OFGs), in order to complete the census between LBGs and H-dropouts.</description>

The high-ionization mid-IR lines, excited in the Narrow Line Regions (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), barely affected by stellar excitation and dust extinction, trace the AGN bolometric power. We used the complete 12 micron sample of Seyfert galaxies, for which 100/116 objects have reliable 2-10keV observations. The [NeV] and [OIV] mid-IR lines linearly correlate with several AGN bolometric indicators (intrinsic 2-10keV and observed 14-195keV X-ray emission, compact nuclear 12 micron emission, [OIII] 5007A line emission), both in terms of flux and luminosity.</description>

Environment has long been known to have significant impact on the evolution of galaxies, but here we seek to quantify the subtler differences that might be found in disk galaxies, depending on whether they are isolated, the most massive galaxy in a group (centrals), or a lesser member (satellites). The MaNGA survey allows us to define a large mass-matched sample of 574 galaxies with high-quality integrated spectra in each category.</description>

      <description>First author: E. Puzzoni
In the context of particle acceleration in high-energy astrophysical environments featuring magnetic reconnection, the importance of the resistive term of the electric field compared to the convective one is still under debate. In this work, we present a quantitative analysis through 2D magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of tearing-unstable current sheets coupled to a test-particles approach, performed with the PLUTO code. We find that the resistive field plays a significant role in the early-stage energization of high-energy particles.</description>

      <description>First author: Chengyi Wang
Due to the expansion of our Universe, the redshift of distant objects changes with time. Although the amplitude of this redshift drift is small, it will be measurable with a decade-long campaigns on the next generation of telescopes. Here we present an alternative view of the redshift drift which captures the expansion of the universe in single epoch observations of the multiple images of gravitationally lensed sources.</description>

We present results on the morphological and structural evolution of a total of 4265 galaxies observed with JWST at $1.5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 8$ in the JWST CEERS observations that overlap with the CANDELS EGS field. This is the biggest visually classified sample observed with JWST yet, $\sim20$ times larger than previous studies, and allows us to examine in detail how galaxy structure has changed over this critical epoch.</description>

The DAMIC experiment employs large-area, thick charge-coupled devices (CCDs) to search for the interactions of low-mass dark matter particles in the galactic halo with silicon atoms in the CCD target. From 2017 to 2019, DAMIC collected data with a seven-CCD array (40-gram target) installed in the SNOLAB underground laboratory. We report dark-matter search results, including a conspicuous excess of events above the background model below 200 eV$_{\rm ee}$, whose origin remains unknown.</description>

We study the scaling relations between gas-phase metallicity, stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma $), star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma {SFR}$), and molecular gas surface density ($\Sigma{H_2}$) in local star-forming galaxies on scales of a kpc. We employ optical integral field spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey, and ALMA data for a subset of MaNGA galaxies. We use Partial Correlation Coefficients and Random Forest regression to determine the relative importance of local and global galactic properties in setting the gas-phase metallicity.</description>

      <description>First author: Camille Liotine
There are few observed high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) that harbor massive black holes, and none are likely to result in a binary black hole (BBH) that merges within a Hubble time; however, we know that massive merging BBHs exist from gravitational-wave observations. We investigate the role that X-ray and gravitational-wave observational selection effects play in determining the properties of their respective detected binary populations. We confirm that, as a result of selection effects, observable HMXBs and observable BBHs form at different redshifts and metallicities, with observable HMXBs forming at much lower redshifts and higher metallicities than observable BBHs.</description>

Recent studies have revealed the global deposition on Earth of radioactive elements (e.g., $^{60}$Fe) resulting from the metal-enriched ejecta of nearby (within $\sim 100$ pc) supernova explosions. The majority of neutron stars in our Solar neighborhood remain to be discovered. Here we report the discovery of the nearest ($127.7 \pm 0.3$ pc) neutron star candidate in the single-lined spectroscopic binary LAMOST J235456.76+335625.7 (hereafter J2354). Utilizing the multi-epoch spectra and high-cadence periodic light curves, we measure the mass of the visible star ($M_{\rm vis}=0.</description>

Observational studies of AGN in the mid-infrared regime are crucial to our understanding of AGN and their role in the evolution of galaxies. Mid-IR-based selection of AGN is complementary to more traditional techniques allowing for a more complete census of AGN activity across cosmic time. Mid-IR observations including time variability and spatially resolved imaging have given us unique insights into the nature of the obscuring structures around AGN.</description>

We measure and compare the pattern speeds of vertical breathing, vertical bending, and spiral density waves in two isolated N-body+SPH simulations, using windowed Fourier transforms over 1 Gyr time intervals. We show that the pattern speeds of the breathing waves match those of the spirals but are different from those of the bending waves. We also observe matching pattern speeds between the bar and breathing waves.</description>

A series of dynamical anomalies in the orbits of distant trans-Neptunian objects points to a new celestial body (usually named Planet Nine) in the solar system. In this draft, we point out that a mirror planet captured from the outer solar system or formed in the solar system is also a possible candidate. The introduction of the mirror matter model is due to an unbroken parity symmetry and is a potential explanation for dark matter.</description>

It was suggested that the prominent feature of the optical Fe II emission has a connection with the accretion process in active galactic nuclei (AGN). For a large sample of 4037 quasars ($z &amp;lt; 0.8$) with measured $\rm H\beta$ line dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and 120 compiled reverberation-mapped (RM) AGN, we use $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$ and the extended $R_{\rm BLR}-L_{\rm 5100}$ relation to calculate supermassive black holes masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) from the single-epoch spectra for the SDSS subsample, and $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$ from the mean spectra for the RM subsample.</description>

      <description>First author: A. Ristea
Misalignments between the rotation axis of stars and gas are an indication of external processes shaping galaxies throughout their evolution. Using observations of 3068 galaxies from the SAMI Galaxy Survey, we compute global kinematic position angles for 1445 objects with reliable kinematics and identify 169 (12%) galaxies which show stellar-gas misalignments. Kinematically decoupled features are more prevalent in early-type/passive galaxies compared to late-type/star-forming systems. Star formation is the main source of gas ionisation in only 22% of misaligned galaxies; 17% are Seyfert objects, while 61% show Low-Ionisation Nuclear Emission-line Region features.</description>

Context. The occultation of a radio source by the plasma tail of a comet can be used to probe structure and dynamics in the tail. Such occultations are rare, and the occurrence of scintillation, due to small-scale density variations in the tail, remains somewhat controversial. Aims. A detailed observation taken with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) of a serendipitous occultation of the compact radio source 3C196 by the plasma tail of comet C/2020 F3 (Neowise) is presented.</description>

Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of Galactic molecular clouds is important for understanding how clouds are affected by processes such as turbulence and magnetic fields and how this structure effects star formation within them. Great progress has been made in this field with the arrival of the Gaia mission, which provides accurate distances to $\sim10^{9}$ stars. Combining these distances with extinctions inferred from optical-IR, we recover the three-dimensional structure of 16 Galactic molecular cloud complexes at $\sim1$pc resolution using our novel three-dimensional dust mapping algorithm \texttt{Dustribution}.</description>

Supernovae (SNe), kilonovae (KNe), tidal disruption events (TDEs), optical afterglows of gamma ray bursts (GRBs), and many other optical transients are important phenomena in time-domain astronomy. Fitting the multi-band light curves (LCs) or the synthesized (pseudo-)bolometric LCs can be used to constrain the physical properties of optical transients. The (UV absorbed) blackbody module is one of the most important modules used to fit the multi-band LCs of optical transients having (UV absorbed) blackbody spectral energy distributions (SEDs).</description>

When did the first galaxies form?&#39;&#39; is still one of the greatest unanswered questions in astronomy. Theory and current stellar population models imply that the first galaxies formed at least at z=14-15. Yet, the highest redshift galaxy to have been securely confirmed remains GN-z11, at z$\sim$11. The galaxy HD1&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; was recently proposed to be a z=13.27 galaxy based on its potential Lyman break and tentative [O III] 88 {\mu}m detection with ALMA.</description>

The erratic spin history of Vela X-1 shows some continuous spin-up/spin-down trend over tens of days. We study the orbital profile and spectral property of Vela X-1 in these spin-up/spin-down intervals, using the spin history monitored by Fermi/GBM and light curve from Swift/BAT and MAXI/GSC. The BAT fluxes in the spin-up intervals are about 1.6 times those of the spin-down intervals for out-of-eclipse orbital phases. The spin-up intervals also show a higher column density than the spin-down intervals, indicating there are more material on the orbital scale for the spin-up intervals.</description>

We present a statistical analysis of the properties of the obscuring material around active galactic nuclei (AGN). This study represents the first of its kind for an ultra-hard X-ray (14-195keV; Swift/BAT) volume-limited (DL&amp;lt;40 Mpc) sample of 24 Seyfert (Sy) galaxies (BCS40 sample) using high angular resolution infrared data and various torus models: smooth, clumpy and two-phase torus models and clumpy disc+wind models. We find that the smooth, clumpy and two-phase torus models (i.</description>

      <description>First author: Alessandro Montanari
Indirect detection opens a unique window for probing thermal dark matter (DM): the same annihilation process that determined the relic abundance in the early Universe drives the present day astrophysical signal. While TeV-scale particles weakly coupled to the Standard Model face undoubted challenges from decades of null searches, the scenario remains compelling, and simple realizations such as Higgsino DM remain largely unexplored. The fate of such scenarios could be determined by gamma-ray observations of the centre of the Milky Way with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs).</description>

We analyze the complete chain of effects caused by a solar eruptive event in order to better understand the dynamic evolution of magnetic-field related quantities in interplanetary space, in particular that of magnetic flux and helicity. We study a series of connected events (a confined C4.5 flare, a flare-less filament eruption and a double-peak M-class flare) that originated in NOAA active region (AR) 12891 on 2021 November 1 and November 2.</description>

      <description>First author: Razieh Emami
We investigate general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations (GRMHD) to determine the physical origin of the twisty patterns of linear polarization seen in spatially resolved black hole images and explain their morphological dependence on black hole spin. By characterising the observed emission with a simple analytic ring model, we find that the twisty morphology is determined by the magnetic field structure in the emitting region. Moreover, the dependence of this twisty pattern on spin can be attributed to changes in the magnetic field geometry that occur due to the frame dragging.</description>

We measure abundances of 12 elements (Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) in a sample of 86 metal-poor ($-2 \lesssim \text{[Fe/H]} \lesssim -1$) subgiant stars in the solar neighborhood. Abundances are derived from high-resolution spectra taken with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument on the Large Binocular Telescope, modeled using iSpec and MOOG.

      <description>First author: Emil Kundra
The post-common envelope binary V471 Tauri has been an object of interest for decades. V471 Tau shows various phenomena due to its evolutionary state and unique properties, e.g. its magnetic accretion and eclipse timing variation (ETV). Previous authors explained the ETVs by different, sometimes contradictory theories. In this paper, we present and analyse the variability of the eclipse timing of this star. We observed V471 Tauri over the last ten years and covered the second cycle of its period variation.</description>

High-resolution imaging is crucial for exploring the origin and mechanism of radio emission in quasars, especially at high redshifts. We present 1.5 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images of the radio continuum emission from the radio-intermediate quasar (RIQ) J2242+0334 at $z = 5.9$. This object was previously detected at both 1.5 GHz and 3 GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) as a point source.</description>

      <description>First author: Morifumi Mizuno
Universe&amp;rsquo;s matter inhomogeneity gravitationally affects the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs), causing the lensing effect. Particularly, the weak lensing of GWs contains abundance of information about the small scale matter power spectrum and it has been studied within the range of the Born approximation. In this work, we investigate the validity of the Born approximation by accounting for the higher order terms in the gravitational potential $\Phi$.</description>

      <description>First author: Adélie Gorce
Combining the visibilities measured by an interferometer to form a cosmological power spectrum is a complicated process in which the window functions play a crucial role. In a delay-based analysis, the mapping between instrumental space, made of per-baseline delay spectra, and cosmological space is not a one-to-one relation. Instead, neighbouring modes contribute to the power measured at one point, with their respective contributions encoded in the window functions.</description>

      <description>First author: Michal Bílek
Context: Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are divided into slow and fast rotators (FRs and SRs) according to the degree of ordered rotation of their stellar populations. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations indicate that galaxies are formed as FRs before their rotational support decreases, usually because of mergers. Aims: We aimed to investigate this process observationally for galaxies outside of clusters. Methods: We made use of the fact that different merger types leave different traces that have different lifetimes.</description>

Context. The physical state of most of the baryonic matter in the local universe is unknown, which is commonly referred to as the ``missing baryon problem&amp;quot;. It is theorized that at least half of these missing baryons are in a warm-hot, low-density phase outside of the virialized dark-matter halos. Aims. We make an attempt to find the signature of this warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) phase in the filaments of the nearby Virgo cluster by using optical and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect data.</description>

We use the Magneticum suite of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations to identify cosmic voids based on the watershed technique and investigate their most fundamental properties across different resolutions in mass and scale. This encompasses the distributions of void sizes, shapes, and content, as well as their radial density and velocity profiles traced by the distribution of cold dark matter particles and halos. We also study the impact of various tracer properties, such as their sparsity and mass, and the influence of void merging on these summary statistics.</description>

SMACS~J0723.3-7327 is the first galaxy cluster lens observed by JWST. Based on the ERO data from JWST, several groups have reported the results on strong lensing analysis and mass distribution of this cluster. However, limited by the angular coverage of the JWST data, the strong lensing models only cover the central region. X-ray analysis on the hot ICM is necessary to obtain a more complete constraint on the mass distribution in this very massive cluster.</description>

Ark 564 is an extreme high-Eddington Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, known for being one of the brightest, most rapidly variable soft X-ray AGN, and for having one of the lowest temperature coronae. Here we present a 410-ks NuSTAR observation and two 115-ks XMM-Newton observations of this unique source, which reveal a very strong, relativistically broadened iron line. We compute the Fourier-resolved time lags by first using Gaussian processes to interpolate the NuSTAR gaps, implementing the first employment of multi-task learning for application in AGN timing.</description>

      <description>First author: Y. Omiya
CIZA J1358.9-4750 is a nearby galaxy cluster in the early phase of a major merger. The two-dimensional temperature map using XMM-Newton EPIC-PN observation confirms the existence of a high temperature region, which we call the &amp;ldquo;hot region&amp;rdquo;, in the &amp;ldquo;bridge region&amp;rdquo; connecting the two clusters. The ~ 500 kpc wide region between the southeast and northwest boundaries also has higher pseudo pressure compared to the unshocked regions, suggesting the existence of two shocks.</description>
