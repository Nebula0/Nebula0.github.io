Almost all massive galaxies today are understood to contain supermassive black holes (SMBH) at their centers. SMBHs grew by accreting material from their surroundings, emitting X-rays as they did so. X-ray Luminosity Functions (XLFs) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have been extensively studied in order to understand the AGN population&amp;rsquo;s cosmological properties and evolution. We present a new fixed rest-frame method to achieve a more accurate study of the AGN XLF evolution over cosmic time.</description>

We present the results of determining the coordinates of the vertices of various stellar systems, the centroids of which are located in the Galactic plane. To do this, the positions, parallaxes, proper motions, and radial velocities of red giants and subgiants contained in the Gaia DR3 catalogue have been used. When determining the components of the deformation velocity tensors in local coordinate systems, we found the coordinates of the vertices of the stellar systems under study.</description>

      <description>First author: Sarvesh Gharat
In today&amp;rsquo;s era, a tremendous amount of data is generated by different observatories and manual classification of data is something which is practically impossible. Hence, to classify and categorize the objects there are multiple machine and deep learning techniques used. However, these predictions are overconfident and won&amp;rsquo;t be able to identify if the data actually belongs to the trained class. To solve this major problem of overconfidence, in this study we propose a novel Bayesian Neural Network which randomly samples weights from a distribution as opposed to the fixed weight vector considered in the frequentist approach.</description>

      <description>First author: Jed McKinney
Selecting the first galaxies at z&amp;gt;7-10 from JWST surveys is complicated by z&amp;lt;6 contaminants with degenerate photometry. For example, strong optical nebular emission lines at z&amp;lt;6 may mimic JWST/NIRCam photometry of z&amp;gt;7-10 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). Dust-obscured 3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 galaxies in particular are potentially important contaminants, and their faint rest-optical spectra have been historically difficult to observe. A lack of optical emission line and continuum measures for 3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6 dusty galaxies now makes it difficult to test their expected JWST/NIRCam photometry for degenerate solutions with NIRCam dropouts.</description>

We present results from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Survey (CEERS) on the stellar-population parameters for 28 galaxies with redshifts $4&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;9$ using imaging data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) combined with data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The JWST/MIRI 5.6 and 7.7 $\mu$m data extend the coverage of the rest-frame spectral-energy distribution (SED) to nearly 1 micron for galaxies in this redshift range.</description>

Redshift measurement has always been a constant need in modern astronomy and cosmology. And as new surveys have been providing an immense amount of data on astronomical objects, the need to process such data automatically proves to be increasingly necessary. In this article, we use simulated data from the Dark Energy Survey, and from a pipeline originally created to classify supernovae, we developed a linear regression algorithm optimized through novel automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks achieving an error score better than ordinary data pre-processing methods when compared with other modern algorithms (such as XGBOOST).</description>

      <description>Ivan de Martino
We use the kinematic data of the stars in eight dwarf spheroidal galaxies to assess whether $f(R)$ gravity can fit the observed profiles of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of these systems without resorting to dark matter. Our model assumes that each galaxy is spherically symmetric and has a constant velocity anisotropy parameter $β$ and constant mass-to-light ratio consistent with stellar population synthesis models. We solve the spherical Jeans equation that includes the Yukawa-like gravitational potential appearing in the weak field limit of $f(R)$ gravity, and a Plummer density profile for the stellar distribution.</description>

      <description>First author: Li-Yuan Lu
The extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) represents the cool/warm ionized gas reservoir around galaxies. We present a spatial analysis of H$\alpha$ images of 22 nearby edge-on spiral galaxies from the CHANG-ES sample (the eDIG-CHANGES project), taken with the APO 3.5m telescope, in order to study their eDIG. We conduct an exponential fit to the vertical intensity profiles of the sample galaxies, of which 16 can be decomposed into a thin disk plus an extended thick disk component.</description>

      <description>First author: Juhan Kim
We investigate the impact of the surface brightness (SB) limit on the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) using mock surveys generated from the Horizon Run 5 (HR5) simulation. We compare the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, GSMF, and size-stellar mass relation of the HR5 galaxies with empirical data and other cosmological simulations. The mean SB of simulated galaxies are computed using their effective radii, luminosities, and colors. To examine the cosmic SB dimming effect, we compute $k$-corrections from the spectral energy distributions of individual simulated galaxy at each redshift, apply the $k$-corrections to the galaxies, and conduct mock surveys based on the various SB limits.</description>

      <description>First author: M. A. Abdulrahman
For spiral galaxies, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and some physical parameters that concern the host galaxy such as spiral arm radius and density can play an important role in the morphological evolution of these galaxies. Considering the gravitational effect of the central black hole as a feeding mechanism, the gas flows from spiral arms to the accretion disk. Accordingly, we constructed our approach and derived an equation for the AGN luminosity that depends on parameters such as the black hole mass and the spiral arm density.</description>

We review the recent observations of protoplanetary disks together with relevant theoretical studies with an emphasis on the evolution of volatiles. In the last several years Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) provided evidence of grain growth, gas-dust decoupling, and sub-structures such as rings and gaps in the dust continuum. Molecular line observations revealed radial and vertical distributions of molecular abundances and also provided significant constraints on the gas dynamics such as turbulence.</description>

      <description>First author: Hsinhao Huang
Wave (fuzzy) dark matter consists of ultralight bosons ($m \sim 10^{-22} \textrm{&amp;ndash;} 10^{-20},{\rm eV}$), featuring a compact solitonic core at the centre of a granular halo. Here we extend this model to a two-component wave dark matter, with distinct particle masses and coupled only through gravity, and investigate the resulting soliton-halo structure via cosmological simulations. Specifically, we assume wave dark matter contains $75$ per cent major component and $25$ per cent minor component, fix the major-component particle mass to $m_{\rm major}=1\times10^{-22},{\rm eV}$, and explore two different minor-component particle masses with $m_{\rm major}:m_{\rm minor}=3:1$ and $1:3$, respectively.</description>

We present a new description of cosmological evolution of the primordial magnetic field under the condition that it is non-helical and its energy density is larger than the kinetic energy density. We argue that the evolution can be described by four different regimes, according to whether the decay dynamics is linear or not, and whether the dominant dissipation term is the shear viscosity or the drag force.</description>

Calcium-rich supernovae (Ca-rich SNe) are faint, rapidly evolving transients whose progenitor system is yet to be determined. We derive the $\gamma$-ray deposition histories of five Ca-rich SNe from the literature in order to place constraints on possible progenitor systems. We find that the $ \gamma $-ray escape time, $ t_0 $, of the Ca-rich SNe sample is $\approx35$-$65 ,\rm{d}$, within the unoccupied region between Type Ia SNe and stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe).</description>

The volcanism plays an important part in mass exchange circle to bring matter from core of planet to atmosphere. Thus, it is a possible method to research the change of elements abundance in atmosphere by modeling the process of volatiles from volcanism get through and mix in atmosphere, which is the focused point of this article. This article penetrates from the generation of volatiles, talks the species, mass, and mole fractions of different typical elements in magma.</description>

      <description>M. Mezcua,
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to originate from early Universe seed black holes of mass $M_\mathrm{BH} \sim 10^2$-10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$ and grown through cosmic time. Such seeds could be powering the active galactic nuclei (AGN) found in today&amp;amp;#39;s dwarf galaxies. However, probing a connection between the early seeds and local SMBHs has not yet been observationally possible. Massive black holes hosted in dwarf galaxies at intermediate redshifts, on the other hand, may represent the evolved counterparts of the seeds formed at very early times.</description>

      <description>Rune Strandberg
When the quality of multijunction solar cells becomes sufficiently high, radiative exchange of photons between cells has to be taken into account to properly model these devices. In this work it is shown how this radiative coupling can be accounted for in series connected multi-junction solar cells by constants called transfer coefficients. Under the assumption that the exchanged radiation only travels one way, from higher to lower band gaps, the transfer coefficients allows the relation between the voltage and current of the device to be expressed by a convenient mathematical expression.</description>

Using radiation-hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, we present a detailed ($0.1$ pc resolution), physically motivated portrait of a typical-mass dwarf galaxy before the epoch of reionization, resolving the formation and evolution of star clusters into individual $10:\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ star particles. In the rest-frame UV, the galaxy has an irregular morphology with no bulge or galactic disk, dominated by light emitted from numerous, compact, and gravitationally-bound star clusters.</description>

      <description>First author: Jessica A. Cowell
The assumption of isotropy &amp;ndash; that the Universe looks the same in all directions on large scales &amp;ndash; is fundamental to the standard cosmological model. This model forms the building blocks of essentially all of our cosmological knowledge to date. It is therefore critical to empirically test in which regimes its core assumptions hold. Anisotropies in the cosmic expansion are expected on small scales due to nonlinear structures in the late Universe, however, the extent to which these anisotropies might impact our low-redshift observations remains to be fully tested.</description>

${\rm H}_2$ detections are usually biased towards star-forming galaxies, whose low number statistics in clusters has led to contradictory results in the literature regarding the impact of environment on their ${\rm H}_2$ content, across redshifts. In this work, we employ the EAGLE simulation to investigate the relationship between the ${\rm H}2$ content of star-forming galaxies and their environment for redshifts spanning $0\leq z\leq 1$. To do so, we divide the sample into those that are bound to clusters and those that are not.</description>

We examine star formation and chemical enrichment in protoclusters (PCs) using cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the total star formation rate (SFR) in all PC ($&amp;gt;10^{14.4},h^{-1}$~M$\odot$) reaches $&amp;gt;10^4,\mathrm{M}\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, at $z=3$, equivalent to the observed PCs. The SFR in the Core region accounts for about $30%$ of the total star formation in the PC at $z\gtrsim1$, suggesting the importance of the outer regions to reveal the evolution of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <description>First author: Xiang-Cun Meng
Although type Ia supernovae are so important in many astrophysical field, e.g. in cosmology, their explosion mechanism and progenitor system are still unclear. In physics, the relative equivalent width (REW) of the Si II 635.5 nm absorption feature reflects the velocity interval of silicon in the supernova ejecta and then may provide constraints on the explosion mechanism of SNe Ia. In this paper, we divide the SNe Ia into broad line (BL) and normal line (NL) subsamples based on their REW of Si II 635.</description>

Satellite galaxies undergo a variety of physical processes when they are accreted by groups and clusters, often resulting in the loss of baryonic and dark matter (DM) mass. In this work, we evaluate the predictions from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation regarding the evolution of the matter content of satellites, focusing on a population that are accreted at $z&amp;gt;1$ and retain their identity as satellites down to $z=0$.</description>

      <description>First author: Eleonora Di Valentino
We present strong model-marginalized limits on mixed hot dark matter scenarios, which consider both thermal neutrinos and thermal QCD axions. A novel aspect of our analyses is the inclusion of small-scale Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT), together with those from the Planck satellite and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data. After marginalizing over a number of well-motivated non-minimal background cosmologies, the tightest $95%$ CL upper bound we obtain is $0.</description>

      <description>First author: Themiya Nanayakkara
The confirmation of the presence of very massive quiescent galaxies at epochs only 1-2 Gyr after the Big Bang $[1-8]$ has challenged models of cosmology and galaxy formation $[9]$. Producing sufficient numbers of these requires abundant numbers of the host dark matter halos to have been assembled and sufficient time for star formation to proceed extremely quickly and then cease just as rapidly. Ground-based spectroscopy has suggested ages of 200-300 Myr$[3]$ at redshifts $3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4$.</description>

      <description>First author: Ryan D. Boyden
The stellar cluster environment is expected to play a central role in the evolution of circumstellar disks. We use thermochemical modeling to constrain the dust and gas masses, disk sizes, UV and X-ray radiation fields, viewing geometries, and central stellar masses of 20 Class II disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We fit a large grid of disk models to $350$ GHz continuum, CO $J=3-2$, and HCO$^+$ $J=4-3$ ALMA observations of each target, and we introduce a procedure for modeling interferometric observations of gas disks detected in absorption against a bright molecular cloud background.</description>

An increase in satellite application has skyrocketed the number of satellites, especially in the low earth orbit (LEO). The major concern today is that these satellites become debris after the end of life, negatively affecting the space environment. As per the International Guidelines of the European Space Agency, it is mandatory to deorbit the satellite within 25 years of its end of life. This paper is aimed to design the solid chemical propellant thruster to deorbit the StudSat II from its original orbit to the lower orbit.</description>

Cosmic rays are relativistic particles that come to the Earth from outer space. Despite a great effort made in both experimental and theoretical research, their origin is still unknown. One of the main keys to understand their nature is the determination of its chemical composition as a function of primary energy. In this paper, we review the measurements of the mass composition above $10^{15}$ eV.</description>

We develop a method to identify and determine the physical properties of stellar associations using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) NUV-U-B-V-I imaging of nearby galaxies from the PHANGS-HST survey. We apply a watershed algorithm to density maps constructed from point source catalogues Gaussian smoothed to multiple physical scales from 8 to 64 pc. We develop our method on two galaxies that span the distance range in the PHANGS-HST sample: NGC 3351 (10 Mpc), NGC 1566 (18 Mpc).</description>

      <description>First author: Maokai Hu
Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD) and are well-known as a distance indicator. However, it is still unclear how WDs increase their mass near the Chandrasekhar limit and how the thermonuclear runaway happens. The observational clues associated with these open questions, such as the photometric data within hours to days since the explosion, are scarce. Thus, an essential way is to discover SNe Ia at specific epochs with optimal surveys.</description>

Using $\lambda$-21-cm galactic neutral atomic hydrogen data from the HI4PI survey of Bekhti et al. (2016) and 0.75-30 MeV $\gamma$-ray emission from the Imaging Compton Telescope, we have searched for the origin event that accelerated high velocity cloud Complex M. Radio plots of $l-b$, $l-v$, and $b-v$ show a cavity centered at ($l$, $b$) $\sim$ (150$^{\circ}$, 50.$^{\circ}$) and extending about $\pm$33$^{\circ}$. The best view of the cavity is at a velocity of -25 km s$^{-1}$, which shows a circular cross section on the back (receding) face.</description>

The presence of radioactive $^{26}$Al at 1.8 MeV reflects ongoing nucleosynthesis in the Milky Way. Diffuse emission from its decay can be measured with gamma-ray telescopes in space. The intensity, line shape, and spatial distribution of the $^{26}$Al emission allow a study of these nucleosynthesis sources. The line parameters trace massive-star feedback in the interstellar medium due to its 1~My lifetime. We aim to deepen previous studies of the $^{26}$Al emission in the Milky Way, using all gamma-ray data including single and double events as collected with SPI on INTEGRAL from 2003 until 2020.</description>

      <description>First author: J. ZuHone
The number density of galaxy clusters as a function of mass and redshift is a sensitive function of the cosmological parameters. To use clusters for cosmological parameter studies, it is necessary to determine their masses as accurately as possible, which is typically done via mass-observable scaling relations. X-ray observables can be biased by multiphase gas and projection effects, especially in the case where cluster temperatures and luminosities are estimated from single-model fits to all of the emission with a given radius.</description>

We predict the dwarf galaxy detection limits for the upcoming Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) survey that will cover 17,500 deg$^{2}$ of the sky with a wide field of view of 1.1 deg$^2$. The point-source depth reaches 26.3 mag in the $g$ band and 25.9 mag in the $i$ band. Constructing mock survey data based on the designed photometric bands, we estimate the recovery rate of artificial dwarf galaxies from mock point-source photometric catalogues.</description>

Bars play an important role in mixing material in the inner regions of galaxies and stimulating radial migration. Previous observations have found evidence for the impact of a bar on metallicity gradients but the effect is still inconclusive. We use the TYPHOON/PrISM survey to investigate the metallicity gradients along and beyond the bar region across the entire star-forming disk of five nearby galaxies. Using emission line diagrams to identify star-forming spaxels, we recover the global metallicity gradients ranging from -0.</description>

JWST observations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission provide some of the deepest and highest resolution views of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) in nearby galaxies. If PAHs are well mixed with the atomic and molecular gas and illuminated by the average diffuse interstellar radiation field, PAH emission may provide an approximately linear, high resolution, high sensitivity tracer of diffuse gas surface density. We present a pilot study that explores using PAH emission in this way based on MIRI observations of IC 5332, NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 from the PHANGS-JWST Treasury.</description>

We present direct constraints on galaxy intrinsic alignments using the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3), the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and its precursor, the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Our measurements incorporate photometric red sequence (redMaGiC) galaxies from DES with median redshift $z\sim0.2-1.0$, luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from eBOSS at $z\sim0.8$, and also a SDSS-III BOSS CMASS sample at $z\sim0.5$. We measure two point intrinsic alignment correlations, which we fit using a model that includes lensing, magnification and photometric redshift error.</description>

We present the Cosmological Double Radio Active Galactic Nuclei (CosmoDRAGoN) project: a large suite of simulated AGN jets in cosmological environments. These environments sample the intra-cluster media of galaxy clusters that form in cosmological smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, which we then use as inputs for grid-based hydrodynamic simulations of radio jets. Initially conical jets are injected with a range of jet powers, speeds (both relativistic and non-relativistic), and opening angles; we follow their collimation and propagation on scales of tens to hundreds of kiloparsecs, and calculate spatially-resolved synthetic radio spectra in post-processing.</description>

We present a review of the topics of X-ray stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) and changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGN). Stars approaching a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can be tidally disrupted and accreted. TDEs were first discovered in the X-ray regime and appear as luminous, giant-amplitude flares from inactive galaxies. The early X-ray observations with ROSAT also established the extreme X-ray spectral softness of these events with temperatures of order 50-100 eV that continues to be seen in the majority of more recently identified events.</description>

With the development of a series of Galaxy sky surveys in recent years, the observations increased rapidly, which makes the research of machine learning methods for galaxy image recognition a hot topic. Available automatic galaxy image recognition researches are plagued by the large differences in similarity between categories, the imbalance of data between different classes, and the discrepancy between the discrete representation of Galaxy classes and the essentially gradual changes from one morphological class to the adjacent class (DDRGC).</description>

The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a source of hydrodynamic turbulence that can drive vigorous vertical mixing and moderate levels of accretion in protoplanetary disks, and it could be observable in the near future. With high-resolution three-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics simulations, we modeled the behavior of the VSI in protoplanetary disks with and without embedded planets. We then measured its accretion and mixing capabilities by comparing the full Reynolds stress, which includes the contribution of nonaxisymmetric features, such as spiral arms and vortices, to the Reynolds stress due to the azimuthally averaged velocity field, which can be attributed to good approximation to the VSI.</description>

Galaxies in cosmic voids have been reported with properties related to a delayed evolution with respect to the Universe in general. These characteristics reflect the interaction of galaxies with the environment. However, it is not clear the degree of influence of the large-scale structure on the properties of void galaxies or, if these are only influenced by the low local density around them typical of these regions.</description>

      <description>First author: F. Ubertosi
Using $\sim$427 ks of Chandra observations, we present a study of shock heating and ICM cooling in the galaxy cluster RBS 797. We discover three nested pairs of weak shocks at roughly 50 kpc, 80 kpc and 130 kpc from the center. The total energy associated with the shocks is $\sim6\times10^{61}$ erg, with the central AGN driving a pair of weak shocks every 20-30 Myr with a power $P_{sh}\approx10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>First author: R. Seppi
The characterization of the dynamical state of clusters is key to study their evolution, their selection, and use them as a cosmological probe. The offsets between different definitions of the center have been used to estimate the cluster disturbance. Our goal is to study the distribution of the offset between the X-ray and optical centers in clusters of galaxies. We study the offset for eROSITA clusters.</description>

The remnant phase of a radio galaxy is characterized by the cessation of AGN activity resulting in the stoppage of jets supplying plasma to radio lobes. In this paper, we present the search and characterization of remnant candidates in 12.5 deg$^{2}$ of the {\em XMM$-$Newton} Large$-$Scale Structure (XMM$-$LSS) field by using deep radio observations at 325 MHz from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), at 150 MHz from the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), at 1.</description>

      <description>First author: M. G. del Valle-Espinosa
Nearby metal-poor starburst dwarf galaxies present a unique opportunity to probe the physics of high-density star formation with a detail and sensitivity unmatched by any observation of the high-z Universe. Here we present the first results from a chemodynamical study of the nearby, gas-rich starburst dwarf CGCG 007-025. We use VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy to characterise the properties of the star-forming (SF) gas, from its metal content to its kinematics.</description>

      <description>First author: C. T. Donnan
We utilise JWST NIRCam medium-band imaging to search for extreme redshift ($z \geq 9.5$) galaxy candidates in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) and the additional pointing within the GOODS-South field provided by the second NIRCam module. Our search reveals 6 robust candidates, 3 of which have recently been spectroscopically confirmed. One of these 3 is the previously controversial $z \simeq 12$ galaxy candidate UDF-22980 which is now detected in five JWST NIRCam medium-band filters (F182M, F210M, F430M, F460M and F480M), efficiently excluding alternative low-redshift solutions and allowing us to now report a secure photometric redshift of $z = 11.</description>

We study the relation between halo concentration and mass (c-M relation) using the Seventh and Eighth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR7 and DR8) galaxy catalogue. Assuming that the satellite galaxies follow the distribution of dark matter, we derive the halo concentration by fitting the satellite radial profile with a Nararro Frank and White (NFW) format. The derived c-M relation covers a wide halo mass range from $10^{11.</description>

      <description>First author: Emily Frank
Red geysers are a specific type of quiescent galaxy, denoted by twin jets emerging from their galactic centers. These bisymmetric jets possibly inject energy and heat into the surrounding material, effectively suppressing star formation by stabilizing cool gas. In order to confirm the presence and evolutionary consequences of these jets, this paper discusses the scaling, stacking, and conversion of 21-cm HI flux data sourced from the HI-MaNGA survey into HI gas-to-stellar mass (G/S) spectra.</description>

      <description>First author: Nancy Yang
The gas-phase metallicity of galaxies encodes important information about galaxy evolution processes, in particular star formation, feedback, outflows and gas accretion, the relative importance of which can be extracted from systematic trends in the scatter of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR). Here, we use a sample of low redshift (0.02&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.055) galaxies from SDSS to investigate the nature of the scatter around the MZR, the observables and physical processes causing it, and its dependence on galaxy mass.</description>

We investigate the role of galaxy mergers on supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion and star formation quenching in three state-of-the-art cosmological simulations with contrasting physics models: EAGLE, Illustris and IllustrisTNG. We find that recently coalesced &amp;lsquo;post-mergers&amp;rsquo; in all three simulations have elevated SMBH accretion rates by factors of ~2-5. However, rapid (within 500 Myr of coalescence) quenching of star formation is rare, with incidence rates of 0.</description>

We present a machine-learning framework to accurately characterize morphologies of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) host galaxies within $z&amp;lt;1$. We first use PSFGAN to decouple host galaxy light from the central point source, then we invoke the Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) to estimate whether the host galaxy is disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, or indeterminate. Using optical images from five bands of the HSC Wide Survey, we build models independently in three redshift bins: low $(0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.</description>

Motivated by observational results, we use hydrodynamical numerical simulations to study the alignment of the central galaxies in groups with the surrounding structures. This approach allows us to analyse galaxy and group properties not available in observations. To perform this analysis, we use a modified version of the two-point cross-correlation function and a measure of the angle between the semi-major axes of the central galaxies and the larger structures.</description>

In this paper we present CALSAGOS: Clustering ALgorithmS Applied to Galaxies in Overdense Systems which is a PYTHON package developed to select cluster members and to search, find, and identify substructures. CALSAGOS is based on clustering algorithms and was developed to be used in spectroscopic and photometric samples. To test the performance of CALSAGOS we use the S-PLUS&amp;rsquo;s mock catalogues and we found an error of 1% - 6% on member selection depending on the function that is used.</description>

We combine these with the CO(2-1) data from PHANGS-ALMA, and literature $[CI]$ and CO data for two other starburst and/or active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies (NGC1808, NGC7469), to study: a) the spatial distributions of CI and CO emission; b) the observed line ratio RCICO = I_$[CI]$(1-0)/I_CO(2-1) as a function of various galactic properties; and c) the abundance ratio of $[CI/CO]$.</description>

This is arguably the first such study to approach the scales of individual massive molecular clouds ($M_{\rm mol} \gtrsim 10^{5.3}$ M$_{\odot}$). Using the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC), we identify 63 SNe within the PHANGS-ALMA footprint.</description>

Spatial curvature is one of the most fundamental parameters in our current concordance flat $\Lambda$CDM model of the Universe.

      <description>First author: Nicholas Fraser Boardman
The gas metallicity distributions across individual galaxies and across galaxy samples can teach us much about how galaxies evolve. Massive galaxies typically possess negative metallicity gradients, and mass and metallicity are tightly correlated on local scales over wide range of galaxy masses; however, the precise origins of such trends remain elusive. Here, we employ data from SDSS-IV MaNGA to explore how gas metallicity depends on local stellar mass density and on galactocentric radius within individual galaxies.</description>

To understand the effects of the cluster environment to the evolution of galaxies, we compare across the five classes: stellar mass, specific star formation rate, size, and morphology.</description>

We study the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) for matter density averaged over spherical cells. The leading part to the PDF is defined by the dynamics of the spherical collapse whereas the next-to-leading part comes from the integration over fluctuations around the saddle-point solution. The latter calculation receives sizable contributions from unphysical short modes and must be renormalized. We propose a new approach to renormalization by modeling the effective stress-energy tensor for short perturbations.</description>

We present TXPipe, a modular, automated and reproducible pipeline for generating data vectors in cosmology analyses. The pipeline is developed within the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), and designed for cosmology analyses using LSST data. In this paper, we present the pipeline for the so-called 3$\times$2pt analysis - a combination of three two-point functions that measure the auto- and cross-correlation between galaxy density and shapes.</description>

We analyze the late time evolution of 12 supernovae (SNe) occurring over the last ${\sim}$41 years, including nine Type IIP/L, two IIb, and one Ib/c, using UBVR optical data from the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) and difference imaging. We see late time (5 to 42 years) emission from nine of the eleven Type II SNe (eight Type IIP/L, one IIb). We consider radioactive decay, circumstellar medium (CSM) interactions, pulsar/engine driven emission, dust echoes, and shock perturbed binary companions as possible sources of emission.</description>

The early-type galaxy NGC 5195 (alternatively known as M51b) possesses extended gas features detected in multi-wavelength, postulated to be associated with previous activities of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Using integral field spectroscopic observations from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)/SITELLE, we report on the discovery of a new large-scale ionized gas structure traced by $[O III]$, $[N II]$, and H$\alpha$ line emission, extending to $\sim10\rm,kpc$ from the nucleus of NGC 5195.</description>

Modeling the growth histories of specific galaxies often involves generating the entire population of objects that arise in a given cosmology and selecting systems with appropriate properties. This approach is highly inefficient when targeting rare systems such as the extremely luminous high-redshift galaxy candidates detected by JWST. Here, we present a novel framework for generating merger trees with branches that are guaranteed to achieve a desired halo mass at a chosen redshift.</description>

Machine learning techniques that perform morphological classification of astronomical sources often suffer from a scarcity of labelled training data. Here, we focus on the case of supervised deep learning models for the morphological classification of radio galaxies, which is particularly topical for the forthcoming large radio surveys. We demonstrate the use of generative models, specifically Wasserstein GANs (wGANs), to generate data for different classes of radio galaxies.</description>

The transients were discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) during 2018 - 2022. The HETDEX spectra are useful to classify a large number of objects found by photometric surveys for free. We attempt to explore and classify the spectra by utilizing machine learning (ML) and template matching techniques.</description>

We conducted one-dimensional stellar evolutionary numerical simulations to build blue supergiant stellar models with a very low-envelope mass and a super-Eddington luminosity of 10^7Lo that mimic the last phase of a common envelope evolution (CEE) where a neutron star (NS) accretes mass from the envelope and launches jets that power the system. Common envelope jets supernovae (CEJSNe) are CEE transient events where a NS spirals-in inside the envelope and then the core of a red supergiant (RSG) star accretes mass and launches jets that power the transient event.</description>

Hot ionized gas is important in the baryon cycle of galaxies and contributes the majority of their missing baryons&#39;&#39;. Until now, most semi-analytic models of galaxy formation have paid little attention to hot gaseous haloes and their X-ray emission. In this paper, we adopt the one-dimensional model from Sharma et al. instead of the isothermal sphere to describe the radial distribution of hot gas in the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model.</description>

Disk and halo orbits are separated by using the criteria defined in Carollo et al. (2021). We found 26 stars with $[Fe/H] \leq -2.5$ possessing disk kinematics, of which 14 are extremely metal-poor.</description>

ALMA observations have revealed that many high redshift galaxies are surrounded by extended (10-15 kpc) $[CII]$-emitting halos which are not predicted by even the most advanced zoom-in simulations. Using a semi-analytical model, in a previous work we suggested that such halos are produced by starburst-driven, catastrophically cooling outflows. Here, we further improve the model and compare its predictions with data from 7 star-forming ($10\lesssim \rm SFR/ M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}&amp;lt;100$) galaxies at z=4-6, observed in the ALPINE survey.</description>

Massively parallel multi-object spectrographs are on the leading edge of cosmology instrumentation. The highly successful Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) which begun survey operations in May 2021, for example, has 5,000 robotically-actuated multimode fibers, which deliver light from thousands of individual galaxies and quasars simultaneously to an array of high-resolution spectrographs off-telescope. The redshifts are individually measured, thus providing 3D maps of the Universe in unprecedented detail, and enabling precise measurement of dark energy expansion and other key cosmological parameters.</description>

These observations provide the fastest ever AGN multiband photometry and very precise lag measurements. Unlike in all other AGN, gs lags us by a large amount, consistent with disc reprocessing but not with reprocessing in the Broad Line Region (BLR).</description>

Joint analysis of CMB and large-scale structure at high redshifts provide new and unique windows into unexplored epochs of early structure formation. Here, we demonstrate how cosmic infrared background and high-redshift galaxies can be jointly analysed with CMB to probe the epoch of helium reionization ($2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4$) on the light cone using kinetic Sunyaev Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich tomography. Characterising this epoch has great potential significance for understanding astrophysics of galaxy formation, quasar activity and formation of the super-massive black holes.</description>

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are supermassive black holes with luminous accretion disks found in some galaxies, and are thought to play an important role in galaxy evolution. However, traditional optical spectroscopy for identifying AGN requires time-intensive observations. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish AGN host galaxies from non-active galaxies using a sample of 210,000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies. We evaluate the CNN on 33,000 galaxies that are spectrally classified as composites, and find correlations between galaxy appearances and their CNN classifications, which hint at evolutionary processes that affect both galaxy morphology and AGN activity.</description>

HCN, HNC, and their isotopologues are ubiquitous molecules that can serve as chemical thermometers and evolutionary tracers to characterize star-forming regions. Despite their importance in carrying information that is vital to studies of the chemistry and evolution of star-forming regions, the collision rates of some of these molecules have not been available for rigorous studies in the past. We perform an up-to-date gas and dust chemical characterization of two different star-forming regions, TMC 1-C and NGC 1333-C7, using new collisional rates of HCN, HNC, and their isotopologues.</description>

We use data from the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi gamma-ray space telescope (Fermi-LAT) to analyze the faint gamma-ray source located at the center of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. In the 4FGL-DR3 catalog, this source is associated with the globular cluster, M54, which is coincident with the dynamical center of this dwarf galaxy. We investigate the spectral energy distribution and spatial extension of this source, with the goal of testing two hypotheses: (1) the emission is due to millisecond pulsars within M54, or (2) the emission is due to annihilating dark matter from the Sgr halo.</description>

New optical photometric, spectrocopic and imaging polarimetry data are combined with publicly available data to study some of the physical properties of the two H-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSN) SN 2021bnw and SN 2021fpl. For each SLSN, the best-fit parameters obtained from the magnetar model with \texttt{MOSFiT} do not depart from the range of parameter obtained on other SLSNe discussed in the literature. A spectral analysis with \texttt{SYN++} shows that SN 2021bnw is a W Type, Fast evolver, while SN 2021fpl is a 15bn Type, Slow evolver.</description>

The Cosmological Principle, that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales, underpins the standard model of cosmology. However, a recent analysis of 1.36 million infrared-selected quasars has identified a significant tension in the amplitude of the number-count dipole compared to that derived from the CMB, thus challenging the Cosmological Principle. Here we present a Bayesian analysis of the same quasar sample, testing various hypotheses using the Bayesian evidence.</description>

Low-mass galaxies are highly susceptible to environmental effects that can efficiently quench star formation. We explore the role of ram pressure in quenching low-mass galaxies ($M_{}\sim10^{5-9},\rm{M}{\odot}$) within 2 Mpc of Milky Way (MW) hosts using the FIRE-2 simulations. Ram pressure is highly variable across different environments, within individual MW haloes, and for individual low-mass galaxies over time. The impulsiveness of ram pressure &amp;ndash; the maximum ram pressure scaled to the integrated ram pressure prior to quenching &amp;ndash; correlates with whether a galaxy is quiescent or star-forming.</description>

During the spectral transition, the brightness in the individual photometric bands increased up to $\approx$0.6 in the optical bands and up to $\approx$1.1 magnitudes in the UV bands. The brightening was accompanied by a blueward shift of the optical spectrum.</description>

Classification of galaxy morphology is a challenging but meaningful task for the enormous amount of data produced by the next-generation telescope. By introducing the adaptive polar coordinate transformation, we develop a rotationally invariant supervised machine learning (SML) method that ensures consistent classifications when rotating galaxy images, which is always required to be satisfied physically but difficult to achieve algorithmically. The adaptive polar coordinate transformation, compared with the conventional method of data augmentation by including additional rotated images in the training set, is proved to be an effective and efficient method in improving the robustness of the SML methods.</description>

Neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) are born when the final collapse of the stellar core terminates the lives of stars more massive than about 9 Msun. This can trigger the powerful ejection of a large fraction of the star&amp;rsquo;s material in a core-collapse supernova (CCSN), whose extreme luminosity is energized by the decay of radioactive isotopes such as 56Ni and 56Co. When evolving in close binary systems, the compact relics of such infernal catastrophes spiral towards each other on orbits gradually decaying by gravitational-wave emission.</description>

      <description>First author: Xiao-Dan Fu
Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) Galaxies are an important type of active galactic nucleus (AGN), generally expected to be accreting at high Eddington rate. The properties of their outflows and importance of AGN feedback remain intriguing. We report on the discovery of fast outflowing warm absorbers (WAs) in the NLS1 PG 1001+054, with velocities in the range of 7000 to 9000 kilometers per second. They are identified with blueshifted Lyman alpha, N v and Si iv lines in the high resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectra taken with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).</description>

It has long been speculated that Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies (BCDs) are formed through the interaction between low-mass gas-rich galaxies, but a few candidates of such systems have been studied in detail. We study a sample of compact star-forming dwarf galaxies that are selected from a merging dwarf galaxy catalog. We present a detailed study of their spectroscopic and structural properties. We find that these BCDs looking galaxies host extended stellar shells and thus are confirmed to be a dwarf-dwarf merger.</description>

We study the young star cluster populations in 23 dwarf and irregular galaxies observed by the HST Legacy ExtraGalactic Ultraviolet Survey (LEGUS), and examine relationships between the ensemble properties of the cluster populations and those of their host galaxies: star formation rate (SFR) density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). A strength of this analysis is the availability of SFRs measured from temporally resolved star formation histories which provide the means to match cluster and host-galaxy properties on several timescales (1-10, 1-100, and 10-100~Myr).</description>

Hydrodynamical interaction in circumbinary discs (CBDs) plays a crucial role in various astrophysical systems, ranging from young stellar binaries to supermassive black hole binaries in galactic centers. Most previous simulations of binary-disc systems have adopted locally isothermal equation of state. In this study, we use the grid-based code $\texttt{Athena++}$ to conduct a suite of two-dimensional viscous hydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary accretion on a cartesian grid, resolving the central cavity of the binary.</description>

We present an analysis of the instantaneous supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rates in a collection of 1563 post-merger galaxies drawn from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Our sample consists of galaxies that have experienced a merger in the last simulation snapshot (within ~160 Myrs of coalescence) in the redshift range 0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;1, with merger stellar mass ratios &amp;gt;1:10 and post-merger stellar masses &amp;gt; $10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We find that, on average, the accretion rates of the post-mergers are ~1.</description>

Using CANUCS imaging we found an apparent major merger of two $z\sim5$ ultra-low-mass galaxies ($M_\star\sim10^{7}M_\odot$ each) that are doubly imaged and magnified $\sim$12-15$\times$ by the lensing cluster MACS 0417. Both galaxies are experiencing young ($\sim$100 Myr), synchronised bursts of star formation with $\log({\rm sSFR/Gyr^{-1}} )\sim$1.3-1.4, yet SFRs of just $\sim 0.2 M_\odot\ {\rm yr}^{-1}$. They have sub-solar ($Z\sim0.2Z_\odot$) gas-phase metallicities and are connected by an even more metal-poor star-forming bridge.</description>

Galaxy clusters detected through the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect are a powerful cosmological probe from which constraints on cosmological parameters such as $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\sigma_8$ can be derived. The measured cluster tSZ signal can be, however, contaminated by Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) emission, as the CIB is spatially correlated with the cluster tSZ field. We quantify the extent of this contamination by applying the iterative multi-frequency matched filter (iMMF) cluster-finding method to mock Planck-like data from the Websky simulation.</description>

The idea of ultralight scalar (axion) dark matter is theoretically appealing and may resolve some small-scale problems of cold dark matter; so it deserves careful attention. In this work we carefully analyze tunneling of the scalar field in dwarf satellites due to the tidal gravitational force from the host halo. The tidal force is far from spherically symmetric; causing tunneling along the axis from the halo center to the dwarf, while confining in the orthogonal plane.</description>

We conduct hydrodynamical MOND simulations of isolated disc galaxies over the stellar mass range $M_{\star}/M_\odot = 10^7 - 10^{11}$ using the adaptive mesh refinement code \textsc{phantom of ramses} (\textsc{por}), an adaptation of the \textsc{ramses} code with a Milgromian gravity solver. The scale lengths and gas fractions are based on observed galaxies, and the simulations are run for 5~Gyr. The main aim is to see whether existing sub-grid physics prescriptions for star formation and stellar feedback reproduce the observed main sequence and reasonably match the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation that captures how the local and global star formation rates relate to other properties.</description>

      <description>First author: Francois Hammer
Halo inhabitants are individual stars, stellar streams, star and globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies. Here we compare the two last categories that include objects of similar stellar mass, which are often studied as self-dynamical equilibrium systems. We discover that the half-light radius of globular clusters depends on their orbital pericenter and total energy, and that Milky Way (MW) tides may explain the observed correlation. We also suggest that the accretion epoch of stellar systems in the MW halo can be calibrated by the total orbital energy, and that such a relation is due to both the mass growth of the MW and dynamical friction affecting mostly satellites with numerous orbits.</description>

IRAS23226-3843 has previously been classified as a changing-look AGN based on X-ray and optical spectral variations. In 2019, Swift observations revealed a strong rebrightening in X-ray and UV fluxes in comparison to observations in 2017. We took follow-up Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR observations together with optical spectra (SALT and SAAO 1.9m telescope) from 2019 until 2021. IRAS23226-3843 showed a strong X-ray and optical outburst in 2019.</description>

We investigate the main tensions within the current standard model of cosmology from the perspective of the void size function in BOSS DR12 data. For this purpose, we present the first cosmological constraints on the parameters $S_8\equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ and $H_0$ obtained from voids as a stand-alone probe. We rely on an extension of the popular volume-conserving model for the void size function, tailored to the application on data, including geometric and dynamic distortions.</description>

To ensure robust estimates of the lensing magnification $\mu$, we use an improved version of our model that exploits the first epoch of NIRCam images and newly obtained MUSE spectra, and avoids regions with $\mu&amp;gt;5$ where the uncertainty may be higher.</description>

The assembly of stellar and supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in elliptical galaxies since $z\sim1$ can help to diagnose the origins of locally-observed correlations between SMBH mass and stellar mass. We therefore construct three samples of elliptical galaxies, one at $z\sim0$ and two at $0.7\lesssim z \lesssim2.5$, and quantify their relative positions in the $M_{BH}-M_*$ plane. Using a Bayesian analysis framework, we find evidence for translational offsets in both stellar mass and SMBH mass between the local sample and both higher redshift samples.</description>

Degeneracies among parameters of the cosmological model are known to drastically limit the information contained in the matter distribution. In the first paper of this series, we shown that the cosmic web environments; namely the voids, walls, filaments and nodes; can be used as a leverage to improve the real-space constraints on a set of six cosmological parameters, including the summed neutrino mass. Following-upon these results, we propose to study the achievable constraints of environment-dependent power spectra in redshift space where the velocities add up information to the standard two-point statistics by breaking the isotropy of the matter density field.</description>

We probe the connection between galaxy structure and broad stellar population properties, at stellar masses log(M/Msun)&amp;gt;10.85. We find that quiescent and star-forming cluster galaxy populations are largely dominated by bulge- and disk-dominated sources, respectively, with relative contributions consistent with those of field counterparts.</description>

We present a new definition of cosmic void and a publicly available code with the algorithm that implements it. In this void finder, underdense regions are defined as free-form objects, called popcorn voids, made from the union of spheres of maximum volume with a given joint integrated underdensity contrast. This provides, for the first time, a definition of a void in the matter field whose abundance can be faithfully reproduced by excursion set theory, in particular using the Vdn model without any adjustment or cleaning process.</description>

We estimate a gas column density of $ \approx (1.3 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{20},T_{\rm{spin}}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$ with spin temperature, $T_{\rm{spin}} \leq 194$ K, consistent with the HI properties of other early-type galaxies and cool-core cluster BCGs.</description>

Recent observations show that the metallicity of the broad line region ($Z_{\rm BLR}$) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is solar-to-supersolar, which is positively correlated with the mass of supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm BH}$) and does not evolve with redshift up to $z \sim 7$. We revisit the $M_{\rm BH}-Z_{\rm BLR}$ correlation with more AGNs with $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^{6-8} M_{\odot}$ and find that the positive correlation become flat in low-mass range.</description>

Satellite galaxies of the Milky Way with high mass-to-light ratios and little baryon content, i.e. dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), are among the most promising targets to detect or constrain the nature of dark matter (DM) through its final annihilation products into high-energy photons. Previously, the assumption that DM emission from dSphs is point-like has been used to set strong constraints on DM candidates using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT).</description>

      <description>First author: Seiji Fujimoto
We present ALMA deep spectroscopy for a lensed galaxy at $z_{\rm spec}=8.496$ with $\log(M_{\rm star}/M_{\odot})\sim7.8$ whose optical nebular lines and stellar continuum are detected by JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam Early Release Observations in SMACS0723. Our ALMA spectrum shows $[OIII]$ 88$\mu$m and $[CII]$158$\mu$m line detections at $4.0\sigma$ and $4.5\sigma$, respectively. The redshift and position of the $[OIII]$ line coincide with those of the JWST source, while the $[CII]$ line is blue-shifted by 90 km s$^{-1}$ with a spatial offset of $0.</description>

      <description>First author: Bonny Y. Wang
Cosmic voids are the largest and most underdense structures in the Universe. Their properties have been shown to encode precious information about the laws and constituents of the Universe. We show that machine learning techniques can unlock the information in void features for cosmological parameter inference. We rely on thousands of void catalogs from the GIGANTES dataset, where every catalog contains an average of 11,000 voids from a volume of $1~(h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$.</description>

      <description>First author: Jacob Marshall
We calculate the properties of 135 stellar supernovae using data from the Open Supernova Catalog. We generate temperatures, radii, luminosities, and expansion velocities using a spherically symmetric optically thick fireball model. These modeled parameters reveal trends that are common across different types of supernovae. We have identified distinct phases that appear across Type Ia, II, II P, and IIb supernovae. We note that there is a long period of reasonable continuous growth (Phase 1), giving credence to our simple model of an optically thick fireball.</description>

      <description>First author: Sharon E. Meidt
JWST/MIRI imaging of the nearby galaxies IC 5332, NGC 628, NGC 1365 and NGC 7496 from PHANGS reveals a richness of gas structures that in each case form a quasi-regular network of interconnected filaments, shells and voids. We examine whether this multi-scale network of structure is consistent with the fragmentation of the gas disk through gravitational instability. We use FilFinder to detect the web of filamentary features in each galaxy and determine their characteristic radial and azimuthal spacings.</description>

The era of Gravitational-Wave (GW) astronomy will grant the detection of the astrophysical GW background from unresolved mergers of binary black holes, and the prospect of probing the presence of primordial GW backgrounds. In particular, the low-frequency tail of the GW spectrum for causally-generated primordial signals (like a phase transition) offers an excellent opportunity to measure unambiguously cosmological parameters as the equation of state of the universe, or free-streaming particles at epochs well before recombination.</description>

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are standardizable candles that must be modeled empirically to yield cosmological constraints. To understand the robustness of this modeling to variations in the model training procedure, we build an end-to-end pipeline to test the recently developed SALT3 model. We explore the consequences of removing pre-2000s low-$z$ or poorly calibrated $U$-band data, adjusting the amount and fidelity of SN Ia spectra, and using a model-independent framework to simulate the training data.</description>

      <description>First author: Xiaohui Fan
Quasars at cosmic dawn provide powerful probes of the formation and growth of the earliest supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the universe, their connections to galaxy and structure formation, and the evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). Hundreds of quasars have been discovered in the first billion years of cosmic history, with the quasar redshift frontier extended to z~7.6. Observations of quasars at cosmic dawn show that: (1) The number density of luminous quasars declines exponentially at z&amp;gt;5, suggesting that the earliest quasars emerge at z~10; the lack of strong evolution in their average spectral energy distribution indicates a rapid buildup of the AGN environment.</description>

We present a joint analysis of the galaxy S04590 at $z=8.496$ based on NIRSpec, NIRCam, and NIRISS observations obtained through as part of Early Release Observations programme of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the far-infrared $[CII]$-$158\mu$m emission line detected by dedicated Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We determine the physical properties of S04590 from modelling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) and through the redshifted optical nebular emission lines detected with JWST/NIRSpec.</description>

After decades, the theoretical study of core-collapse supernova explosions is moving from parameterized, spherically symmetric models to increasingly realistic multi-dimensional simulations. Obtaining nucleosynthesis yields based on such multi-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations, however, is not straightforward and frequently tracer particles are employed. Tracer particles may be tracked in situ during the simulation, but often they are reconstructed in a post-processing step based on the information saved during the hydrodynamics simulation.</description>

We present a sample-variance-limited measurement of the temperature power spectrum ($TT$) of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) using observations of a $\sim! 1500 ,\mathrm{deg}^2$ field made by SPT-3G in 2018. We report multifrequency power spectrum measurements at 95, 150, and 220GHz covering the angular multipole range $750 \leq \ell &amp;lt; 3000$. We combine this $TT$ measurement with the published polarization power spectrum measurements from the 2018 observing season and update their associated covariance matrix to complete the SPT-3G 2018 $TT/TE/EE$ data set.</description>

Hubble Space Telescope imaging for 26 giant early-type galaxies, all drawn from the MAST archive, is used to carry out photometry of their surrounding globular cluster (GC) systems. Most of these targets are Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) and their distances range from 24 to 210 Mpc. The catalogs of photometry, completed with DOLPHOT, are publicly available. The GC color indices are converted to $[Fe/H]$ through a combination of 12-Gyr SSP (Single Stellar Population) models and direct spectroscopic calibration of the fiducial color index (F475W-F850LP).</description>

Gas accretion of embedded stellar-mass black holes,(sBHs) or stars in the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei,(AGNs) will modify the mass distribution of these sBHs and stars, which will also affect the migration of the sBHs/stars. \textbf{With the introduction of the mass accretion effect, we simulate the evolution of the sBH/star distribution function in a consistent way by extending the Fokker-Planck equation of sBH/star distributions to the mass-varying scenario, and explore the mass distribution of sBHs in the nuclear region of the galaxy centre.</description>

We investigate the accuracy and precision of triaxial dynamical orbit models by fitting two dimensional mock observations of a realistic N-body merger simulation resembling a massive early-type galaxy with a supermassive black hole (SMBH). We show that we can reproduce the triaxial N-body merger remnant&amp;rsquo;s correct black hole mass, stellar mass-to-light ratio and total enclosed mass (inside the half-light radius) for several different tested orientations with an unprecedented accuracy of 5-10%.</description>

Cool outflows are now commonly observed in galaxies, but their physical origin and driving mechanism remain unclear. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback can potentially accelerate cool galactic outflows via cosmic rays (CR) and radiation pressure on dust. Here we investigate the relative importance of CR and radiation feedback in AGNs, and we analyse the physical conditions for outflow launching as a function of the black hole accretion flow mode.</description>

Motivated by the increasing number of gravitational wave detections of merging black holes (BHs) by LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA, BH binary mergers in the discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is investigated as a possible merger channel. In this pathway, BHs in the large gas disc are expected to encounter one another, become mutually bound as a BH binary system through interaction with the gas in the disc and subsequently inspiral through gravitational torques induced by the local gas until merger.</description>

Sophisticated spectral energy distribution (SED) models describe dust attenuation and emission using geometry parameters. This treatment is natural since dust effects are driven by the underlying star-dust geometry in galaxies. An example is the Starduster SED model, which divides a galaxy into a stellar disk, a stellar bulge, and a dust disk. This work utilises the Starduster SED model to study the efficacy of inferring geometry parameters using spatially integrated SED fitting.</description>

Bouncing models of cosmology, as they arise e.g. in loop quantum cosmology, can generate close-to-scale-invariant fluctuation spectra as observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, they are typically not Gaussian and also generate a bispectrum. It was proposed that these models can help to mitigate the large-scale anomalies of the CMB by considering large non-Gaussianities on very large scales, which decay exponentially on sub-horizon scales.</description>

The study of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) is vital in order to understand their respective nuclei bounded activity primarily triggered by the accretion disk and the associated corona. The hard X-ray emission characterised by the spectral index $\Gamma$ emitted by these sources in 2-10 keV band ionizes the nearby physical features like disk, BLR, NLR and provides a radiative configuration. However, based on previous studies, there is degeneracy in the evolution of $\Gamma$ across the redshift, wherein few studies display a systematic trend in the evolution and others rule out the systematic variation.</description>

We have developed a pipeline called \mentari to generate the far-ultraviolet to far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies from the \dustysage semi-analytic galaxy formation model (SAM). \dustysage incorporates dust-related processes directly on top of the basic ingredients of galaxy formation like gas infall, cooling, star formation, feedback, and mergers. We derive a physically motivated attenuation model from the computed dust properties in \dustysage, so each galaxy has a self-consistent set of attenuation parameters based on the complicated dust physics that occurred across the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s assembly history.</description>

Data Release 3 includes 47.4 million sources (29.8 million with $r \le 21$) on 3192 deg$^2$ (2881 deg$^2$ after masking). J-PLUS DR3 only provides star-galaxy classification so that quasars are not identified from the other sources. Given the size of the dataset, machine learning methods could provide a valid alternative classification and a solution to the classification of quasars.</description>

Voids occupy about 3/4 of the volume of the Universe and contain about 15% of its mass. Due to various observational selection effects, these structure elements and galaxies populating voids, are highly under-explored. This especially relates to the lowest mass galaxies which comprise the main void population. Studying the nearby voids allows us to improve our understanding of the most elusive void objects. We present the brief overview of the current status and the prospects of the study of the nearest voids and their galaxies.</description>

Action-based dynamical modelling, using stars as dynamical tracers, is an excellent diagnostic to estimate the underlying axisymmetric matter distribution of the Milky Way. However, the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s bar causes non-axisymmetric resonance features in the stellar disc. Using Roadmapping (an action-based dynamical modelling framework to estimate the gravitational potential and the stellar distribution function), we systematically quantify the robustness of action-based modelling in the presence of a bar.</description>

      <description>First author: Maxime Trebitsch
The fraction of ionizing photons escaping from galaxies, $f_{esc}$, is at the same time a crucial parameter in modelling reionization and a very poorly known quantity, especially at high redshift. Recent observations are starting to constrain the values of $f_{esc}$ in low-z star-forming galaxies, but the validity of this comparison remains to be verified. Applying at high-z the empirical relation between $f_{esc}$ and the UV slope trends derived from the Low-z Lyman Continuum Survey, we use the DELPHI semi-analytical galaxy formation model to estimate the global ionizing emissivity of high-z galaxies, which we use to compute the resulting reionization history.</description>

We present a study of nearby dwarf galaxies selected from the ALFALFA blind HI survey. A primary goal of the project was to utilize a non-standard selection method with the hope of detecting previously unrecognized extremely metal-poor (XMP) galaxies. The study was motivated by the recent discovery of two XMP galaxies $-$ Leo P and Leoncino $-$ which were both originally found via the ALFALFA survey.</description>

We present ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) observations and analysis of the nearby Type Ia supernova SN 2021fxy. Our observations include UV photometry from Swift/UVOT, UV spectroscopy from HST/STIS, and high-cadence optical photometry with the Swope 1-m telescope capturing intra-night rises during the early light curve. Early $B-V$ colours show SN 2021fxy is the first &amp;ldquo;shallow-silicon&amp;rdquo; (SS) SN Ia to follow a red-to-blue evolution, compared to other SS objects which show blue colours from the earliest observations.</description>

We study the environmental effect of galaxy evolution as a function of the underlying 3D dark matter density for the first time at $z=2-2.5$, in which the underlying matter density is reconstructed from galaxy and Ly$\alpha$ forest spectroscopy through dynamical forward modeling techniques. Utilizing these maps, we investigate the dependence of the star formation activities and galaxy types (mergers, submillimeter galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and quiescent galaxies) on the matter overdensity $\Delta$ and stellar mass.</description>

Using multi-wavelength (MWL) information (optical, X-rays, mid-IR), we characterized the intrinsic nuclear properties of this sample and compared them with those of isolated systems. Among the 124 X-ray detected AGN candidates, 52 appear in pairs and 72 as single X-ray sources. Through MWL analysis, we confirmed the presence of the AGN in a fraction &amp;gt;80% of the detected targets in pairs (42 over 52).</description>

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which has recently become operational, is capable of detecting objects at record-breaking redshifts, $z \gtrsim 15$. This is a crucial advance for observational cosmology, as at these redshifts the differences between alternative cosmological models manifest themselves in the most obvious way. In recent years, some observational hints have emerged indicating that the Standard Cosmological Model could require correcting. One of these hints is related to the discovery of remote galaxies whose redshifts correspond to the very young Universe (less than one billion years after the Big Bang) but which are similar to nearby galaxies.</description>

The future astronomical imaging surveys are set to provide precise constraints on cosmological parameters, such as dark energy. However, production of synthetic data for these surveys, to test and validate analysis methods, suffers from a very high computational cost. In particular, generating mock galaxy catalogs at sufficiently large volume and high resolution will soon become computationally unreachable. In this paper, we address this problem with a Deep Generative Model to create robust mock galaxy catalogs that may be used to test and develop the analysis pipelines of future weak lensing surveys.</description>

Upcoming cosmological weak lensing surveys are expected to constrain cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision. In preparation for these surveys, large simulations with realistic galaxy populations are required to test and validate analysis pipelines. However, these simulations are computationally very costly &amp;ndash; and at the volumes and resolutions demanded by upcoming cosmological surveys, they are computationally infeasible. Here, we propose a Deep Generative Modeling approach to address the specific problem of emulating realistic 3D galaxy orientations in synthetic catalogs.</description>

Supersonic interacting flows occurring in phenomena such as protostellar jets give rise to strong shocks, and have been demonstrated in several laboratory experiments. To study such colliding flows, we use the AstroBEAR AMR code to conduct hydrodynamic simulations in three dimensions. We introduce variations in the flow parameters of density, velocity, and cross sectional radius of the colliding flows %radius in order to study the propagation and conical shape of the bow shock formed by collisions between two, not necessarily symmetric, hypersonic flows.</description>

The splashback radius of a dark matter halo, which corresponds to the first apocenter radius reached by infalling matter and substructures, has been detected around galaxy clusters using a multitude of observational methods, including weak lensing measurements. In this manuscript, we present how the splashback feature in the halo density profile affects galaxy cluster masses derived through weak lensing measurements if it is not accounted for.</description>

Context. The globular cluster (GC) system of Circinus galaxy has not been probed previously partly because of the location of the galaxy at - 3.8$^\circ$ Galactic latitude which suffers severely from interstellar extinction, stellar crowding, and Galactic foreground contamination. However, the deep near-infrared (NIR) photometry by the VISTA Variables in the Via L&#39;actea Extended Survey (VVVX) in combination with the precise astrometry of Gaia EDR3 allow us to map GCs in this region.</description>

We report on the identification of a new $\gamma$-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy ($\gamma$-NLS1), SDSS J095909.51+460014.3 (hereinafter J0959+4600, $z$ = 0.399), by establishing its association with a $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL 0959.6+4606, although its low-energy counterpart was suggested to be a radio galaxy 2MASX J09591976+4603515 (hereinafter J0959+4603). \emph{WISE} long-term light curves of these two sources reveal diverse infrared variability patterns. Violent infrared variations of J0959+4600 with an amplitude up to one order of magnitude has been detected, while variability is mild for the other one.</description>

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions in the universe. The standard model invokes a relativistic fireball with a bright photosphere emission component. How efficiently the jet converts its energy to radiation is a long-standing problem and it is poorly constrained. A definitive diagnosis of GRB radiation components and measurement of GRB radiative efficiency requires prompt emission and afterglow data with high-resolution and wide-band coverage in time and energy.</description>

Galaxies throughout the last 12 Gyr of cosmic time follow a single, universal fundamental plane that relates their star-formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses ($M_\star$) and chemical abundances. Deviation from these fundamental scaling relations would imply a drastic change in the processes that regulate galaxy evolution. Observations have hinted at the possibility that this relation may be broken in the very early universe. However, until recently, chemical abundances of galaxies could be only measured reliably as far back as redshift $z = 3.</description>

Cosmological weak lensing measurements rely on a precise measurement of the shear two-point correlation function (2PCF) along with a deep understanding of systematics that affect it. In this work, we demonstrate a general framework for describing the impact of PSF systematics on the cosmic shear 2PCF, and mitigating its impact on cosmological analysis. Our framework can describe leakage and modeling error from all spin-2 quantities contributed by the PSF second and higher moments, rather than just the second moments.</description>

The discrepancy between the mass of galaxies and their rotational velocity is one of the most puzzling scientific phenomena. Despite over a century of research, this phenomenon is not fully understood. Common explanations include dark matter and MOND, among other theories. Here we report on another observation that shows tension between the physics of galaxy rotation and its rotational velocity. We compare the brightness of galaxies, and find that galaxies that spin in the same direction as the Milky Way have different brightness than galaxies that spin in the opposite direction.</description>

Third-order weak lensing statistics are a promising tool for cosmological analyses since they extract cosmological information in the non-Gaussianity of the cosmic large-scale structure. However, such analyses require precise and accurate models for the covariance. In this second paper of a series on third-order weak lensing statistics, we derive and validate an analytic model for the covariance of the third-order aperture statistics $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^3\rangle$. We derive the covariance model from a real-space estimator for $\langle M_\mathrm{ap}^3\rangle$.</description>

For our analysis, we used a sample of 54 non-cool core clusters from the HIFLUGCS sample. We do not find any evidence for a linear trend in the aforementioned ratio as a function of radius for individual clusters.</description>

We study the Fourier time-lags due to the Comptonization of disc-emitted photons in a spherical, uniform, and stationary X-ray corona, which located on the rotational axis of the black hole. We use Monk, a general relativistic Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, to calculate Compton scattering of photons emitted by a thin disc with a Novikov-Thorne temperature profile. We find that the model time-lags due to Comptonization remain constant up to a characteristic frequency and then rapidly decrease to zero at higher frequencies.</description>

Despite the importance of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) in models of galaxy evolution, observational constraints on the influence of AGN feedback on star formation remain weak. To this end, we have compared the star formation trends of 279 low-redshift AGN galaxies with 558 non-active control galaxies using integral field unit spectroscopy from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. With a Gaussian process-based methodology, we reconstruct non-parametric star formation histories in spatially-resolved spaxels covering the face of each galaxy.</description>

We explore a possible scenario of the explosion as a result of core collapses of rotating massive stars that leave a black hole by performing a radiation-viscous-hydrodynamics simulation in numerical relativity. We take moderately and rapidly rotating compact pre-collapse stellar models derived in stellar evolution calculations as the initial conditions. We find that the viscous heating in the disk formed around the central black hole powers an outflow.</description>

      <description>First author: A. Gkogkou
In the submm regime, spectral line scans and line intensity mapping (LIM) are new promising probes for the cold gas content and star formation rate of galaxies across cosmic time. However, both of these two measurements suffer from field-to-field variance. We study the effect of field-to-field variance on the predicted CO and CII power spectra from future LIM experiments such as CONCERTO, as well as on the line luminosity functions (LFs) and the cosmic molecular gas mass density that are currently derived from spectral line scans.</description>

      <description>First author: Sidney Lower
We present the Cosmic Sands suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations based on the Simba galaxy formation model in order to study the build up of the first massive and dusty galaxies in the early Universe. Residing in the most massive halos, we find that the compact proto-massive galaxies undergo nearly continuous mergers with smaller subhalos, boosting star formation rates (SFRs) and the build up of stellar mass.</description>

      <description>First author: Sofia Contarini
We present the first cosmological constraints derived from the analysis of the void size function. This work relies on the final BOSS DR12 data set, a large spectroscopic galaxy catalog, ideal for the identification of cosmic voids. We extract a sample of voids from the distribution of galaxies and we apply a cleaning procedure aimed at reaching high levels of purity and completeness. We model the void size function by means of an extension of the popular volume-conserving model, based on two additional nuisance parameters.</description>

      <description>First author: J. R. Weaver
How galaxies form, assemble, and cease their star-formation is a central question within the modern landscape of galaxy evolution studies. These processes are indelibly imprinted on the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF). We present constraints on the shape and evolution of the SMF, the quiescent galaxy fraction, and the cosmic stellar mass density across 90% of the history of the Universe from $z=7.5\rightarrow0.2$ via the COSMOS survey.</description>

Surveys with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have discovered candidate galaxies in the first 400 Myr of cosmic time. The properties of these distant galaxies provide initial conditions for understanding early galaxy formation and cosmic reionisation. Preliminary indications have suggested these candidate galaxies may be more massive and abundant than previously thought. However, without spectroscopic confirmation of their distances to constrain their intrinsic brightnesses, their inferred properties remain uncertain.</description>

We study the optical variability of a sample of candidate low-mass (dwarf ang Seyfert) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using Zwicky Transient Facility g-band light curves. Our sample is compiled from broad-line AGNs in dwarf galaxies reported in the literature with single-epoch virial black hole (BH) masses in the range $M_{\rm{BH}} \sim 10^{4}$&amp;ndash;$10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$. We measure the characteristic ``damping&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; timescale of the optical variability $\tau_{\rm{DRW}}$, beyond which the power spectral density flattens, of a final sample of 79 candidate low-mass AGNs with high-quality light curves.</description>

      <description>First author: Michaela Hirschmann
We compute synthetic, rest-frame optical and ultraviolet (UV) emission-line properties of galaxy populations at redshifts from z$\approx$0 to z=8 in a full cosmological framework. We achieve this by coupling, in post-processing, the cosmological IllustrisTNG simulations with new-generation nebular-emission models, accounting for line emission from young stars, post-asymptotic-giant-branch (PAGB) stars, accreting black holes (BHs) and, for the first time, fast radiative shocks. The optical emission-line properties of simulated galaxies dominated by different ionizing sources are largely consistent with those expected from classical diagnostic diagrams and reflect the observed increase in OIII/H$\beta$ at fixed NII/H$\alpha$ and the evolution of the H$\alpha$, OIII$\lambda5007$ and OII$\lambda3727$ luminosity functions from z$\approx$0 to z$\sim$2.</description>

      <description>Andrew Cheek
Many cosmological phenomena lead to the production of primordial black holes in the early Universe. These phenomena often create a population of black holes with extended mass and spin distributions. As these black holes evaporate via Hawking radiation, they can modify various cosmological observables, lead to the production of dark matter, modify the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom, $N_{\rm eff}$, source a stochastic gravitational wave background and alter the dynamics of baryogenesis.</description>

Using mock data for SNIa, QSOs and GRBs generated based on the power-law $f(T)$ model, we show whether different cosmographic methods are suitable to reconstruct the distance modulus or not.</description>

In this paper, we study how gaseous dynamical friction (DF) affects the motion of fly-by stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs. We perform 3-body integrations of the interaction of two co-planar sBHs in nearby, initially circular orbits around the supermassive black hole (SMBH). We find that DF can facilitate the formation of gravitationally bound near-Keplerian binaries in AGN discs, and we delineate the discrete ranges of impact parameters and AGN disc parameters for which such captures occur.</description>

We present radial gas-phase metallicity profiles, gradients, and break radii at redshift $z = 0 - 3$ from the TNG50-1 star-forming galaxy population. These metallicity profiles are characterized by an emphasis on identifying the steep inner gradient and flat outer gradient. From this, the break radius, $r_{\rm Break}$, is defined as the region where the transition occurs. We observe the break radius having a positive trend with mass that weakens with redshift.</description>

Recent attempts to detect OIII 88$\mu$m emission from super-early ($z&amp;gt;10$) galaxy candidates observed by JWST have been unsuccessful. By using zoom-in simulations, we show that these galaxies are faint, and mostly fall below the local metal-poor $[OIII]-SFR$ relation as a result of their low ionization parameter, $U_{\rm ion}\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Such low $U_{\rm ion}$ values are found in galaxies that are in an early assembly stage, and whose stars are still embedded in high-density natal clouds.</description>

We detect six ridge structures, including five ridges apparent in the radial velocity distribution and three ridges apparent in the vertical velocity, the sensitive time of which to the perturbations are from young population (0$-$3 Gyr) to old population (9$-$14 Gyr).</description>

Fluctuations play a critical role in cosmology. They are relevant across a range of phenomena from the dynamics of inflation to the formation of structure. In many cases, these fluctuations are coarse grained and follow a Gaussian distribution as a consequence of the Central Limit Theorem. Yet, some classes of observables are dominated by rare fluctuations and are sensitive to the details of the underlying microphysics. In this paper, we argue that the Large Deviation Principle can be used to diagnose when one must to appeal to the fundamental description.</description>

We develop a novel approach to measure dust attenuation properties of galaxies,including the dust opacity and shape of the attenuation curve in both optical and NUV, as well as the strength of the 2175{\AA} absorption feature. From an observed spectrum the method uses a model-independent approach to derive a relative attenuation curve.The absolute amplitude is then calibrated with the NIR photometry. The dust-corrected spectrum is fitted with stellar population models to derive the dust-free model spectrum covering the whole wavelength range from NUV to NIR and is compared with the observed SED/spectrum to determine dust attenuation properties.</description>

Hadronic $\gamma$-ray sources associated with supernova remnants (SNRs) can serve as stopwatches for the escape of cosmic rays from SNRs, which gradually develops from highest-energy particles to lowest-energy particles with time. In this work, we analyze the 13.7~yr \emph{Fermi}-LAT data to investigate the $\gamma$-ray feature in/around the SNR G298.6$-$0.0 region. With $\gamma$-ray spatial analyses, we detect three point-like components. Among them, Src-NE is at the eastern SNR shell, and Src-NW is adjacent to the western edge of this SNR.</description>

Recent cosmological analyses with large-scale structure and weak lensing measurements, usually referred to as 3$\times$2pt, had to discard a lot of signal-to-noise from small scales due to our inability to precisely model non-linearities and baryonic effects. Galaxy-galaxy lensing, or the position-shear correlation between lens and source galaxies, is one of the three two-point correlation functions that are included in such analyses, usually estimated with the mean tangential shear.</description>

We reproduce the rotation curve of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) by taking into account its bulge, disk, and halo components, considering the last one to contain the major part of dark matter mass. Hence, our prescription is to split the galactic bulge into two components, namely, the inner and main bulges, respectively. Both bulges are thus modeled by exponential density profiles since we underline that the widely accepted de Vaucouleurs law fails to reproduce the whole galactic bulge rotation curve.</description>

The morphological classification of galaxies is considered a relevant issue and can be approached from different points of view. The increasing growth in the size and accuracy of astronomical data sets brings with it the need for the use of automatic methods to perform these classifications. The aim of this work is to propose and evaluate a method for automatic unsupervised classification of kinematic morphologies of galaxies that yields a meaningful clustering and captures the variations of the fundamental properties of galaxies.</description>

      <description>First author: M. Sharma
We derive the Ultra-Violet (UV) luminosity function (LF) of star forming galaxies falling in the redshift range $z = 0.6 - 1.2$, in the rest-frame far-UV (1500 {\AA}) wavelength. For this work we are in particular interested in the bright end of the UV LF in this redshift range. The data from \textit{XMM-Newton} Optical Monitor (XMM-OM), near-ultraviolet (1600-4000 {\AA}) observations over 1.5 deg\textsuperscript{2} of the COSMOS field are employed for this purpose.</description>

We present a photometric halo mass estimation technique for local galaxies that enables us to establish the stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation down to stellar masses of 10$^5$ M$\odot$. We find no detectable differences among the SMHM relations of four local galaxy clusters or between the cluster and field relations and we find agreement with extrapolations of previous SMHM relations derived using abundance matching approaches. We fit a power law to our empirical SMHM relation and find that for adopted NFW dark matter profiles and for M$* &amp;lt; 10^9$ M$\odot$, the halo mass is M$h = 10^{10.</description>

The detected polarized radio emission from remnant of SN1987A opens the possibility to unveil the structure of the pre-supernova magnetic field in the circumstellar medium. Properties derived from direct measurements would be of importance for understanding the progenitor stars and their magnetic fields. As the first step to this goal, we adopted the hydrodynamic data from an elaborated three-dimensional (3-D) numerical model of SN1987A. We have developed an approximate method for reconstruction&#39; of 3-D magnetic field structure inside supernova remnant on the hydrodynamic background&amp;rsquo;.</description>

We use the comoving volume densities of the AGN samples to quantify the effects that tidal interactions have on the triggering of nuclear accretion.</description>

      <description>Shubham Raghuvanshi
It has been argued that the low-mass primordial stars ($m_{\rm Pop III}\,\leq 0.8\,M_\odot$) are likely to enter the main sequence and hence possibly be found in the present-day Galaxy. However, due to limitations in existing numerical capabilities, current three-dimensional (3D) &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;search-hit mathjax&amp;quot;&amp;gt;simulations&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; of disk fragmentation are capable of following only a few thousands of years of evolution after the formation of the first protostar. In this work we use a modified version of {\sc Gadget}-2 smoothed particle hydrodynamics(SPH) code to present the results of non-linear collapse of the gas clouds associated with various degrees of initial solid body rotation (parameterized by $β$) using a piecewise polytropic equation of state.</description>

In recent years, radio interferometric observations have achieved high accuracy in determining the absolute values of trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of maser radiation sources and radio stars. The error in determining the trigonometric parallaxes of these objects averages about 10 microarcseconds, which allows us to confidently study the geometric and kinematic properties of the distribution of stars located at great distances from the Sun, up to the center of the Galaxy.</description>

      <description>First author: Ji-Yu Song
Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences encode the absolute luminosity distances of GW sources. Once the redshifts of GW sources are known, one can use the distance-redshift relation to constrain cosmological parameters. One way to obtain the redshifts is to localize GW sources by GW observations and then use galaxy catalogs to determine redshifts from a statistical analysis of redshift information of the potential host galaxies, and such GW data are commonly referred to as dark sirens.</description>

The study of galaxy evolution hinges on our ability to interpret multi-wavelength galaxy observations in terms of their physical properties. To do this, we rely on spectral energy distribution (SED) models which allow us to infer physical parameters from spectrophotometric data. In recent years, thanks to the wide and deep multi-waveband galaxy surveys, the volume of high quality data have significantly increased. Alongside the increased data, algorithms performing SED fitting have improved, including better modeling prescriptions, newer templates, and more extensive sampling in wavelength space.</description>

We investigate the formation channels of the intracluster light (ICL) and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in clusters at $z=0$. For this, we perform multi-resolution cosmological N-body simulations using the &amp;ldquo;Galaxy Replacement Technique&amp;rdquo; (GRT). We study the formation channels of the ICL and BCG as a function of distance from the cluster center and the dynamical state of the clusters at $z=0$. To do this, we trace back the stars of the ICL and BCG, and identify the stellar components in which they existed when they first fell into the clusters.</description>

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transients with large dispersion measures. The origin of FRBs is still mysterious. One of the methods to comprehend FRB origin is to probe the physical environments of FRB host galaxies. Mapping molecular-gas kinematics in FRB host galaxies is critical because it results in star formation that is likely connected to the birth of FRB progenitors. However, most previous works of FRB host galaxies have focused on its stellar component.</description>

Spectroscopic detection of transient narrow emission lines (flash-ionisation features) traces the presence of circumstellar material (CSM) around massive stars exploding as core-collapse supernovae. Transient emission lines disappearing shortly after the SN explosion suggest that the spatial extent of this material is compact; hence implying that the progenitor star experienced episodes of enhanced mass loss shortly prior to explosion. The early light curves of Type II supernovae (SNe II) are assumed to be initially powered by shock-cooling emission.</description>

We adopt a resolved stellar feedback model with non-equilibrium cooling and heating, including photoelectric heating and photo-ionizing radiation, as well as supernovae (SNe), coupled to the second order meshless finite mass (MFM) method for hydrodynamics.</description>

SN 2019kbj shows roughly constant temperature during the first month after peak, indicating a power source (likely CSM interaction) that keeps the continuum emission hot at ~15000K.</description>

Early galaxies were the radiation source for reionization, with the photoheating feedback from the reionization process expected to reduce the efficiency of star formation in low mass haloes. Hence, to fully understand reionization and galaxy formation, we must study their impact on each other. The THESAN project has so far aimed to study the impact of galaxy formation physics on reionization, but here we present the new THESAN simulations with a factor 50 higher resolution ($m_{\rm b} \approx 10^4$~M$\odot$) that aim to self-consistently study the back-reaction of reionization on galaxies.</description>

We perform three-dimensional simulations of magnetorotational supernovae using a $39,M_{\odot}$ progenitor star with two different initial magnetic field strengths of $10^{10}$ G and $10^{12}$ G in the core. Both models rapidly undergo shock revival and their explosion energies asymptote within a few hundred milliseconds to values of $\gtrsim 2\times10^{51}$ erg after conservatively correcting for the binding energy of the envelope. Magnetically collimated, non-relativistic jets form in both models, though the jets are subject to non-axisymmetric instabilities.</description>

Spiral galaxies undergo strong ram-pressure effects when they fall into the galaxy cluster potential. As a consequence, their gas is stripped to form extended tails within which star formation can happen, giving them the typical jellyfish appearance. The ultraviolet imaging observations of jellyfish galaxies provide an opportunity to understand ongoing star formation in the stripped tails. We report the ultraviolet observations of the jellyfish galaxies JW39, JO60, JO194 and compare with observations in optical continuum and $\mathrm{H}{\alpha}$.</description>

Globular clusters contain multiple stellar populations, with some previous generation of stars polluting the current stars with heavier elements. Understanding the history of globular clusters is helpful in understanding how galaxies merged and evolved and therefore constraining the site or sites of this historic pollution is a priority. The acceptable temperature and density conditions of these polluting sites depend on critical &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;search-hit mathjax&amp;quot;&amp;gt;reaction&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; rates. In this paper, three experimental studies helping to constrain astrophysically important &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;search-hit mathjax&amp;quot;&amp;gt;reaction&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; rates are briefly discussed.</description>

We develop a novel general formalism allowing us to obtain values of the Hubble constant in agreement with late-time observables without degrading the fit to Cosmic Microwave Background data, considering perturbative modifications around a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Taking as proof-of-principle the case of a time-varying electron mass and fine structure constant, we demonstrate that a modified recombination can solve the Hubble tension and lower $S_8$ to match weak lensing measurements.</description>
