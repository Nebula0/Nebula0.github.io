      <description>First author: Xiaolong Yang
We conducted a Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observation of the low mass active galactic nucleus (AGN) in galaxy NGC 4293 ($z=0.003$). The object is associated with a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER). Its black hole mass is estimated as $\sim10^5$ or $\sim10^7 M_\odot$. The VLBA 1.5 GHz image shows an inverse symmetric structure with two discrete radio blobs separated by an angular distance of $\sim120$ mas, corresponding to $\sim7$ parsec.</description>

We present JWST near- and mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of the nearby normal Type Ia supernova SN 2021aefx in the nebular phase at $+255$ days past maximum light. Our Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI) observations, combined with ground-based optical data from the South African Large Telescope (SALT), constitute the first complete optical $+$ NIR $+$ MIR nebular SN Ia spectrum covering 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Kenji Bekki
We discuss the mechanism(s) of bar formation in isolated and tidally interacting disk galaxies using the results of idealized collisionless Nbody simulations of the galaxies. In order to better understand the mechanism, we investigate orbital eccentricities (e), epochs of apocenter passages (t_a), azimuthal angles at t_a (varphi_a), precession rates (Omega_pre), for individual stars, as well as bar strengths represented by relative m=2 Fourier amplitude (A_2) and bar pattern speeds (Omega_bar).</description>

      <description>First author: Shin&amp;rsquo;ichirou Yoshida
Rotation may affect the occurrence of sustainable hydrogen burning in very low-mass stellar objects by the introduction of centrifugal force to the hydrostatic balance as well as by the appearance of rotational break-up of the objects (mass-shedding limit) for rapidly rotating cases. We numerically construct the models of rotating very low-mass stellar objects that may or may not experience sustained nuclear reaction (hydrogen-burning) as their energy source.</description>

      <description>First author: Fabio Pacucci
A supermassive black hole (SMBH) of $\sim 3\times 10^6 , \rm M_\odot$ was recently detected via dynamical measurements at the center of the dwarf galaxy Leo I. Standing $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude above standard scaling relations, this SMBH is hosted by a galaxy devoid of gas and with no significant star formation in the last $\sim 1$ Gyr. This detection can profoundly impact the formation models for black holes and their hosts.</description>

      <description>First author: Michael J. Wilensky
We present a Bayesian jackknife test for assessing the probability that a data set contains biased subsets, and, if so, which of the subsets are likely to be biased. The test can be used to assess the presence and likely source of statistical tension between different measurements of the same quantities in an automated manner. Under certain broadly applicable assumptions, the test is analytically tractable.</description>

      <description>First author: Pablo G. Pérez-González
The new capabilities that JWST offers in the near- and mid-infrared (IR) are used to investigate in unprecedented detail the nature of optical/near-IR faint, mid-IR bright sources, the so-called HST-dark galaxies among them. We gather JWST data from the CEERS survey in the EGS, jointly with HST data, to face this task by analyzing spatially resolved optical-to-mid-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to estimate both photometric redshifts and stellar populations properties in two dimensions.</description>

      <description>First author: M. Schmassmann
We analyse a sunspot simulation in an effort to understand the origin of the convective instabilities giving rise to the penumbral and umbral distinct regimes. We applied the criterion from Gough &amp;amp; Tayler (1966), accounting for the stabilising effect of the vertical magnetic field to investigate the convective instabilities in a MURaM sunspot simulation. We find: (1) a highly unstable shallow layer right beneath the surface extending all over the simulation box in which convection is triggered by radiative cooling in the photosphere; (2) a deep umbral core (beneath -5 Mm) stabilised against overturning convection that underlies a region with stable background values permeated by slender instabilities coupled to umbral dots; (3) filamentary instabilities below the penumbra nearly parallel to the surface and undulating instabilities coupled to the penumbra which originate in the deep layers.</description>

      <title>Circumbinary Accretion: From Binary Stars to Massive Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>First author: Dong Lai
We review recent works on the dynamics of circumbinary accretion, including time variability, angular momentum transfer between the disk and the binary, and the secular evolution of accreting binaries. These dynamics can impact stellar binary formation/evolution, circumbinary planet formation/migration, and the evolution of (super)massive black-hole binaries. We discuss the dynamics and evolution of inclined/warped circumbinary disks and connect with recent observations of protoplanetary disks. A special kind of circumbinary accretion involves binaries embedded in &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; disks, which may contribute to the mergers of stellar-mass black holes in AGN disks.</description>

      <description>First author: Sahl Rowther
We carry out three dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to study the impact of planet-disc interactions on a gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disc. We find that the impact of a planet on the disc&amp;rsquo;s evolution can be described by three scenarios. If the planet is sufficiently massive, the spiral wakes generated by the planet dominate the evolution of the disc and gravitational instabilities are completely suppressed. If the planet&amp;rsquo;s mass is too small, then gravitational instabilities are unaffected.</description>

      <description>First author: Iván Muñoz Rodríguez
This paper explores the role of small-scale environment ($&amp;lt;1$ Mpc) in modulating accretion events onto supermassive black holes by studying the incidence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in massive clusters of galaxies. A flexible, data-driven semi-empirical model is developed based on a minimal set of parameters and under the zero order assumption that the incidence of AGN in galaxies is independent of environment. This is used to predict how the fraction of X-ray selected AGN among galaxies in massive dark matter halos ($\gtrsim 3\times 10^{14},M_{\odot}$) evolves with redshift and reveal tensions with observations.</description>

      <description>First author: Carlos Mauricio Correa
Cosmic voids are promising cosmological laboratories for studying the dark energy phenomenon and alternative gravity theories. They are receiving special attention nowadays in view of the new generation of galaxy spectroscopic surveys, which are covering an unprecedented volume and redshift range. There are two primary statistics in void studies: (i) the void size function, which characterises the abundance of voids, and (ii) the void-galaxy cross-correlation function, which contains information about the density and velocity fields in these regions.</description>

We present the effective-field theory (EFT)-based cosmological full-shape analysis of the anisotropic power spectrum of eBOSS quasars at the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=1.48$. We perform extensive tests of our pipeline on simulations, paying a particular attention to the modeling of observational systematics, such as redshift smearing, fiber collisions, and the radial integral constraint. Assuming the minimal $\Lambda$CDM model, and fixing the primordial power spectrum tilt and the physical baryon density, we find the Hubble constant $H_0=(66.</description>

We conduct a systematic search for protocluster candidates at $z \geq 6$ in the COSMOS field using the recently released COSMOS2020 source catalog. We select galaxies using a number of selection criteria to obtain a sample of galaxies that have a high probability of being inside a given redshift bin. We then apply overdensity analysis to the bins using two density estimators, a Weighted Adaptive Kernel Estimator and a Weighted Voronoi Tessellation Estimator.</description>

We describe the fast transient classification algorithm in the center of the kilonova (KN) science module currently implemented in the Fink broker and report classification results based on simulated catalogs and real data from the ZTF alert stream. We used noiseless, homogeneously sampled simulations to construct a basis of principal components (PCs). All light curves from a more realistic ZTF simulation were written as a linear combination of this basis.</description>

      <description>First author: Enrique Lopez-Rodriguez
Mergers are thought to be a fundamental channel for galaxy growth, perturbing the gas dynamics and the magnetic fields (B-fields) in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the mechanisms that amplify and dissipate B-fields during a merger remain unclear. We characterize the morphology of the ordered B-fields in the multi-phase ISM of the closest merger of two spiral galaxies, the Antennae galaxies. We compare the inferred B-fields using $154~\mu$m thermal dust and $11$ cm radio synchrotron emission polarimetric observations.</description>

      <description>First author: Taeho Ryu
Extreme tidal disruption events (eTDEs), which occur when a star passes very close to a supermassive black hole, may provide a way to observe a long-sought general relativistic effect: orbits that wind several times around a black hole and then leave. Through general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, we show that such eTDEs are easily distinguished from most tidal disruptions, in which stars come close, but not so close, to the black hole.</description>

      <description>First author: Jiacheng Meng
We use the most recent data release (DR9) of the DESI legacy imaging survey and SDSS galaxy groups to measure the conditional luminosity function (CLF) for groups with halo mass $M_{\rm h}\ge 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ and redshift $0.01\le z\le 0.08$, down to a limiting $r$-band magnitude of $M_{\rm r}=-10\sim-12$. For a given halo mass we measure the CLF for the total satellite population, as well as separately for the red and blue populations classified using the $(g-z)$ color.</description>

We use the most recent data release (DR9) of the DESI legacy imaging survey and SDSS galaxy groups to measure the conditional luminosity function (CLF) for groups with halo mass $M_{\rm h}\ge 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ and redshift $0.01\le z\le 0.08$, down to a limiting $r$-band magnitude of $M_{\rm r}=-10\sim-12$. For a given halo mass we measure the CLF for the total satellite population, as well as separately for the red and blue populations classified using the $(g-z)$ color.</description>

      <description>First author: Arnab Sarkar
We present deep Chandra observations of the pre-merger galaxy cluster Abell 98. Abell 98 is a complex merging system. While the northern (A98N) and central subclusters (A98S) are merging along the north-south direction, A98S is undergoing a separate late-stage merger, with two distinct X-ray cores. We report detection of gas sloshing spirals in A98N and in the eastern core of A98S. We detect two cold front edges in A98N.</description>

Solar flares are some of the most energetic events in the solar system and can be studied to investigate the physics of plasmas and stellar processes. One interesting aspect of solar flares is the presence of accelerated (nonthermal) particles, whose signatures appear in solar flare hard X-ray emissions. Debate has been ongoing since the early days of the space age as to how these particles are accelerated, and one way to probe relevant acceleration mechanisms is by investigating short-timescale (tens of milliseconds) variations in solar flare hard X-ray flux.</description>

Sheth-Tormen mass function has been widely used to quantify the abundance of dark matter halos. It is a significant improvement over the Press-Schechter mass function as it uses ellipsoidal collapse in place of spherical collapse. Both of these mass functions can be written in a form that is universal, i.e., independent of cosmology and power spectrum when scaled in suitable variables. However, cosmological simulations have shown that this universality is approximate.</description>

At least one major merger is currently taking place in the MW. The Sgr dwarf spheroidal galaxy is being tidally destroyed while orbiting around the MW, whose close passages perturb the MW disc externally. In this work, using a series of hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate how massive dwarf galaxies on quasi-polar Sgr-like orbits impact the star formation activity inside the MW-like discs. First, we confirm that interactions with orbiting satellites enhance the star formation rate in the host galaxy.</description>

Gravitational collapse of dark matter overdensities leads to the formation of dark matter halos which embed galaxies and galaxy clusters. An intriguing feature of dark matter halos is that their density profiles closely follow a universal form irrespective of the initial condition or the corresponding growth history. This represents a class of dynamical systems with emergent universalities. We propose an iterative mean-field approach&#39;&#39; to compute the solutions of the gravitational collapse dynamics.</description>

We report the detection of magnesium dicarbide, MgC$_2$, in the laboratory at centimeter wavelengths and assign $^{24}$MgC$_2$, $^{25}$MgC$_2$, and $^{26}$MgC$_2$ to 14 unidentified lines in the radio spectrum of the circumstellar envelope of the evolved carbon star IRC+10216. The structure of MgC$_2$ is found to be T-shaped with a highly ionic bond between the metal atom and the C$_2$ unit, analogous to other dicarbides containing electropositive elements.</description>

The motion of cosmic strings in the universe leads to the generation of wakes behind them. We study magnetized wakes of cosmic strings moving in the post recombination plasma. We show that magnetic reconnection can occur in the post shock region. Since the width of the cosmic string wake is very small, the reconnection occurs over a very short lengthscale. The reconnection leads to a large amount of kinetic energy being released in the post shock region of the cosmic string wake.</description>

      <description>First author: André Oliva
Like their lower mass siblings, massive protostars can be expected to: a) be surrounded by circumstellar disks and b) launch magnetically-driven jets and outflows. The disk formation and global evolution is thereby controlled by advection of angular momentum from large scales, the efficiency of magnetic braking and the resistivity of the medium, and the internal thermal and magnetic pressures of the disk. We perform a series of 30 simulations of a massive star forming from the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud threaded by an initially-uniform magnetic field, starting from different values for the mass of the cloud, its initial density and rotation profiles, its rotational energy content, the magnetic field strength, and the resistivity of the material.</description>

Quasar-galaxy pairs at small separations are important probes of gas flows in the disk-halo interface in galaxies. We study host galaxies of 198 MgII absorbers at $0.39\le z_{abs}\le1.05$ that show detectable nebular emission lines in the SDSS spectra. We report measurements of impact parameter (5.9$\le D[kpc]\le$16.9) and absolute B-band magnitude ($-18.7\le {\rm M_B}\le -22.3$ mag) of host galaxies of 74 of these absorbers using multi-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey, more than doubling the number of known host galaxies with $D\le17$ kpc.</description>

      <description>First author: James A. Klimchuk
It is extremely difficult to simulate the details of coronal heating and also make meaningful predictions of the emitted radiation. Thus, testing realistic models with observations is a major challenge. Observational signatures of coronal heating depend crucially on radiation, thermal conduction, and the exchange of mass and energy with the transition region and chromosphere below. Many magnetohydrodynamic simulation studies do not include these effects, opting instead to devote computational resources to the magnetic aspects of the problem.</description>

Machine learning (ML) models can greatly improve the search for strong gravitational lenses in imaging surveys by reducing the amount of human inspection required. In this work, we test the performance of supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning algorithms trained with the ResNetV2 neural network architecture on their ability to efficiently find strong gravitational lenses in the Deep Lens Survey (DLS). We use galaxy images from the survey, combined with simulated lensed sources, as labeled data in our training datasets.</description>

      <description>First author: Xiaolong Yang
Observational searches for intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $10^2 - 10^6$ $M_\odot$) include relatively isolated dwarf galaxies. For those that host active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the IMBH nature may be discerned through the accretion - jet activity. We present radio observations of four AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies (which potentially harbor IMBHs). Very large array (VLA) observations indicate steep spectra (indices of $-$0.63 to $-$1.05) between 1.4 and 9 GHz.</description>

We analyse the quenched fractions, gas content, and star formation histories of ~1200 satellite galaxies with M* &amp;gt;= 5x10^6 Msun around 198 Milky Way- (MW) and Andromeda-like (M31) hosts in TNG50, the highest-resolution run of the IllustrisTNG simulations. Satellites exhibit larger quenched fractions for smaller masses, at smaller distances to their host galaxy, and in the more massive M31-like compared to MW-like hosts. As satellites cross their host&amp;rsquo;s virial radius, their gas content drops significantly: most satellites within 300 kpc do not contain any detectable gas reservoirs at z=0, unless they are massive like the Magellanic Clouds and M32.</description>

      <description>First author: Rubén M. Cabezón
In this work, we study whether the engulfment of a brown dwarf (BD) by a solar-like main-sequence (MS) star can significantly alter the structure of the star and the Li content on its surface. We perform 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of the engulfment of a BD with masses 0.01 and 0.019 Msun, onto an MS star of 1 Msun and solar composition, in three different scenarios: a head-on collision, a grazing collision, and a merger.</description>

The mechanism to produce the numerous Galactic-Centre filaments (GCF) that vertically penetrate the Galactic plane without clear evidence of connection to the disc remains a mystery . Here we show that the GCFs are explained by relics of supernova remnants (rSNR) driven by hundreds of supernovae (SNe) exploded in the star-forming ring of the central molecular zone (CMZ) at an SN rate of $\sim 2\times 10^{-4}$ y$^{-1}$ in the past $\sim 0.</description>

We analyze the physical properties of gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 132 Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies at $z=0$ from the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50, part of the IllustrisTNG project. The properties and abundance of CGM gas across the sample are diverse, and the fractional budgets of different phases (cold, warm, and hot), as well as neutral HI mass and metal mass, vary considerably. Over our stellar mass range of $10.</description>

      <description>First author: Michael Ray
Both long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are expected to occur in the dense environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. As these bursts propagate through the disks they live in, they photoionize the medium causing time-dependent opacity that results in transients with unique spectral evolution. In this paper we use a line-of-sight radiation transfer code coupling metal and dust evolution to simulate the time-dependent absorption that occurs in the case of both long and short GRBs.</description>

The neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) mass function (HIMF) describes the distribution of the HI content of galaxies at any epoch; its evolution provides an important probe of models of galaxy formation and evolution. Here, we report Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope HI 21cm spectroscopy of blue star-forming galaxies at $z\approx0.20-0.42$ in the Extended Groth Strip, which has allowed us to determine the scaling relation between the average HI mass ($\rm{M_{HI}}$) and the absolute B-band magnitude ($\rm{M_B}$) of such galaxies at $z \approx 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Diego Sotillo-Ramos
We analyze the merger and assembly histories of Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31)-like galaxies to quantify how, and how often, disk galaxies of this mass can survive recent major mergers (stellar mass ratio $\ge$ 1:4). For this, we use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 and identify 198 analog galaxies, selected based on their $z=0$ stellar mass ($10^{10.5-11.2} {\rm M_{\odot}}$), disky stellar morphology and local environment.</description>

With a unique set of 54 overlapping narrow-band and two broader filters covering the entire optical range, the incoming Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) will provide a great opportunity for stellar physics and near-field cosmology. In this work, we use the miniJPAS data in 56 J-PAS filters and 4 complementary SDSS-like filters to explore and prove the potential of the J-PAS filter system in characterizing stars and deriving their atmospheric parameters.</description>

The James Webb Space Telescope&amp;rsquo;s Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (JWST-NIRISS) flies a 7-hole non-redundant mask (NRM), the first such interferometer in space, operating at 3-5 \micron~wavelengths, and a bright limit of $\simeq 4$ magnitudes in W2. We describe the NIRISS Aperture Masking Interferometry (AMI) mode to help potential observers understand its underlying principles, present some sample science cases, explain its operational observing strategies, indicate how AMI proposals can be developed with data simulations, and how AMI data can be analyzed.</description>

Feeding with gas in streams is predicted to be an important galaxy growth mechanism. Using an idealised setup, we study the impact of stream feeding (with 10$^7$ M${\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ rate) on the star formation and outflows of disc galaxies with $\sim$10$^{11}$ M${\odot}$ baryonic mass. The magneto-hydrodynamical simulations are carried out with the PIERNIK code and include star formation, feedback from supernova, and cosmic ray advection and diffusion.</description>

We present a new planetary global circulation model, planetMPAS, based on the state-of-the-art NCAR MPAS General Circulation Model. Taking advantage of the cross compatibility between WRF and MPAS, planetMPAS includes most of the planetWRF physics parameterization schemes for terrestrial planets such as Mars and Titan. PlanetMPAS also includes a set of physics that represents radiative transfer, dry convection, moist convection and its associated microphysics for the Jovian atmosphere.</description>

      <description>First author: Li-Hsin Chen
We analyse the location of extremely metal-poor stars (EMPs, [Fe/H]$ &amp;lt; -3$) in 198 Milky Way (MW)/M31-like galaxies at $z=0$ in the TNG50 simulation. Each system is divided into four kinematically-defined morphological stellar components based on stellar circularity and galactocentric distance, namely bulge, cold disk, warm disk, and stellar halo, in addition to satellites (with stellar mass $\ge 5\times10^6,M_\odot$). According to TNG50 and across all simulated systems, the stellar halo of the main galaxy and satellites present the highest frequency of EMPs (largest $M_{\mathrm{EMP, comp}}$-to-$M_{\mathrm{tot, comp}}$ stellar mass ratio), and thus the highest chances of finding them.</description>

Recent surveys have discovered a population of faint supernovae, known as Ca-rich gap transients, inferred to originate from explosive ignitions of white dwarfs. In addition to their unique spectra and luminosities, these supernovae have an unusual spatial distribution and are predominantly found at large distances from their presumed host galaxies. We show that the locations of Ca-rich gap transients are well matched to the distribution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies surrounding large galaxies, in accordance with a scenario where dark matter interactions induce thermonuclear explosions among low-mass white dwarfs that may be otherwise difficult to ignite with standard stellar or binary evolution mechanisms.</description>

      <description>First author: Christian Eistrup
[Abridged] This review paper discussed which chemical effects may be at play in a planet-forming disk midplane, which effects are relevant under different conditions, and which tools are available for modelling chemical kinetics in a disk midplane. The review goes on to discuss some important efforts in the planet formation modelling community to treat chemical evolution, and, vice versa, efforts in the chemical modelling community to implement more physical effects related to planet formation into the chemical modelling.</description>

The free-free absorption of low frequency radio waves by thermal electrons in the warm ionized medium of our Galaxy becomes very significant at $\lesssim 10$ MHz (ultralong-wavelength), and the absorption strength depends on the radio frequency. Upcoming space experiments such as the Discovering Sky at the Longest wavelength (DSL) and Farside Array for Radio Science Investigations of the Dark ages and Exoplanets (FARSIDE) will produce high-resolution multi-frequency sky maps at the ultralong-wavelength, providing a new window to observe the Universe.</description>

      <description>First author: Ji-Hoon Ha
Cosmology models predict that external accretion shocks form in the outer region of galaxy clusters due to supersonic gas infall from filaments and voids in the cosmic web. They are characterized by high sonic and Alfv&#39;enic Mach numbers, $M_s\sim10-10^2$ and $M_A\sim10^2-10^3$, and propagate into weakly magnetized plasmas of $\beta\equiv P_g/P_B\gtrsim10^2$. Although strong accretion shocks are expected to be efficient accelerators of cosmic rays (CRs), nonthermal signatures of shock-accelerated CRs around clusters have not been confirmed, and detailed acceleration physics at such shocks has yet to be understood.</description>

Observations of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems have enabled unique tests of nonlinear departures from general relativity (GR) on the galactic and supergalactic scales. One of the most important cases of such tests is constraints on the gravitational slip between two scalar gravitational potentials. In this paper, we use a newly compiled sample of strong gravitational lenses to test the validity of GR, focusing on the screening effects on the apparent positions of lensed sources relative to the GR predictions.</description>

We report the discovery of two companion sources to a strongly lensed galaxy SPT0418-47 (&amp;ldquo;ring&amp;rdquo;) at redshift 4.225, targeted by the JWST Early Release Science program. We confirm that these sources are at a similar redshift as the ring based on H$\alpha$ detected in the NIRSpec spectrum, and [C II] 158 $\mu$m line from ALMA. Using multiple spectral lines detected in JWST/NIRSpec, the rest-frame optical to infrared images from NIRCam and MIRI, and far-infrared (FIR) dust continuum detected by ALMA, we argue that the newly discovered sources are actually lensed images of the same companion galaxy, hereafter referred to as SPT0418-SE (&amp;ldquo;SE&amp;rdquo;), located within 5 kpc in the source plane of the ring.</description>

      <description>First author: Isaac Noel
The low-redshift mass-metallicity relation (MZR) is well studied, but the high-redshift MZR remains difficult to observe. To study the early MZR further, we analyze the Cosmic Reionization on Computers (CROC) simulations with a focus on the MZR from redshifts 5 to 10. We find that, across all redshifts, CROC galaxies exhibit similar stellar-phase and gas-phase MZRs that flatten with higher stellar mass. We attribute this flattening to the inaccurate star formation and feedback modeling in CROC (star formation is overly suppressed in massive CROC galaxies).</description>

      <description>First author: Debanjan Sarkar
The fluctuations in the dark matter-baryon relative velocity field are imprinted as acoustic oscillations in the 21-cm power spectrum during cosmic dawn (CD). These velocity acoustic oscillations (VAOs) keep the imprints of the comoving sound horizon scale. In a previous work by Mu~noz, it has been demonstrated that these VAOs can be treated as standard rulers to measure the cosmic expansion rate at high redshifts by considering a variety of Lyman-Werner feedback strengths and foreground contamination scenarios.</description>

      <description>First author: Yunwei Deng
Supernovae and their remnants provide energetic feedback to the ambient interstellar medium (ISM), which is often distributed in multiple gas phases. Among them, warm molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) often dominates the cooling of the shocked molecular ISM, which has been observed with the H$_2$ emission lines at near-infrared wavelengths. Such studies, however, were either limited in narrow filter imaging or sparsely sampled mid-infrared spectroscopic observations with relatively poor angular resolutions.</description>

      <description>First author: Adam F. Kowalski
White-light stellar flares are now reported by the thousands in long-baseline, high precision, broad-band photometry from missions like Kepler, K2, and TESS. These observations are crucial inputs for assessments of biosignatures in exoplanetary atmospheres and surface ultraviolet radiation dosages for habitable zone planets around low-mass stars. A limitation of these assessments, however, is the lack of near-ultraviolet spectral observations of stellar flares. To motivate further empirical investigation, we use a grid of radiative-hydrodynamic simulations with an updated treatment of the pressure broadening of hydrogen lines to predict the $\lambda \approx 1800-3300$ \AA</description>

      <description>First author: Vladimir Zhdankin
We demonstrate using linear theory and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations that a synchrotron-cooling collisionless plasma acquires pressure anisotropy and, if the plasma beta is sufficiently high, becomes unstable to the firehose instability, in a process that we dub the synchrotron firehose instability (SFHI). The SFHI channels free energy from the pressure anisotropy of the radiating, relativistic electrons (and/or positrons) into small-amplitude, kinetic-scale magnetic-field fluctuations, which pitch-angle scatter the particles and bring the plasma to a near-thermal state of marginal instability.</description>

      <description>First author: N. Bartel
We observed the scintillation pattern of nine bright pulsars at 324 MHz and three at 1.68 GHz and analyzed the wavenumber spectrum which is related to electron density variations of the plasma turbulence of the interstellar medium. For all pulsars the frequency section of the autocorrelation function of the dynamic spectra to at least 45% of the maximum corresponds to predictions of scattering theories with a range of power-law exponents of the wavenumber spectrum of $3.</description>

We present a sample of 373 peaked-spectrum (PS) sources with spectral peaks around 150MHz, selected using a subset of two LOFAR all-sky surveys, the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey and the LOFAR LBA Sky Survey. These surveys are the most sensitive low-frequency widefield surveys to date, allowing us to select low-luminosity PS sources. Our sample increases the number of known PS sources in our survey area by a factor 50.</description>

The intermediate mass black hole range, $10\lesssim M_{\rm BH}^{}/M_\odot^{}\lesssim 10^{5} $, has long offered enticing possibilities for primordial black holes (PBH), with populations in this range postulated to be responsible for some of the LIGO binary merger detected events as well as the existence of supermassive black holes embedded at galactic centers. However, a prominent bound derived from PBH accretion during recombination severely restricts the mass fraction of intermediate mass PBH.</description>

We examine the flux density ratio anomaly in the quadruply-imaged strong gravitational lens, B1422+231, and consider the contribution of $10-10^3M_{\odot}$ primordial black holes (PBHs) as a potential dark matter constituent. We describe the first flux density ratio measurement of B1422+231 in the millimeter-wave band using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). This fills an important multi-wavelength gap in our knowledge of this key lensed system. The flux density of the quasar at 233 GHz is dominated by synchrotron emission and the source size is estimated to be 66.</description>

The connection between the escape fraction of ionizing radiation ($f_{esc}$) and the properties of galaxies, such as stellar mass (M*), age, star-formation rate (SFR), and dust content, are key inputs for reionization models, but many of these relationships remain untested at high redshift. We present an analysis of a sample of 96 z~3 galaxies from the Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic Survey (KLCS). These galaxies have both sensitive Keck/LRIS spectroscopic measurements of the Lyman continuum (LyC) region, and multi-band photometry that places constraints on stellar population parameters.</description>
