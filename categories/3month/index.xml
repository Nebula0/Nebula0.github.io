      <description>First author: Alex Camilo Gormaz-Matamala
Mass loss due to line-driven winds is central to our understanding of the evolution of massive stars. We extend the evolution models introduced in Paper I, where the mass loss recipe is based on the simultaneous calculation of the wind hydrodynamics and the line-acceleration, by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation. We introduce a grid of self-consistent line-force parameters for a set of standard evolutionary tracks.</description>

      <description>First author: D. Vohl
The vast majority of extragalactic, compact continuum radio sources are associated with star formation or jets from (super)massive black holes and, as such, are more likely to be found in association with starburst galaxies or early type galaxies. Recently, two new populations of radio sources have been identified: (a) compact and persistent sources (PRS) associated with fast radio bursts (FRB) in dwarf galaxies and (b) compact sources in dwarf galaxies that could belong to the long-sought population of intermediate-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>A long-duration gamma-ray burst of dynamical origin from the nucleus of an ancient galaxy</title>

      <description>First author: Andrew J. Levan
The majority of long duration ($&amp;gt;2$ s) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to arise from the collapse of massive stars \cite{Hjorth+03}, with a small proportion created from the merger of compact objects. Most of these systems are likely formed via standard stellar evolution pathways. However, it has long been thought that a fraction of GRBs may instead be an outcome of dynamical interactions in dense environments, channels which could also contribute significantly to the samples of compact object mergers detected as gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <description>First author: Gokul P. Srinivasaragavan
We report observations of the optical counterpart of the long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) GRB 221009A. Due to the extreme rarity of being both nearby ($z = 0.151$) and highly energetic ($E_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso}} \geq 10^{54}$ erg), GRB 221009A offers a unique opportunity to probe the connection between massive star core collapse and relativistic jet formation. Adopting a phenomenological power-law model for the afterglow and host galaxy estimates from high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we use Bayesian model comparison techniques to determine the likelihood of an associated SN contributing excess flux to the optical light curve.</description>

      <description>First author: Gopika K.
A large number of observations have shown that the dark matter halo surface density, given by the product of halo core radius and core density is nearly constant for a diverse suite of galaxies. Although this invariance of the halo surface density is violated at galaxy cluster and group scales, it is still an open question on whether the aforementioned constancy on galactic scales can be explained within $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>First author: Polychronis Papaderos
Since the k correction depends on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy, any high-z galaxy with a spatially non-homogeneous SED will experience a spatially varying relative dimming or brightening in addition to the pure distance effect. The morphology of galaxies will therefore change with z. For instance, an early spiral galaxy observed in the V band would show a prominent bulge at z=0, whereas, if at z=1, the V filter probes the rest-frame near-UV where the bulge is faint and the disk relatively brighter, thus the galaxy may appear as bulgeless.</description>

      <description>First author: Jos√© Ferreira
In this dissertation, we study two cosmological models based on $f(Q)$ gravity. We resort to mock catalogs of standard siren (SS) events to see whether data from future gravitational wave (GWs) observatories will be able to distinguish these models from $\Lambda$CDM. The first model is the most general $f(Q)$ formulation that replicates a $\Lambda$CDM background, with deviations appearing only at the perturbative level. It has one additional free parameter compared to $\Lambda$CDM, $\alpha$, which when set to zero falls back to $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>First author: C. Spingola
Current cosmological controversies can be solved if a sufficient level of precision is achieved by observations. Future surveys with the next generation of telescopes will offer significantly improved depth and angular resolution with respect to existing observations, opening the so-called &amp;ldquo;era of precision cosmology&amp;rdquo;. But, that era can be considered already started at the radio wavelengths with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In this paper, we give an overview on how VLBI is contributing to some open questions in contemporary cosmology by reaching simultaneously the largest distances and the smallest scales.</description>

      <description>First author: Yi Xu
We present demography of the dynamics and gas-mass fraction of 33 extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs) with metallicities of $0.015-0.195~Z_\odot$ and low stellar masses of $10^4-10^8~M_\odot$ in the local universe. We conduct deep optical integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) for the low-mass EMPGs with the medium high resolution ($R=7500$) grism of the 8m-Subaru FOCAS IFU instrument by the EMPRESS 3D survey, and investigate H$\alpha$ emission of the EMPGs. Exploiting the resolution high enough for the low-mass galaxies, we derive gas dynamics with the H$\alpha$ lines by the fitting of 3-dimensional disk models.</description>

      <description>First author: Alexander R. Livernois
The dynamics of binary stars provides a unique avenue to gather insight into the study of the structure and dynamics of star clusters and galaxies. In this paper, we present the results of a set of $N$-body simulations aimed at exploring the evolution of binary stars during the early evolutionary phases of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFD). In our simulations, we assume that the stellar component of the UFD is initially dynamically cold and evolves towards its final equilibrium after undergoing the violent relaxation phase.</description>

      <description>Davide Lazzati
Long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), canonically separated at around 2 seconds duration, are associated with different progenitors: the collapse of a massive star and the merger of two compact objects, respectively. GRB 191019A was a long GRB ($T_{90}\sim64$ s). Despite the relatively small redshift z=0.248 and HST followup observations, an accompanying supernova was not detected. In addition, the host galaxy did not have significant star formation activity.</description>

      <description>First author: Qiliang Fang
The relation between the progenitor mass and the kinetic energy of the explosion is a key toward revealing the explosion mechanism of stripped-envelope (SE) core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe). Here, we present a method to derive this relation using the nebular spectra of SESNe, based on the correlation between the $[O~I]$/$[Ca~II]$, which is an indicator of the progenitor mass, and the width of $[O~I]$, which measures the expansion velocity of the oxygen-rich material.</description>

Of these detections, 134 (80%) of the millimeter counterparts are first-time identifications with ACT. We expand the previous ACT extragalactic source catalogs, by including new 98 GHz detections and measurements from ACT DR5.</description>

      <description>First author: Ryan K. Alexander
Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are among the oldest and most metal-poor galaxies in the cosmos, observed to contain no traces of gas at the present time and a high dark matter mass fraction. Understanding the chemical abundance dispersion in such extreme environments could shed light on the properties of the first generations of stars in the cosmos. We present a novel inhomogeneous chemical evolution model, i-GEtool, that we apply to two ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, Carina II (Car II) and Reticulum II (Ret II), which are satellites of the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

Core-collapse supernova remnants are structures of the interstellar medium (ISM) left behind the explosive death of most massive stars (smaller or equal to 40 Mo). Since they result in the expansion of the supernova shock wave into the gaseous environment shaped by the star wind history, their morphology constitutes an insight into the past evolution of their progenitor star. Particularly, fast-moving massive stars can produce asymmetric core-collapse supernova remnants.</description>

      <description>First author: M. Obergaulinger
In contrast to regular core-collapse supernovae, explosions of rapidly rotating massive stars can develop jets, fast collimated outflows directed along the rotational axis. Depending on the rate of rotation and the magnetic field strength before collapse as well as on possible mechanisms amplifying the magnetic field, such a core can explode magnetorotationally rather than via the standard supernova mechanism based on neutrino heating. This scenario can explain the highest kinetic energies observed in the class of hypernovae.</description>

      <description>First author: Floor van Donkelaar
Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are massive star clusters found in the innermost region of the majority of galaxies. While recent studies suggest that low-mass NSCs in dwarf galaxies form largely out of the merger of globular clusters and NSCs in massive galaxies have assembled most of their mass through central star formation, the formation channel of the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s NSC is still uncertain. In this work, we use GigaEris, a very high resolution $N$-body hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in&#39;&#39; simulation, to investigate NSC formation in the progenitor of a Milky Way-sized galaxy, as well as its relation to the assembly and evolution of the galactic nuclear region.</description>

We study the formation of globular clusters in massive compact clouds with the low-metallicity of $Z=10^{-3}~Z_{\odot}$ by performing three-dimensional radiative-hydrodynamics simulations. Considering the uncertainty of the initial mass function (IMF) of stars formed in low-metallicity and high-density clouds, we investigate the impacts of the IMF on the cloud condition for the GC formation with the range of the power-law index of IMF as $Œ≥= 1-2.35$. We find that the threshold surface density ($Œ£_{\rm thr}$) for the GC formation increases from $800~M_{\odot} \; {\rm pc^{-2}}$ at $Œ≥= 2.</description>

Without AGN feedback, simulated massive, star-forming galaxies become too compact relative to observed galaxies at z&amp;lt;2. In this paper, we perform high-resolution re-simulations of a massive (M*~10^11M_sol) galaxy at z~2, drawn from the FIRE project. In the simulation without AGN feedback, the galaxy experiences a rapid starburst and shrinking of its half-mass radius at z~2.3. In this paper, we experiment with driving mechanical AGN winds using a state-of-the-art hyper-Lagrangian refinement technique to increase particle resolution.</description>

Direct collapse of supermassive stars is a possible pathway to form supermassive black hole seeds at high redshifts. Whereas previous three-dimensional (3D) simulations demonstrate that supermassive stars form via rapid mass accretion, those resolving the stellar interior have been limited. We here report 3D radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations following the evolution of rapidly accreting protostars resolving the stellar interior. We use an adaptive mesh refinement code with our newly developed RHD solver employing an explicit M1 closure method.</description>

We apply the full set of most update dynamical and geometrical data in cosmology to the nonextensive Barrow entropic holographic dark energy. We show that the data point towards an extensive Gibbs-like entropic behaviour for the cosmological horizons, which is the extreme case of the Barrow entropy, with the entropy parameter being $\Delta &amp;gt; 0.86$, close to the maximum threshold of $\Delta =1$ where the fractal dimension of the area-horizon becomes almost or just the volume and the intensivity is recovered.</description>

We present the Cardinal mock galaxy catalogs, a new version of the Buzzard simulation that has been updated to support ongoing and future cosmological surveys, including DES, DESI, and LSST. These catalogs are based on a one-quarter sky simulation populated with galaxies out to a redshift of $z=2.35$ to a depth of $m_{\rm{r}}=27$.

      <title>Comparison of Polarized Radiative Transfer Codes used by the EHT Collaboration</title>

Interpretation of resolved polarized images of black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) requires predictions of the polarized emission observable by an Earth-based instrument for a particular model of the black hole accretion system. Such predictions are generated by general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) codes, which integrate the equations of polarized radiative transfer in curved spacetime. A selection of ray-tracing GRRT codes used within the EHT collaboration is evaluated for accuracy and consistency in producing a selection of test images, demonstrating that the various methods and implementations of radiative transfer calculations are highly consistent.</description>

Semi-numerical simulations are the leading candidates for evolving reionization on cosmological scales. These semi-numerical models are efficient in generating large-scale maps of the 21cm signal, but they are too slow to enable inference at the field level. We present different strategies to train a U-Net to accelerate these simulations. We derive the ionization field directly from the initial density field without using the ionizing sources&amp;rsquo; location, and hence emulating the radiative transfer process.</description>

Stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs offer a distinct dynamical channel to produce black hole mergers detected in gravitational waves by LIGO/Virgo. To understand their orbital evolution through interactions with the disc gas, we perform a suite of 2D high-resolution, local shearing box, viscous hydrodynamical simulations of equal-mass binaries. We find that viscosity not only smooths the flow structure around prograde circular binaries, but also greatly raises their accretion rates.</description>

We performed a detailed broadband spectral and timing analysis of a small flaring event of ~120 ks in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 using simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations. The ~300 ks long NuSTAR observation and the overlapping XMM-Newton exposure were segregated into pre-flare, flare, and post-flare segments. During the flare, the NuSTAR count rate peaked at 2.5 times the mean count rate before the flare.</description>

The repeating FRB 20121102A was localized to a star-forming region in a dwarf galaxy and found to be co-located with a persistent radio source (PRS). FRB 20190520B is only the second known source sharing phenomenology akin to FRB 20121102A&amp;rsquo;s, with similar burst activity, host galaxy properties, as well as being associated with a PRS. PRS emission is potentially a calorimeter, allowing us to estimate the energy output of the central FRB engine.</description>

The velocity-integrated $[OIII]$ emission has three peaks which are likely associated with three young stellar clumps of MACS0416_Y1, while the channel map shows a complicated velocity structure with little indication of a global velocity gradient unlike what was found in $[CII]$ 158 $\mu$m at a larger scale, suggesting random bulk motion of ionized gas clouds inside the galaxy.</description>

Using both the recent GOODS-ALMA survey as well as the full suite of ALMA Band-6 ancillary data in the GOODS-S field, we report the tentative detection of dust continuum equivalent of dust mass log($M_{dust}$/$M_{\odot}$) = 7.</description>

Radio activity in AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) produce feedback on the host galaxy via the impact of the relativistic jets on the circumnuclear gas. Although radio jets can reach up to several times the optical radius of the host galaxy, in this review we focus on the observation of the feedback deposited locally in the central region of the host galaxies, in the form of outflows due to the jet-gas interaction.</description>

Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can self-annihilate and thus provide us with the possibility for an indirect detection of Dark Matter (DM). Dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are excellent places to search for annihilation signals because they are rich in DM and background emission is low. If magnetic fields in dSph exist, the particles produced in DM annihilation emit synchrotron radiation. We use the non-detection of 150 MHz radio continuum emission from dSph galaxies with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to derive constraints on the annihilation cross-section of WIMPs into electron-positron pairs.</description>

We study the co-evolution of dark matter halos, galaxies and supermassive black holes using an empirical galaxy evolution model from $z=0$ &amp;ndash; $10$. We demonstrate that by connecting dark matter structure evolution with simple empirical prescriptions for baryonic processes, we are able to faithfully reproduce key observations in the relation between galaxies and their supermassive black holes. By assuming a physically-motivated, direct relationship between the galaxy and supermassive black hole properties to the mass of their host halo, we construct expressions for the galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy UV luminosity function, active black hole mass function and quasar bolometric luminosity function.</description>

The sample consists of 48 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts z=2.7-6.3 which are largely representative of typical star-forming galaxies at these redshifts. The $[SII]$ 6718, 6733 doublet is used to estimate electron densities (n_e), and dust-corrected Ha luminosities are used to compute total ionizing photon rates (Q).</description>

We present new, deep optical observations of the early-type galaxy NGC 4278, which is located in a small loose group. We find that the galaxy lacks fine substructure, i.e., it appears relaxed, out to a radius of $\sim$70 kpc. Our $g$- and $i$-band surface brightness profiles are uniform down to our deepest levels of $\sim$28 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. This spans an extremely large radial range of more than 14 half-mass radii.</description>

We report on the discovery of the companion star to the millisecond pulsar PSR J1835-3259B in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6652. Taking advantage of deep photometric archival observations acquired through the Hubble Space Telescope in near-ultraviolet and optical bands, we identified a bright and blue object at a position compatible with that of the radio pulsar. The companion is located along the helium-core white dwarf cooling sequence and the comparison with binary evolution models provides a mass of $0.</description>

Using observations of MACS0417-z5PSB with a JWST/NIRSpec Prism spectrum and NIRCam imaging, we investigate the mechanism responsible for the cessation of star formation of the galaxy, and speculate about possibilities for its future.</description>

Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are a class of compact, jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) whose jet axes are not aligned close to the line of sight, and whose observed emission is not predominantly relativistically boosted towards us. Using complete samples of CSOs, we present three independent lines of evidence, based on their relative numbers, their redshift distributions, and their size distributions, which show conclusively that most CSOs do not evolve into larger-scale radio sources.</description>

We investigate the mass-metallicity relationship of star forming galaxies by analysing the absorption line spectra of $\sim$200,000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The galaxy spectra are stacked in bins of stellar mass and a population synthesis technique is applied yielding metallicities, ages and star formation history of the young and old stellar population together with interstellar reddening and extinction. We adopt different lengths of the initial starbursts and different initial mass functions for the calculation of model spectra of the single stellar populations contributing to the total integrated spectrum.</description>

The GC ($\sim13.2\pm0.4$ Gyr, $\langle[Fe/H]\rangle = -2.75\pm0.2$ dex) and field (mean age $\sim13.5\pm0.3$ Gyr, $\langle[Fe/H]\rangle = -2.6\pm0.15$ dex) have similar ages and metallicities.</description>

Aims: We provide new insights into the gamma-ray emission from HESS J1912+101, a TeV supernova remnant candidate probably associated with the radio pulsar PSR J1913+1011. Methods: We obtained new observations at 1.5 GHz using the VLA in the D configuration, with the purpose of detecting the radio shell of the putative remnant. In addition, we observed a single pointing at 6.0 GHz toward PSR J1913+1011 to look for a radio pulsar wind nebula.</description>

      <description>First author: Richard J. Parker
The abundance of the short-lived radioisotopes 26-Al and 60-Fe in the early Solar system is usually explained by the Sun either forming from pre-enriched material, or the Sun&amp;rsquo;s protosolar disc being polluted by a nearby supernova explosion from a massive star. Both hypotheses suffer from significant drawbacks: the former does not account for the dynamical evolution of star-forming regions, while in the latter the time for massive stars to explode as supernovae can be similar to, or even longer than, the lifetime of protoplanetary discs.</description>

As well as the galaxy number density and peculiar velocity, the galaxy intrinsic alignment can be used to test the cosmic isotropy. We study distinctive impacts of the isotropy breaking on the configuration-space two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) composed of the spin-2 galaxy ellipticity field. For this purpose, we build a methodology to efficiently compute general types of the isotropy-violating 2PCFs by generalizing the polypolar spherical harmonic decomposition approach to the spin-weighted version.</description>

We investigate the link between the bar rotation rate and dark matter content in barred galaxies by concentrating on the cases of the lenticular galaxies NGC4264 and NGC4277. These two gas-poor galaxies have similar morphologies, sizes, and luminosities. But, NGC4264 hosts a fast bar, which extends to nearly the corotation, while the bar embedded in NGC4277 is slow and falls short of corotation. We derive the fraction of dark matter $f_{\rm DM, bar}$ within the bar region from Jeans axisymmetric dynamical models by matching the stellar kinematics obtained with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph and using SDSS images to recover the stellar mass distribution.</description>

According to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, present-day massive galaxies should contain a sizable fraction of dark matter within their stellar body. Models indicate that in massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) with $M_\star\approx1.5\times10^{11},{\rm M}\odot$ dark matter should account for $\sim60%$ of the dynamical mass within five effective radii ($5,R{\rm e}$). Most massive ETGs have been shaped through a two-phase process: the rapid growth of a compact core was followed by the accretion of an extended envelope through mergers.</description>

Lorentz invariance is one of the fundamental tenets of Special Relativity, and has been extensively tested with laboratory and astrophysical observations. However, many quantum gravity models and theories beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics predict a violation of Lorentz invariance at energies close to Planck scale. This article reviews observational and experimental tests of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) with photons, neutrinos and gravitational waves. Most astrophysical tests of LIV using photons are based on searching for a correlation of the spectral lag data with redshift and energy.</description>

The {\it Linear Point} (LP), defined as the midpoint between the BAO peak and the associated left dip of the two-point correlation function (2PCF), $\xi(s)$, is proposed as a new standard ruler which is insensitive to nonlinear effects. In this paper, we use a Bayesian sampler to measure the LP and estimate the corresponding statistical uncertainty, and then perform cosmological parameter constraints with LP measurements. Using the Patchy mock catalogues, we find that the measured LPs are consistent with theoretical predictions at 0.</description>

Third-generation (3G) gravitational wave detectors, in particular Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), will explore unprecedented cosmic volumes in search for compact binary mergers, providing us with tens of thousands of detections per year. In this study, we simulate and employ binary black holes detected by 3G interferometers as dark sirens, to extract and infer cosmological parameters by cross-matching gravitational wave data with electromagnetic information retrieved from a simulated galaxy catalog.</description>

Studying open clusters (OCs) is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. Many previous studies have systematically searched for OCs near the solar system within 1.2 kpc or 20 degrees of galactic latitude. However, few studies searched for OCs at higher galactic latitudes and deeper distances. In this study, based on a hybrid unsupervised clustering algorithm (Friends-of-Friends and pyUPMASK) and a binary classification algorithm (Random Forest), we extended the search region (i.</description>

With the aim of improving our knowledge about their nature, we conduct a comparative study on a sample of long-rising Type II supernovae (SNe) resembling SN 1987A. To do so, we deduce various scaling relations from different analytic models of H-rich SNe, discussing their robustness and feasibility. Then we use the best relations in terms of accuracy to infer the SN progenitor&amp;rsquo;s physical properties at the explosion for the selected sample of SN 1987A-like objects, deriving energies of $\sim 0.</description>

We use $z=1$ mock galaxy catalogues produced with the semi-analytic code GALACTICUS to study the dependence of the non-Gaussian bias parameter $b_\phi$ on the mass assembly history of the host halos. We generate large sets of merger trees and measure the non-Gaussian assembly bias $\Delta b_\phi$ for galaxies selected by color magnitude and emission line luminosities. For galaxies selected by $g-r$ color, we find a large assembly bias consistent with the analysis of Barreira et al.</description>

Broadband photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) have been investigated for AGNs in recent years, but mostly on accretion disk continuum RM. Due to the small fraction of broad emission lines in the broadband, PRM for emission lines is very challenging. Here we present an ICCF-Cut method for broadband PRM to obtain the H$\alpha$ broad line lag and apply it to four Seyfert 1 galaxies, MCG+08-11-011, NGC 2617, 3C 120 and NGC 5548.</description>

Supermassive stars are Population III stars with masses exceeding $10^4,M_{\odot}$ that could be the progenitors of the first supermassive black holes. Their interiors are in a regime where radiation pressure dominates the equation of state. In this work, we use the explicit gas dynamics code PPMstar to simulate the hydrogen-burning core of a $10^4,M_{\odot}$ supermassive main-sequence star. These are the first 3D hydrodynamics simulations of core convection in supermassive stars.</description>

Context: To study the effects of environment on galaxies we use HI observations of galaxies in and around the cluster A2626. The cluster can effectively be divided in three different environments: the cluster itself, a group environment in the periphery of the cluster (we call it the Swarm) and substructure in the cluster itself. We use these to study the dependence of galaxy properties on environment.</description>

Cosmology inference of galaxy clustering at the field level with the EFT likelihood in principle allows for extracting all non-Gaussian information from quasi-linear scales, while robustly marginalizing over any astrophysical uncertainties. A pipeline in this spirit is implemented in the \texttt{LEFTfield} code, which we extend in this work to describe the clustering of galaxies in redshift space. Our main additions are: the computation of the velocity field in the LPT gravity model, the fully nonlinear displacement of the evolved, biased density field to redshift space, and a systematic expansion of velocity bias.</description>

We present the discovery of the most distant, dynamically relaxed cool core cluster, SPT-CL J2215-3537 (SPT2215) and its central brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) at z=1.16. Using new X-ray observations, we demonstrate that SPT2215 harbors a strong cool core, with a central cooling time of 200 Myr (at 10 kpc) and a maximal intracluster medium cooling rate of 1900+/-400 Msun/yr. This prodigious cooling may be responsible for fueling extended, star-forming filaments observed in Hubble Space Telescope imaging.</description>

Distant protoclusters of galaxies, as the progenitors of massive galaxy clusters in the present day, are expected to host brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) at their early formation stage. It remains unclear whether the assembly of (some) BCGs is essential to the formation of a mature cluster core or vice versa. Here we report the detection of a pair of massive quiescent galaxies likely in the process of merging at the centre of the spectroscopically confirmed, extremely massive protocluster BOSS1244 at a look-back time of 10.</description>

Apart from the well-known flat $\Lambda$CDM model as well as other models that have been broadly studied, this project includes two new models, which are the $\textit{o}\textit{w}$CDM model and the $\textit{o}\textit{w}0\textit{w}a$CDM model, to fully evaluate the correlations between the cosmological parameters by performing the MCMC algorithm and to explore the geometry and mass content of the Universe.</description>

The transformation and evolution of a galaxy is strongly influenced by interactions with its environment. Neutral hydrogen (\HI) is an excellent way to trace these interactions. Here, we present \HI\ observations of the spiral galaxy NGC~895, which was previously thought to be isolated. High-sensitivity \HI\ observations from the MeerKAT large survey project MIGHTEE reveal possible interaction features, such as extended spiral arms, and the two newly discovered \HI\ companions, that drive us to change the narrative that it is an isolated galaxy.</description>

At the highest stellar masses (log(\mstar) $\gtrsim$ 11.5 \msun), only a small fraction of galaxies are disk-like and actively star-forming objects.

We present new CO(1-0) data for a sample of 46 super spirals and for 18 slightly lower-mass (log(\mstar) $&amp;gt;$ 11.</description>

The innermost ejecta of core-collapse supernovae are considered to be the sources of some iron-group and heavier nuclei. The ejecta are predominantly driven by neutrino heating, principally due to neutrino capture on free neutrons and protons. Such neutrino interaction plays a crucial role for setting neutron richness in the ejecta. Recent hydrodynamics work with sophisticated neutrino transport indicates that the ejecta are only mildly neutron rich or even proton rich.</description>

In this work we propose that the formation of some $\sim 50~M_\odot$ primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early Universe via super-Eddington accretion within the dark matter halo can explain these observations.</description>

High-resolution X-ray observations offer a unique tool for probing the still elusive connection between galaxy mergers and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We present an analysis of nuclear X-ray emission in an optically selected sample of 92 close galaxy pairs (with projected separations $\lesssim 20$ kpc and line-of-sight velocity offsets $&amp;lt;$ 500 km s$^{-1}$) at low redshift ($\bar{z} \sim 0.07$), based on archival Chandra observations. The parent sample of galaxy pairs is constructed without imposing an optical classification of nuclear activity, thus is largely free of selection effect for or against the presence of an AGN.</description>

The galaxy group NGC6338 is one of the most violent group-group mergers known to date. While the central dominant galaxies rush at each other at 1400km/s along the line of sight, with dramatic gas heating and shock fronts detected, the central gas in the BCGs remains cool. There are also indications of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and neither subcluster core has been disrupted. With our deep radio uGMRT data at 383MHz and 650MHz we clearly detect a set of large, old lobes in the southern BCG coinciding with the X-ray cavities, while the northern, and smaller BCG appears slightly extended in the radio.</description>

However, direct evidence for quasar feedback in action at the epoch of peak black hole accretion at z ~ 2 remains elusive. A good case in point is the z = 1.6 quasar WISEA J100211.29+013706.7 (XID 2028) where past analyses of the same ground-based data have come to different conclusions.</description>

      <description>First author: L. Hern√°ndez-Garc√≠a
PBC J2333.9-2343 is a giant radio galaxy at z = 0.047 with a bright central core associated to a blazar nucleus. If the nuclear blazar jet is a new phase of the jet activity, then the small orientation angle suggest a dramatic change of the jet direction. We present observations obtained between September 2018 and January 2019 (cadence larger than three days) with Effeslberg, SMARTS-1.3m, ZTF, ATLAS, Swift, and Fermi-LAT, and between April-July 2019 (daily cadence) with SMARTS-1.</description>

      <description>First author: Dhruba Dutta Chowdhury
Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), consisting of ultralight bosons, is an intriguing alternative to Cold Dark Matter. Numerical simulations solving the Schr&amp;quot;odinger-Poisson (SP) equation, which governs FDM dynamics, show that FDM halos consist of a central solitonic core (representing the ground state of the SP equation), surrounded by a large envelope of excited states. Wave interference gives rise to order unity density fluctuations throughout the envelope and causes the soliton to undergo density oscillations and execute a confined random walk in the central region of the halo.</description>

The short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) have a half-life $\leq$ 100 Myr. The $\gamma$-ray observations and excess abundance of their daughter nuclides in various meteoritic phases confirm the existence of SLRs in the Galaxy and early solar system (ESS), respectively. In this work, we have developed Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models for SLRs, $^{26}$Al, and $^{60}$Fe along with $^{36}$Cl, $^{41}$Ca, and $^{53}$Mn. These models predict the temporal and spatial evolution of SLR abundance trends in the Galaxy from 2-18 kpc.</description>

We present a one-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic model of a spherically symmetric cloud evolving under the influence of the self-gravity and the feedback from a star cluster forming in its centre. On one hand, the model is simple due to its 1D geometry, on the other hand, the feedback includes the ionising radiation, stellar winds and the radiation pressure acting on gas and dust. The star cluster is formed from the gas flowing into the cloud centre and the feedback parameters are determined from stellar evolution models and the cluster star forming history.</description>

In order to probe modifications of gravity at cosmological scales, one needs accurate theoretical predictions. N-body simulations are required to explore the non-linear regime of structure formation but are very time consuming. In this work, we build an emulator, dubbed e-MANTIS, that performs an accurate and fast interpolation between the predictions of a given set of cosmological simulations, in $f(R)$ modified gravity, run with ECOSMOG. We sample a wide 3D parameter space given by the current background scalar field value $10^{-7} &amp;lt; \left|f_{R_0} \right| &amp;lt; 10^{-4}$, matter density $0.</description>

We present a pedagogical review of the halo model, a flexible framework that can describe the distribution of matter and its tracers on non-linear scales for both conventional and exotic cosmological models. We start with the premise that the complex structure of the cosmic web can be described by the sum of its individual components: dark matter, gas, and galaxies, all distributed within spherical haloes with a range of masses.</description>

Low-ionization Broad Absorption Line QSOs (LoBALs) are suspected to be merging systems in which extreme, AGN-driven outflows have been triggered. Whether or not LoBALs are uniquely associated with mergers, however, has yet to be established. To characterize the morphologies of LoBALs, we present the first high-resolution morphological analysis of a volume-limited sample of 22 SDSS-selected LoBALs at 0.5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.6 from Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 observations.</description>

The conditions under which accreting neutron stars launch radio-emitting jets and/or outflows are still poorly understood. The ultracompact X-ray binary X1850--087, located in the globular cluster NGC 6712, is a persistent atoll-type X-ray source that has previously shown unusual radio continuum variability. Here we present the results of a pilot radio monitoring program of X1850--087 undertaken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, with simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous Swift/XRT data obtained at each epoch.</description>

We present optical photometric and spectroscopic studies of three supernovae (SNe) SN 2013bz, PSN J0910+5003 and ASASSN-16ex. UV-optical photometric data of ASASSN-16ex obtained with Swift-UVOT are also analyzed. These objects were initially classified as 09dc-like type Ia SNe. The decline rate parameters ($\Delta m_{15}(B){true}$) are derived as 0.92 $\pm$ 0.04 (SN 2013bz), 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05 (PSN J0910+5003) and 0.73 $\pm$ 0.03 (ASASSN-16ex).

There is no source for cosmic vorticity within the cold dark matter cosmology. However, vorticity has been observed in the universe, especially on the scales of clusters, filaments, galaxies, etc. Recent results from high-resolution general relativistic N-body simulation show that the vorticity power spectrum dominates over the power spectrum of the divergence of the peculiar velocity field on scales where the effective field theory of large-scale structure breaks down.</description>

The bulk of X-ray spectroscopic studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are focused on local ($z &amp;lt; 0.1$) sources with low-to-moderate ($&amp;lt; 0.3$) Eddington ratio ($\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$). It is then mandatory to overcome this limitation and improve our understanding of highly accreting AGN. In this work we present the preliminary results from the analysis of a sample of $\sim70$ high-$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ radio-quiet AGN at $0.06 \leq z \leq 3.</description>

Following the matching of beam sizes to 1-2 kpc for each (U)LIRG, the high-J to low-J transition-line flux ratios of each molecule and the emission line flux ratios of different molecules at each J transition are derived.</description>

We use the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science NIRCam parallel observations to provide a first view of the UV continuum properties of NIRCam/F444W selected galaxies at 4&amp;amp;lt;z&amp;amp;lt;7. By combining multiwavelength NIRCam observations, we constrain the UV continuum slope for a sample of 401 galaxies with stringent quality controls. We find that &amp;amp;gt;99% of the galaxies are blue star-forming galaxies with very low levels of dust (Avbeta~0.01+/-0.33). We find no statistically significant correlation for UV slope with redshift or UV magnitude.</description>

Extracting the CMB blackbody temperature power spectrum &amp;ndash; which is dominated by the primary CMB signal and the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich (kSZ) effect &amp;ndash; from mm-wave sky maps requires cleaning other sky components. In this work, we develop new methods to use large-scale structure (LSS) tracers to remove cosmic infrared background (CIB) and thermal Sunyaev-Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich (tSZ) contamination in such measurements. Our methods rely on the fact that LSS tracers are correlated with the CIB and tSZ signals, but their two-point correlations with the CMB and kSZ signals vanish on small scales, thus leaving the CMB blackbody power spectrum unbiased after cleaning.</description>

Unusually high N/O abundances were recently reported for a very compact, intensively star-forming object GN-z11 at z=10.6 from JWST/NIRSpec observations. We present an empirical comparison with the C, N, and O abundance ratios in Galactic globular clusters (GCs) over a large metallicity range. We show that hot hydrogen-burning nucleosynthesis within supermassive stars (SMS) formed through runaway collisions can consistently explain the observed abundances ratio in GN-z11 and in GCs.</description>

We report a $z=2.30$ galaxy protocluster (COSTCO-I) in the COSMOS field, where the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as seen in the CLAMATO IGM tomography survey does not show significant absorption. This departs from the transmission-density relationship (often dubbed the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation; FGPA) usually expected to hold at this epoch, which would lead one to predict strong Ly$\alpha$ absorption at the overdensity. For comparison, we generate mock Lyman-$\alpha$ forest maps by applying FGPA to constrained simulations of the COSMOS density field, and create mocks that incorporate the effects of finite sightline sampling, pixel noise, and Wiener filtering.</description>

Spectral modeling of SN 2021ckj reveals that its composition is dominated by oxygen, carbon and iron group elements, and the photospheric velocity at peak is ~10000 km/s. From the light curve (LC) modeling applied to SNe 2021ckj, 2019hgp, and 2021csp, we find that the ejecta and CSM properties of Type Icn SNe are diverse.</description>

A joint hadronic model is shown to quantitatively explain the observations of diffuse radio emission from galaxy clusters in the form of minihalos, giant halos, relics, and their hybrid, transitional stages. Cosmic-ray diffusion of order $D\sim 10^{31\text{&amp;ndash;}32}\text{ cm}^2\text{ s}^{-1}$, inferred independently from relic energies, the spatial variability of giant-halo spectra, and the spectral evolution of relics, reproduces the observed spatio-spectral distributions, explains the recently discovered mega-halos as enhanced peripheral magnetisation, and quenches electron (re)acceleration by weak shocks or turbulence.</description>

Supermassive stars (SMS) with masses $M \gtrsim 10^3-10^4 M_{\odot}$, formed by runaway collisions in young, massive, and dense star clusters have been invoked as a possible solution to the puzzles raised by the presence of multiple stellar populations and peculiar abundance patterns observed in globular clusters. However, such objects have not been observed so far. We developed observational strategies to search for SMS hosted within young massive clusters (thought to be the precursors of globular clusters, GCs), which could be applicable in a relatively general fashion, using both photometric and spectroscopic observations.</description>

Compact objects (COs) can exist and evolve in an active galactic nuclei (AGN) disk, triggering a series of attractive CO-related multi-messenger events around a supermassive black hole. To better understand the nature of an embedded CO and its surroundings and to investigate CO-related events more accurately, in this paper, we study the specific accretion process of a CO in an AGN disk and explore the role of outflow feedback.</description>

      <description>First author: Haowen Zhang
Using recent empirical constraints on the dark matter halo&amp;ndash;galaxy&amp;ndash;supermassive black hole (SMBH) connection from $z=0-7$, we infer how undermassive, typical, and overmassive SMBHs contribute to the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at $z=6$. We find that beyond $L_\mathrm{bol} = 5 \times 10^{46}$ erg/s, the $z=6$ QLF is dominated by SMBHs that are at least 0.3 dex above the $z=6$ median $M_\bullet-M_$ relation. The QLF is dominated by typical SMBHs (i.</description>

      <description>First author: Adam B. Watts
The quenching of cluster satellite galaxies is inextricably linked to the suppression of their cold interstellar medium (ISM) by environmental mechanisms. While the removal of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) at large radii is well studied, how the environment impacts the remaining gas in the centres of galaxies, which are dominated by molecular gas, is less clear. Using new observations from the Virgo Environment traced in CO survey (VERTICO) and archival HI data, we study the HI and molecular gas within the optical discs of Virgo cluster galaxies on 1.</description>

      <description>First author: Shahnawaz A. Adil
Hubble constant $H_0$ and weighted amplitude of matter fluctuations $S_8$ determinations are biased to higher and lower values, respectively, in the late Universe with respect to early Universe values inferred by the Planck collaboration within flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. If these anomalies are physical, i.e. not due to systematics, they naively suggest that $H_0$ decreases and $S_8$ increases with effective redshift. Here, on the assumption that matter density parameter today $\Omega_{m}$ is a constant, we show that $S_8$ determinations from $f \sigma_8(z)$ constraints increase with effective redshift, thereby providing corroborating support for an $S_8$ discrepancy that is physical in origin.</description>

We present the first 3D hydrodynamics simulations of the excitation and propagation of internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the radiative interiors of low-mass stars on the red giant branch (RGB). We use the PPMstar explicit gas dynamics code to simulate a portion of the convective envelope and all the radiative zone down to the hydrogen-burning shell of a 1.2$M_{\odot}$ upper RGB star. We perform simulations for different grid resolutions (768$^3$, 1536$^3$ and 2880$^3$), a range of driving luminosities, and two different stratifications (corresponding to the bump luminosity and the tip of the RGB).</description>

With tantalizing evidence of the recent e-Rosita mission, re-discovering very soft X-rays and EUV radiation from a cluster of galaxies or its environment, the question of the origin of cluster EUV excess is revisited in this work. It will be shown that the gas temperature, density, and frozen-in magnetic field of the intracluster medium, collectively support the emission and propagation of coherent \u{C}erenkov radiation, which is low frequency and large amplitude radiation capable of accelerating charged particles to relativistic speeds.</description>

The fraction of ionizing photons that escape their host galaxies to ionize hydrogen in the inter-galactic medium (IGM) is a critical parameter in analyses of the reionization era. In this paper we use the Meraxes semi-analytic galaxy formation model to infer the mean ionizing photon escape fraction and its dependence on galaxy properties through joint modelling of the observed high redshift galaxy population and existing constraints on the reionization history.</description>

Eccentric mergers are a signature of the dynamical formation channel of binary black holes (BBHs) in dense stellar environments and hierarchical triple systems. Here, we investigate the production of eccentric mergers via binary-single interactions, by means of $2.5\times10^{5}$ direct $\textit{N}$-body simulations. Our simulations include post-Newtonian terms up to the 2.5th order and are designed to reflect the environmental conditions of young (YSCs), globular (GCs), and nuclear star clusters (NSCs).</description>

      <description>Hongwan Liu,
Decaying or annihilating dark matter and other exotic energy injections can modify the spectrum of the universe&amp;amp;#39;s photon bath, resulting in e.g. new contributions to spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background blackbody spectrum and modifications to the temperature and ionization history of the universe. Here, we present an improved version of the $\texttt{DarkHistory}$ code, which is now capable of consistently calculating the spectrum of low-energy photons by properly treating the interactions of these photons with the levels of hydrogen atoms.</description>

We calculate the post-recombination contribution to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion due to general exotic energy injections, including dark matter (DM) decaying or annihilating to Standard Model particles. Upon subtracting the background distortion that would be present even without such energy injections, we find residual distortions that are still potentially large enough to be detectable by future experiments such as PIXIE. The distortions also have a high-energy spectral feature that is a unique signature of the injection of high-energy particles.</description>

We investigate the first emergence of the so-called cold accretion, the accretion flows deeply penetrating a halo, in the early universe with cosmological N-body/SPH simulations. We study the structure of the accretion flow and its evolution within small halos with $\lesssim 10^8~{\rm M}_\odot$ with sufficiently high spatial resolutions down to $\sim 1 \ {\rm pc}$ scale. While previous studies only follow the evolution for a short period after the primordial cloud collapse, we follow the long-term evolution until the cold accretion first appears, employing the sink particle method.</description>

The recent $\sim 4 , \sigma$ Hubble constant, $H_{0}$, tension is observed between the value of $H_{0}$ from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia). It is a decade since this tension is excruciating the modern astrophysical community. To shed light on this problem is key to consider probes at intermediate redshifts between SNe Ia and CMB and reduce the uncertainty on $H_0$.</description>

We use JWST NIRCam observations from 1.5 to 4.44 micron of the massive lensing cluster field A2744 to show that extreme red selected galaxies (f(F444W) &amp;gt; 1 uJy and f(F444W)/f(F150W) &amp;gt; 3.5) pick out all 9 &amp;gt;4.5-sigma ALMA 1.1 or 1.2 mm sources and 17 of the 19 &amp;gt;5-sigma SCUBA-2 850 micron sources in the covered areas. Next, we use the red selected galaxies as priors to probe deeper in the SCUBA-2 850 micron image, identifying a sample of 44 &amp;gt;3-sigma SCUBA-2 850 micron sources with accurate positions, photometric redshifts, and magnifications.</description>

We employ a machine learning (ML) algorithm to analyze cosmological background data and the linear red-shift space distortion (RSD) data in a model-independent way, with specific focus on the Hubble expansion rate and the growth of large-scale structure. We find strong evidence that the natural enhancement in the Hubble parameter at low redshifts is due to the underlying phantom nature of dark energy, rather than low matter density.</description>

We select ~3,500 SFGs that have both LOFAR 150MHz and GMRT 610MHz detections by removing AGN from the two radio samples, and obtain a median spectral index of $\alpha_{150}^{610}=-0.51\pm0.01$ with a scatter of $\sigma=0.</description>

In this letter, we explore the quiescent lives of central galaxies using the SAGE galaxy model and Uchuu dark matter simulation.

(3) What is the typical duration of a quiescent phase? We find low and high-mass galaxies spend the highest fraction of their lives in quiescence: 45 \pm 19% for log10(Mstar) &amp;lt; 9.</description>

These empirically relations were derived for the first time in the gri filters except for the g-band PL relation.</description>

We study varying forms of viscous dark matter and try to address the intriguing tensions of the standard model of cosmology with the recent cosmological data, including the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions. We note that assuming the dark matter viscosity depends on the Hubble parameter, dark matter density, or both, one can improve the statistics. Although the models tend to aggravate the Hubble tension a bit, they tend to reduce the $S_8$ tension, even in comparison with the constant viscosity case.</description>

This work generalizes the discrete implicit Monte-Carlo (DIMC) method for modeling the radiative transfer equation from a gray treatment to an frequency-dependent one. The classic implicit Monte-Carlo (IMC) algorithm, that has been used for several decades, suffers from a well-known numerical problem, called teleportation, where the photons might propagate faster than the exact solution due to the finite size of the spatial and temporal resolution. The Semi-analog Monte-Carlo algorithm proposed the use of two kinds of particles, photons and material particles that are born when a photon is absorbed.</description>

      <description>Chen Zhang
It is intriguing to ask whether the existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe could significantly reduce the abundance of certain stable massive particles (SMP) via gravitational capture, after which the PBHs evaporate before BBN to avoid conflict with stringent bounds. For example, this mechanism is relevant to an alternative solution of the monopole problem proposed by Stojkovic and Freese, in which magnetic monopoles produced in the early universe are captured by PBHs, thus freeing inflation from having to occur during or after the corresponding phase transitions that produced the monopoles.</description>

      <description>First author: Maria Emilia De Rossi
By implementing a model of primordial dust emission, we predict dust-continuum fluxes for massive galaxy sources similar to those recently detected by JWST at $z \gtrsim 7$. Current upper flux limits, obtained with ALMA for some of these sources, can constrain gas metallicity and dust fraction of the first galaxies. Encouragingly, if assuming expected properties for typical first galaxies (i.e., dust-to-metal mass ratio: $D/M = 5 \times 10^{-3}$, gas metallicity: $Z_{\rm g} = 5 \times 10^{-3}~Z_{\odot}$, star formation efficiency: $\eta = 0.</description>

Minkowski&amp;rsquo;s Object and &amp;lsquo;Death Star galaxy&amp;rsquo; are two of the famous cases of rare instances when a radio jet has been observed to directly hit a neighbouring galaxy. RAD12, the RAD@home citizen science discovery with GMRT being presented here, is not only a new system being added to nearly half a dozen rare cases known so far but also the first case where the neighbouring galaxy is not a minor or dwarf companion but a galaxy bigger than the host of the radio jet.</description>

We present six epochs of optical spectropolarimetry of the Type IIP supernova (SN) 2021yja ranging from $\sim$ 25 to 95 days after the explosion. An unusually high continuum linear polarization of $p \sim 0.9%$ is measured during the early photospheric phase, followed by a steady decrease well before the onset of the nebular phase. This behavior has not been observed before in Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP).</description>

Recent photometric observations of massive stars have identified a low-frequency power excess which appears as stochastic low-frequency variability in light curve observations. We present the oscillation properties of high resolution hydrodynamic simulations of a 25 $\mathrm{M}\odot$ star performed with the PPMStar code. The model star has a convective core mass of $\approx, 12, \mathrm{M}\odot$ and approximately half of the envelope simulated. From this simulation, we extract light curves from several directions, average them over each hemisphere, and process them as if they were real photometric observations.</description>

Ongoing MeV telescopes such as INTEGRAL/SPI and Fermi/GBM, and proposed telescopes including the recently accepted COSI and the e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO missions, provide another window in understanding transients. Their signals contain information about the stellar explosion mechanisms and their corresponding nucleosynthesis of short-lived radioactive isotopes. This raises the need of a radiative transfer code which may efficiently explore different types of astrophysical $Œ≥$-ray sources and their dependence on model parameters and input physics.</description>

We fit a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model as well as various extensions including a constant dark energy equation of state not equal to $-1$, a time-varying dark energy equation of state, and these same models allowing for spatial curvature.</description>

Images of 10 galaxies in F814W and F606W filters obtained on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) are used to construct color-magnitude diagrams for the star population of these galaxies. The distances to the galaxies are estimated from the luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch. The galaxies examined here have radial velocities from 250 to 760 km/s relative to the centroid of the Local Group and distances ranging from 3.</description>

Context. Recent observations of GRB 200415A, a short and very bright pulse of $\gamma$-rays, have been claimed to be an extragalactic magnetar giant flare (MGF) whose proposed host galaxy is the nearby ${\mathrm{NGC} , 253}$. However, as the redshift of the transient object was not measured, it is possible that the measured location of the transient on the celestial sphere and the location of the local galaxy merely coincided.</description>

      <description>First author: Bartolomeo Fiorini
One of the main objectives of stage IV galaxy surveys is to constrain gravity on cosmological scales. To this end, it is crucial to make accurate theoretical predictions in the nonlinear regime of structure formation in order to maximise the scientific return. This is possible at a relatively low computational cost thanks to COLA simulations, an approximate and much faster alternative to full $N$-body simulations. In this thesis, we focus on two modified gravity theories, $f(R)$ and nDGP, and present an analysis of how COLA simulations can be combined with empirical models for the galaxy-halo connection to produce realistic mock galaxy catalogues in modified gravity.</description>

We present a spectro-photometric study of a mass-complete sample of quiescent galaxies at $1.0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 1.3$ with $\mathrm{log_{10}}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}) \geq 10.3$ drawn from the VANDELS survey, exploring the relationship between stellar mass, age and star-formation history. Within our sample of 114 galaxies, we derive a stellar-mass vs stellar-age relation with a slope of $1.20^{+0.28}{-0.27}$ Gyr per decade in stellar mass. When combined with recent literature results, we find evidence that the slope of this relation remains consistent over the redshift interval $0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4$.</description>

      <description>First author: Zhongxu Zhai
The source of the tension between local SN Ia based Hubble constant measurements and those from the CMB or BAO+BBN measurements is one of the most interesting unknowns of modern cosmology. Sample variance forms a key component of the error on the local measurements, and will dominate the error budget in the future as more supernovae are observed. Many methods have been proposed to estimate sample variance in many contexts, and we compared results from a number of them in Zhai &amp;amp; Percival (2022), confirming that sample variance for the Pantheon supernovae sample does not solve the Hubble tension.</description>

Mass and angular momentum are key parameters of galaxies.

In this work, we measure j* in a sample of 32 early type galaxies (ETGs) from the ePN.S survey, using full 2D kinematic information out to a mean 6Re. We present lambda and j* profiles.</description>

Massive neutrinos and $f(R)$ modified gravity have degenerate observational signatures that can impact the interpretation of results in galaxy survey experiments, such as cosmological parameter estimations and gravity model tests. Because of this, it is important to investigate astrophysical observables that can break these degeneracies. Cosmic voids are sensitive to both massive neutrinos and modifications of gravity and provide a promising ground for disentangling the above mentioned degeneracies.</description>

We performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the inner $\approx 50%$ radial extent of a $25\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$ star in the early phase of the main sequence and investigate core convection and internal gravity waves in the core-envelope boundary region. Simulations for different grid resolutions and driving luminosities establish scaling relations to constrain models of mixing for 1D applications. As in previous works, the turbulent mass entrainment rate extrapolated to nominal heating is unrealistically high ($1.</description>

Based on the Tinker spectroscopic catalogue of haloes and galaxies, we extract 87 FG and 100 non-FG candidates.</description>

Neutrinos propagating in a dense neutrino gas, such as those expected in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs), can experience fast flavor conversions on relatively short scales. This can happen if the neutrino electron lepton number ($\nu$ELN) angular distribution crosses zero in a certain direction. Despite this, most of the state-of-the-art CCSN and NSM simulations do not provide such detailed angular information and instead, supply only a few moments of the neutrino angular distributions.</description>

Gradients in the mass-to-light ratio of distant galaxies impede our ability to characterize their size and compactness. The long-wavelength filters of $JWST$&amp;rsquo;s NIRCam offer a significant step forward. For galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim2$), this regime corresponds to the rest-frame near-infrared, which is less biased towards young stars and captures emission from the bulk of a galaxy&amp;rsquo;s stellar population. We present an initial analysis of an extraordinary lensed dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at $z=2.</description>

The jets account for the highly non-spherical morphology of W49B and the thermonuclear outburst to its high iron abundance.</description>

We present the first analysis of cosmic shear measured in DES Y3 that employs the entire range of angular scales in the data. To achieve this, we build upon recent advances in the theoretical modelling of weak lensing provided by a combination of $N$-body simulations, physical models of baryonic processes, and neural networks. Specifically, we use BACCOemu to model the linear and nonlinear matter power spectrum including baryonic physics, allowing us to robustly exploit scales smaller than those used by the DES Collaboration.</description>

In recent years, large radio surveys of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), comprising millions of sources, have become available where one could investigate dipole asymmetries, assumedly arising due to a peculiar motion of the Solar system. Investigations of such dipoles have yielded in past much larger amplitudes (a factor of 2 to 20) than that of the CMB dipole, though their inferred directions in sky seem to lie, within statistical uncertainties, close to the CMB dipole.</description>

      <description>First author: Julius Wons
We forecast the ability of bispectrum estimators to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity using future photometric galaxy redshift surveys. A full-sky survey with photometric redshift resolution of $\sigma_z/(1+z)=0.05$ in the redshift range $0.2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;2$ can provide constraints $\sigma(f^\mathrm{local}\mathrm{NL})=3.4$, $\sigma(f^\mathrm{equil}\mathrm{NL})=15$, and $\sigma(f^\mathrm{orth}_\mathrm{NL})=17$ for the local, equilateral, and orthogonal shapes respectively, delivering constraints on primordial non-Gaussianities competitive to those from the cosmic microwave background. We generalize these results by deriving a scaling relation for the constraints on the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity as a function of redshift error, depth, sky coverage, and nonlinear scale cutoff.</description>

      <description>First author: Francesco D&amp;rsquo;Eugenio
We present the first study of spatially integrated higher-order stellar kinematics over cosmic time. We use deep rest-frame optical spectroscopy of quiescent galaxies at redshifts z=0.05, 0.3 and 0.8 from the SAMI, MAGPI and LEGA-C surveys to measure the excess kurtosis $h_4$ of the stellar velocity distribution, the latter parametrised as a Gauss-Hermite series. Conservatively using a redshift-independent cut in stellar mass ($M_\star = 10^{11},{\rm M}_\odot$), and matching the stellar-mass distributions of our samples, we find 7 $\sigma$ evidence of $h_4$ increasing with cosmic time, from a median value of 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Roman Tkachenko
We numerically study the origin of the multi-armed spiral structure observed in the circumnuclear gaseous mini-disks of nearby galaxies. We show that the presence of dust in such disks and its interaction with the gravitationally stable gaseous component leads to the development of a multi-armed spiral structure. As a particular example, we study the formation of the multi-armed spiral pattern in the mini-disk of the galaxy NGC 4736, for which the observational data for the rotation and the density distribution are available.</description>

Recent high-$z$ quasar observations strongly indicate that super-Eddington accretion is a crucial phase to describe the existence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with $M_\mathrm{BH} \gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at $z \gtrsim 7$. Motivated by the theoretical suggestion that the super-Eddington phase efficiently produces outflows and jets bright in radio bands, we search and find a super-Eddington radio-loud dust-obscured galaxy (DOG) J1406+0102 at $z=0.236$, through cross-matching of the infrared-bright DOGs of Noboriguchi et al.</description>

      <description>Damien Korber
With the advent of the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), scientists will be able to directly observe the Epoch of Reionization by mapping the distribution of neutral hydrogen at different redshifts. While physically motivated results can be simulated with radiative transfer codes, these simulations are computationally expensive and can not readily produce the required scale and resolution simultaneously. Here we introduce the Physics-Informed neural Network for reIONization (PINION), which can accurately and swiftly predict the complete 4-D hydrogen fraction evolution from the smoothed gas and mass density fields from pre-computed N-body simulation.</description>

A variety of observational campaigns seek to test dark-matter models by measuring dark-matter subhaloes at low masses. Despite their predicted lack of stars, these subhaloes may be detectable through gravitational lensing or via their gravitational perturbations on stellar streams. To set measurable expectations for subhalo populations within LambdaCDM, we examine 11 Milky Way (MW)-mass haloes from the FIRE-2 baryonic simulations, quantifying the counts and orbital fluxes for subhaloes with properties relevant to stellar stream interactions: masses down to 10^6 Msun, distances &amp;lt; 50 kpc of the galactic center, across z = 0 - 1 (lookback time 0 - 8 Gyr).</description>

      <description>First author: Gu Lim
The progenitor system of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is expected to be a close binary system of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf (WD) and a non-degenerate star or another WD. Here, we present results from a high-cadence monitoring observation of SN 2021hpr in a spiral galaxy, NGC 3147, and constraints on the progenitor system based on its early multi-color light curve data. First, we classify SN 2021hpr as a normal SN Ia from its long-term photometric and spectroscopic data.</description>

We make use of recent estimates for the parameters of the Milky Way&amp;amp;#39;s halo globular clusters and study the influence of the galactic bar on the dynamics of these clusters by computing their orbits. We use both an axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric galactic potentials, which include the rotating elongated bar/bulge structure. We account for observational errors both in the positions and in the velocities of the globular clusters and explore the influence of the bar on cluster&amp;amp;#39;s evolution.</description>

      <description>First author: J. Bland-Hawthorn
Recent observations of high-redshift galactic disks ($z\approx 1-3$) show a strong negative trend in the dark matter fraction $f_{DM}$ with increasing baryonic surface density. For this to be true, the inner baryons must dominate over dark matter in early massive galaxies, as observed in the Milky Way today. If disks are dominant at early times, we show that stellar bars form promptly within these disks, leading to a high bar fraction at early times.</description>

      <description>Manuel Pichardo Marcano
We report a peculiar variable blue star in the globular cluster NGC 6397, using Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging. Its position in the colour-magnitude diagrams, and its spectrum, are consistent with this star being a helium core white dwarf (He WD) in a binary system. The optical light curve shows a periodicity at 18.5 hours. We argue that this periodicity is due to the rotation of the WD and possibly due to magnetic spots on the surface of the WD.</description>

In a sample of 9 nearby galaxies ranging from ultra-luminous infrared galaxies to normal spiral galaxies, we measure a remarkably constant CN/HCN line intensity ratio of 0.</description>

The cosmological inflow of a galaxy is speculated to be able to enter the galaxy and enhance the star formation rate (SFR) and black hole accretion rate (BHAR). In this paper, by performing high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations in the framework of {\it MACER}, we investigate the fate of the inflow and its impacts on the evolution of a massive elliptical galaxy. The inflow properties are adopted from the cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG.</description>

      <description>Peter Senchyna
The first JWST spectroscopy of the luminous galaxy GN-z11 simultaneously both established its redshift at $z=10.6$ and revealed a rest-ultraviolet spectrum dominated by signatures of highly-ionized nitrogen, which has so far defied clear interpretation. Here we present a reappraisal of this spectrum in the context of both detailed nebular modeling and nearby metal-poor reference galaxies. The N IV] emission enables the first nebular density measurement in a star-forming galaxy at $z&amp;amp;gt;10$, and reveals evidence for extremely high densities $n_e\gtrsim 10^5$ $\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.</description>

The current paper presents complete results on NGC2683 ($M_{B_T,0}=-19.62$, $D=9.36,Mpc$, $v_{\odot}=411,km,s^{-1}$), an isolated Sc spiral galaxy in the Leo Spur. At the distance of NGC2683, we image the complete volume out to projected radii of $380,kpc$ using a hexagonal arrangement of 7 pointings.</description>

Primordial gravitational waves are one of the most important predictions of inflation theory, and measurements of their imprints on the cosmic microwave background are actively pursued, but not yet succeed until now. Here we point out that measurements of primordial gravitational waves could be conceivable through searching for a signal of second-order tensor perturbations, which were produced due to nonlinear couplings between the linear tensor and scalar perturbations in the early universe.</description>

      <description>Mark Gieles
Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can be retained in globular clusters (GCs) until the present. Simulations of GC evolution find that the relaxation driven mass-loss rate is elevated if BHs are present, especially near dissolution. We capture this behaviour in a parameterised mass-loss rate, benchmarked by results from $N$-body simulations, and use it to evolve an initial GC mass function (GCMF), similar to that of young massive clusters in the Local Universe, to an age of 12 Gyr.</description>

Here, we focus on understanding the typical galactic environment in which binary black hole mergers arise. To this end, we synthesize progenitors of binary black hole mergers as a function of the redshift of progenitor formation, present-day formation galaxy mass, and progenitor stellar metallicity for $240$ star formation and binary evolution models.</description>

In this work, we study the applications of entropy bounds in two toy cosmological models with particle production (annihilation), i.e., radiation-dominated universe and dust-dominated universe. Since entropy bounds are involved in the volume of the thermodynamc system, we need to specify the thermodynamc system in the universe in advance. We consider the co-moving volume and the volume covered by the particle horizon as the target thermodynamic system.</description>

Positron annihilation line at 511~keV is a known component of the gamma-ray diffuse emission. It is believed to be produced in the Galaxy, but there could be possible extragalactic contribution as well. E.g., positrons can be produced in jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and after that accumulate and gradually annihilate in hot gaseous halos around galaxies. In this work we test this hypothesis in application to an individual object &amp;ndash; the Andromeda galaxy (M31) which is close and has a supermassive black hole in its center, which powered an AGN before.</description>

Core-collapse supernovae are a promising potential high-energy neutrino source class. We test for correlation between seven years of IceCube neutrino data and a catalog containing more than 1000 core-collapse supernovae of types IIn and IIP and a sample of stripped-envelope supernovae. We search both for neutrino emission from individual supernovae, and for combined emission from the whole supernova sample through a stacking analysis. No significant spatial or temporal correlation of neutrinos with the cataloged supernovae was found.</description>

We derive average ages and elemental abundances in four bins of stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) ranging from 150$~$km$,$s$^{-1}$ to 250$~$km$,$s$^{-1}$ using a full-spectrum hierarchical Bayesian model. The resulting elemental abundance measurements are precise to 0.</description>

The enhanced activity typical of the core of Seyfert galaxies can drive powerful winds where high-energy phenomena can occur. In spite of their high power content, the number of such non-jetted active galactic nuclei detected in gamma-ray is very limited. In this Letter, we report the detection of a gamma-ray flux from NGC 4151, a Seyfert galaxy located at about 15.8 Mpc. The source is known for hosting ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) in its innermost core through X-ray spectroscopic observations, thereby becoming the first UFO host ever detected in gamma rays.</description>

We present the implementation of two-moment based general-relativistic multi-group radiation transport module in the $\texttt{G}$eneral-relativistic $\texttt{mu}$ltigrid $\texttt{nu}$merical ($\texttt{Gmunu}$) code. On top of solving the general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and the Einstein equations with conformally flat approximations, the code solves the evolution equations of the zeroth- and first-order moments of the radiations. Analytic closure relation is used to obtain the higher order moments and close the system. The finite-volume discretisation has been adopted for the radiation moments.</description>

Interactions between galaxies leave distinguishable imprints in the form of tidal features which hold important clues about their mass assembly. Unfortunately, these structures are difficult to detect because they are low surface brightness features so deep observations are needed. Upcoming surveys promise several orders of magnitude increase in depth and sky coverage, for which automated methods for tidal feature detection will become mandatory. We test the ability of a convolutional neural network to reproduce human visual classifications for tidal detections.</description>

The presence of delayed GeV emission after a strong transient, such as a GRB (Gamma-Ray Burst), in the VHE (Very-High Energy, $E&amp;gt;100$ GeV) band can be the signature of a non-zero magnetic field in the intergalactic medium. We used a synchrotron self-Compton multiwavelength model to infer an analytical description of the intrinsic VHE spectrum (corrected for absorption by the Extragalactic Background Light, EBL) of GRB$,$190114C to predict the lightcurves and SEDs of the delayed emission with Monte Carlo simulations for different IGMF (Intergalactic Magnetic Field) configurations (strengths $B=8\times10^{-21}$ G, $10^{-20}$ G, $3\times 10^{-20}$G and correlation length $\lambda&amp;gt;1$ Mpc), and compared them with the Fermi-LAT (Fermi Large Area Telescope) limits computed for several exposure times.</description>

Dark matter clusters on all scales, therefore it is expected that even substructure should host its own substructure. Using the Extragalactic Distance Database, we searched for dwarf galaxy satellites of dwarf galaxies, i.e. satellite-of-satellite galaxies, corresponding to these substructures-of-substructure. Going through HST data of 117 dwarf galaxies, we report the discovery of a dwarf galaxy around the ultra-diffuse M96 companion M96-DF6 at 10 Mpc. Modelling its structural parameters, we find that it is an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy which is 135 times fainter than its host.</description>

We develop a new method to determine the distance between a galaxy and a foreground screen of atomic hydrogen. In a partially neutral universe, and under the assumption of spherical symmetry, this equates to the radius of a ionized &amp;lsquo;bubble&amp;rsquo; (Rbub) surrounding the galaxy. The method requires an observed Lya equivalent width, velocity offset from systemic, and an input Lya profile for which we adopt scaled versions of the profiles observed in low-z galaxies.</description>

The massive galaxy cluster El Gordo ($z=0.87$) imprints multitudes of gravitationally lensed arcs onto James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) images. Eight bands of NIRCam imaging were obtained in the Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science (PEARLS) program (GTO #1176). PSF-matched photometry across a suite of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and NIRCam filters gives new photometric redshifts. We confirm 54 known image multiplicities and find two new ones and construct a lens model based on the light-traces-mass method.</description>

      <description>Nina S. Sartorio
The first population of X-ray binaries (XRBs) is expected to affect the thermal and ionization states of the gas in the early Universe. Although these X-ray sources are predicted to have important implications for high-redshift observable signals, such as the hydrogen 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn and the cosmic X-ray background, their properties are poorly explored, leaving theoretical models largely uninformed. In this paper we model a population of X-ray binaries arising from zero metallicity stars.</description>

The nature of Type Ia supernovae remains controversial. The youngest remnants of Ia supernovae hold clues to the explosion and to the immediate surroundings. We present a third epoch of Chandra observations of the $\sim600$-year-old Type Ia remnant 0519-69.0 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, extending the time baseline to 21 years from the initial 2000 observations. We find rapid expansion of X-ray emitting material, with an average velocity of 4760 km s$^{-1}$.</description>

Galaxy spins are believed to retain initially acquired tendency of being aligned with the intermediate principal axes of the linear tidal field, which disseminates a prospect of using them as a probe of the early universe physics. This roseate prospect, however, is contingent upon the key assumption that the observable stellar spins of the present galaxies measured at inner radii have the same alignment tendency toward the initial tidal field as their dark matter counterparts measured at virial limits.</description>

When discovered, SN~2017egm was the closest (redshift $z=0.03$) hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) and a rare case that exploded in a massive and metal-rich galaxy. Thus, it has since been extensively observed and studied. We report spectroscopic data showing strong emission at around He~I $\lambda$10,830 and four He~I absorption lines in the optical. Consequently, we classify SN~2017egm as a member of an emerging population of helium-rich SLSNe-I (i.</description>

The large scale limit of the galaxy power spectrum provides a unique window into the early Universe through a possible detection of scale dependent bias produced by Primordial Non Gaussianities. On such large scales, relativistic effects could become important and, potentially, be confused for a primordial signal. In this work we provide the first consistent estimate of such effects in the observed galaxy power spectrum, and discuss their possible degeneracy with local Primordial Non Gaussianities.</description>

While the vast majority of Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) has been identified by wide-field sky surveys in the optical and X-ray bands, recent studies indicate that a considerable fraction of TDEs may be dust obscured, and thus preferentially detected in the infrared (IR) wavebands. In this Letter, we present the discovery of a luminous mid-IR nuclear flare (termed WTP 14adbjsh) identified in a systematic transient search of archival images from the NEOWISE mid-IR survey.</description>

Studies of the three-dimensional (3D) structures of galactic magnetic fields are now entering a new era, with broadband, highly sensitive radio observations and new analysis methods. To reveal the magnetic field configuration from the observed value integrated along the line of sight, it is necessary to derive an appropriate model that can reproduce the observational characteristics. We aim to clarify the relationship between the radiation field and the spatial distribution of physical quantities through pseudo-observations using global 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation results.</description>

With a timing baseline of $\sim$3.5 yr we are able to measure the derivative of the spin frequency ($\dotŒΩ$) for the first five pulsars. Upper limits on the pulsar line-of-sight acceleration are estimated and compared with predictions based on analytical models of the cluster.</description>

The Fanaroff-Riley class II radio galaxy Cygnus A hosts jets which produce radio emission, X-ray cavities, cocoon shocks, and X-ray hotspots where the jet interacts with the ICM. Surrounding one hotspot is a peculiar &amp;ldquo;hole&amp;rdquo; feature which appears as a deficit in X-ray emission. We use relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of a collimated jet interacting with an inclined interface between lobe and cluster plasma to model the basic processes which may lead to such a feature.</description>

Cyanamide (NH2CN) and its isomer, carbodiimide (HNCNH), may form adenine in the interstellar medium (ISM) via a series of reactions. Therefore, they are considered key prebiotic molecules in the study of the origin of life. We used the three-phase NAUTILUS chemical code, which includes the gas, the dust surface, and the icy mantle, to investigate the formation and destruction of cyanamide and carbodiimide. We added over 200 new chemical reactions of the two isomers and related species, and established a relatively complete network.</description>

For this purpose, we utilized a collection of the 9 relaxed galaxy clusters within the X-COP compilation in the redshift range of $z \le 0.1$. We implement the formalism assuming an NFW mass profile for the dark matter density and study the degeneracy present between the mass $\M$ and the chameleon coupling with a high degree of improvement in the constraints for excluded parameter space.</description>

We investigate the properties of mergers that are comparable to the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies. It was previously shown that these mergers occur over a wide range of times ($6-10,$Gyr ago). We find that the merger progenitors span an order of magnitude in their peak stellar mass ($3\times10^8&amp;lt;M_{\star}/\rm{M}{\odot}&amp;lt;4\times10^9$) and include both rotation and pressure-supported galaxies ($0.10&amp;lt;D/T&amp;lt;0.77$). In a minority of cases, the GSE-like debris is comprised of stars from more than one merger progenitor.</description>

Globular clusters (GCs) are found in all types of galaxies and harbor some of the most extreme stellar systems, including black holes that may dynamically assemble into merging binaries (BBHs). Despite their ubiquity, the origin and evolution of GCs remains an open question. Uncertain GC properties, including when they formed, their initial masses and sizes, affect their production rate of BBH mergers. Using the gravitational-wave catalog GWTC-3, we measure that dynamically-assembled BBHs -- those that are consistent with isotropic spin directions -- make up $61^{+29}_{-44}\%$ of the total merger rate, with a local merger rate of $10.</description>

A macroscopic and kinetic relativistic description for a decoupled multi-fluid cosmology endowed with gravitationally induced particle production of all components is proposed. The temperature law for each decoupled particle species is also kinetically derived. The present approach points to the possibility of an exact (semi-classical) quantum-gravitational kinetic treatment by incorporating back reaction effects for an arbitrary set of dominant decoupled components. As an illustration we show that a cosmology driven by creation of cold dark matter and baryons (without dark energy) evolves like $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

Our goal is to quantify the difference in morphology between the stellar and nebular components. We derive the nonparametric morphological indicators of 364 galaxies from the CALIFA Survey. To calculate those indicators, we apply the StatMorph package on the high-quality integral field spectroscopic data cubes, as well as to the most prominent nebular emission-line maps, namely $[OIII]$$\lambda$5007, H$\alpha$, and $[NII]$$\lambda$6583.</description>

Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are X-ray flares with a duration ranging from a few hundred seconds to a few hours. Possible origins include the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate-mass black hole, a supernova shock breakout, and a binary neutron star merger. We present the X-ray light curve and spectrum, and deep optical imaging of the FXT XRT 210423, which has been suggested to be powered by a magnetar produced in a binary neutron star merger.</description>

Globular clusters exhibit abundance variations, defining `multiple populations&amp;amp;#39;, which have prompted a protracted search for their origin. Properties requiring explanation include: the high fraction of polluted stars ($\sim 40{-}90$~percent, correlated with cluster mass), the absence of pollution in young clusters and the lower pollution rate with binarity and distance from the cluster centre. We present a novel mechanism for late delivery of pollutants into stars via accretion of sub-stellar companions.</description>

      <description>First author: Kavita Kumari
We study accretion disk-corona connection in Seyfert 1 galaxies using simultaneous UV/X-ray observations of NGC 4593 (July 14-18, 2016) and NGC 7469 (October 15-19, 2017) performed with AstroSat. We use the X-ray (0.5-7.0 keV) data acquired with the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) and the UV (FUV: 130-180 nm, NUV: 200-300 nm) data obtained with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT). We also use the contemporaneous Swift observations of NGC 4593 and demonstrate AstroSat&amp;rsquo;s capability for X-ray/UV correlation studies.</description>

We present the first systematic study of the detailed shapes of the line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs) in nine massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) using the novel non-parametric modelling code WINGFIT. High-signal spectral observations with MUSE at the VLT allow us to measure between 40 and 400 individual LOSVDs in each galaxy at a signal-to-noise level better than 100 per spectral bin and to trace the LOSVDs all the way out to the highest stellar velocities.</description>

      <description>First author: Benedetta Vulcani
We combine the superior JWST/NIRCam imaging and MUSE data to characterize the properties of galaxies in different environmental conditions in the cluster Abell2744 (z=0.3064) and in its immediate surroundings. Our most striking result is the discovery of a ``red-excess&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; population in F200W-F444W colors both in the cluster regions and the field. These galaxies have normal F115W-F150W colors, but are up to 0.8 mag redder than red sequence galaxies in F200W-F444W.</description>

      <description>First author: Z. N. Osmanov
In the paper we study the process of excitation of Langmuir waves in the magnetospheres of active galactic nuclei (AGN), by taking a general-relativistic expression of the Goldreich-Julian density into account. We considered the linearised set of equations which describe dynamics of the studied mechanism: the Euler equation, the continuity equation and the Poisson equation. After solving the dispersion relation and obtaining the instability growth rate, we explored it versus several physical parameters: electron&amp;rsquo;s and proton&amp;rsquo;s relativistic factors and the mass and luminosity of AGN, which are supposed to be Kerr black holes.</description>

      <description>Nolan Dickson
The distribution of stars and stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes) within globular clusters holds clues about their formation and long-term evolution, with important implications for their initial mass function (IMF) and the formation of black hole mergers. In this work, we present best-fitting multimass models for 37 Milky Way globular clusters, which were inferred from various datasets, including proper motions from Gaia EDR3 and HST, line-of-sight velocities from ground-based spectroscopy and deep stellar mass functions from HST.</description>

      <description>First author: Bastien Carreres
Measurements of the growth rate of structures at $z &amp;lt; 0.1$ with peculiar velocity surveys have the potential of testing the validity of general relativity on cosmic scales. In this work, we present growth-rate measurements from realistic simulated sets of type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We describe our simulation methodology, the light-curve fitting and peculiar velocity estimation. Using the maximum likelihood method, we derive constraints on $f\sigma_8$ using only ZTF SN Ia peculiar velocities.</description>

We use the emulation framework CosmoPower to construct and publicly release neural network emulators of cosmological observables, including the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization power spectra, matter power spectrum, distance-redshift relation, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and redshift-space distortion (RSD) observables, and derived parameters. We train our emulators on Einstein-Boltzmann calculations obtained with high-precision numerical convergence settings, for a wide range of cosmological models including $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $\Lambda$CDM+$N_\mathrm{eff}$, and $\Lambda$CDM+$\Sigma m_\nu$.</description>

      <description>Avi Vajpeyi
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising environments for the assembly of merging binary black hole (BBH) systems. Interest in AGNs as nurseries for merging BBH is rising following the detection of gravitational waves from a BBH system from the purported pair-instability mass gap, most notably, GW190521. Active galactic nuclei have also been invoked to explain the formation of the high-mass-ratio system, GW190814. We draw on simulations of BBH systems in AGN to propose a phenomenological model for the distribution of black hole spins of merging binaries in AGN disks.</description>

We estimate the UV continuum slope ($\beta$) of 465 galaxies (with luminosities of 0.028 $-$ 3.3 $L^{}{z=0.5}$) in the Great Observatories Origins Survey (GOODS) Northern field in the redshift range $z=0.40 - 0.75$. We use two AstroSat/UVIT (N242W, N245M), two HST (F275W, F336W), and a KPNO (U) bands to sample the UV continuum slope of selected galaxies between 1215 and 2600 angstrom. The mean (median) and 1$\sigma$ scatter in the observed $\beta$ are found to be $-1.</description>

The problem of missing baryons in the local universe remains an open question. One propose alternative is that at low redshift missing baryons are in the form of the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). In order to test this idea, we present a detailed analysis of X-ray high-resolution spectra of six extragalactic sources, Mrk 421, 1ES 1028+511, 1ES 1553+113, H2356-309, PKS 0558-504 and PG 1116+215, obtained with the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer to search for signals of WHIM and/or circumgalactic medium (CGM) X-ray absorbing gas.</description>

A new model grid containing 228,016 synthetic red supergiant explosions (Type II supernovae) is introduced. Time evolution of spectral energy distributions from 1 A to 50,000 A (100 frequency bins in a log scale) is computed at each time step up to 500 days after explosion in each model. We provide light curves for the filters of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory&amp;rsquo;s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), Sloan Digital Sky Servey (SDSS), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, but light curves for any photometric filters can be constructed by convolving any filter response functions to the synthetic spectral energy distributions.</description>

JWST observations confirm the existence of galaxies as early as 300Myr and at a higher number density than expected based on galaxy formation models and HST observations. Yet, sources confirmed spectroscopically in the first 500Myr have estimated stellar masses $&amp;lt;5\times10^8M_\odot$, limiting the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for investigating substructure. We present a high-resolution spectroscopic and spatially resolved study of a rare bright galaxy at $z=9.</description>

Massive black hole (BH) mergers will be key targets of future gravitational wave and electromagnetic observational facilities. In order to constrain BH evolution with the information extracted from BH mergers, one must take into account the complex relationship between the population of merging BHs and the global BH population. We analyse the high-resolution cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulation Obelisk, run to redshift $z=3.5$, to study the properties of the merging BH population, and its differences with the underlying global BH population in terms of BH and galaxy properties.</description>

Current cosmological data exhibit discordance between indirect and some direct inferences of the present-day expansion rate, $H_0$. Early dark energy (EDE), which briefly increases the cosmic expansion rate prior to recombination, is a leading scenario for resolving this &amp;ldquo;Hubble tension&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; while preserving a good fit to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. However, this comes at the cost of changes in parameters that affect structure formation in the late-time universe, including the spectral index of scalar perturbations, $n_s$.</description>

Mergers play a complex role in galaxy formation and evolution. Continuing to improve our understanding of these systems require ever larger samples, which can be difficult (even impossible) to select from individual surveys. We use the new platform ESA Datalabs to assemble a catalogue of interacting galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope science archives; this catalogue is larger than previously published catalogues by nearly an order of magnitude.</description>

We study the impact of galaxy mergers on stellar population profiles/gradients of early-type galaxies (ETGs) using ETGs at $z&amp;amp;lt;0.055$ in the Stripe 82 region of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and MaNGA integral field unit spectroscopic data. Tidal features around ETGs, which are detected from deep coadded images, are regarded as direct observational evidence for recent mergers. We find that ETGs with tidal features have less negative metallicity gradients and more positive age gradients than ETGs without tidal features at $M_\mathrm{star}\gtrsim10^{10.</description>

We select 753 S0 galaxies from the internal Product Lauch-10 of MaNGA survey (MPL-10) and find that $\sim$11% of S0 galaxies show gas-star kinematic misalignments, which is higher than the misaligned fraction in spiral ($\sim$1%) and elliptical galaxies ($\sim$6%) in MPL-10. If we only consider the emission-line galaxies (401 emission-line S0s), the misaligned fraction in S0s increases to $\sim$20%. In S0s, the kinematic misalignments are more common than the merger remnant features ($\sim$8%).</description>

We present a detailed analysis of numerical discreteness errors in two-species, gravity-only, cosmological simulations using the density power spectrum as a diagnostic probe. In a simple setup where both species are initialized with the same total matter transfer function, biased growth of power forms on small scales when the solver force resolution is finer than the mean interparticle separation. The artificial bias is more severe when individual density and velocity transfer functions are applied.</description>

      <description>First author: Ivan Almeida
We present a simple model for low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) feedback through thermal winds produced by a hot accretion flow. The wind carries considerable energy and deposits it on the host galaxy at kiloparsec scales and beyond, heating the galactic gas thereby quenching star formation. Our model predicts that the typical LLAGN can quench more than $10%$ of star formation in its host galaxy. We find that long-lived LLAGN winds from supermassive black holes (SMBH) with masses $\geq 10^8 M_{\odot}$ and mass accretion rates $\dot{M} &amp;gt; 10^{-3}\dot{M}{\rm Edd}$ can prevent gas collapse and significantly quench galactic star formation compared to a scenario without AGN, if the wind persists over 1 Myr.</description>

Aims. Previous studies reported an alignment of the major axes of radio galaxies on various angular scales. Here, we study the alignment of radio galaxies in the ELAIS-N1 Low Frequency ARray (LOFAR) deep field, which covers an area of 25 $\rm deg^2$. \newline Methods. The low noise level of about 20$ \rm ~ \mu Jy/beam$ of the LOFAR deep field observations at 150 MHz enabled the identification of 447 extended ($&amp;gt; 30 \rm &amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;$) radio galaxies for which we have measured the major axis position angle.</description>

      <description>First author: G. Angora
Galaxy-scale strong lenses in galaxy clusters provide a unique tool to investigate their inner mass distribution and the sub-halo density profiles in the low-mass regime, which can be compared with the predictions from cosmological simulations. We search for galaxy-galaxy strong-lensing systems in HST multi-band imaging of galaxy cluster cores from the CLASH and HFF programs by exploring the classification capabilities of deep learning techniques. Convolutional neural networks are trained utilising highly-realistic simulations of galaxy-scale strong lenses injected into the HST cluster fields around cluster members.</description>

To better understand the formation of large, low surface brightness galaxies, we measure the correlation function between ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidates and Milky Way analogs (MWAs). We find that (1) the projected radial distribution of UDG satellites (projected surface density $\propto r^{-0.84\pm0.06}$) is consistent with that of normal satellite galaxies, (2) the number of UDG satellites per MWA ($S_{\rm UDG}$) is $\sim 0.5\pm0.1$ over projected radii from 20 to 250 kpc and $-17&amp;lt; M_r &amp;lt; -13.</description>
