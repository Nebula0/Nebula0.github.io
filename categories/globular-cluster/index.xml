      <description>T. Panurach
The conditions under which accreting neutron stars launch radio-emitting jets and/or outflows are still poorly understood. The ultracompact X-ray binary X1850--087, located in the globular cluster NGC 6712, is a persistent atoll-type X-ray source that has previously shown unusual radio continuum variability. Here we present the results of a pilot radio monitoring program of X1850--087 undertaken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, with simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous Swift/XRT data obtained at each epoch.</description>

      <title>N-enhancement in GN-z11: First evidence for supermassive stars nucleosynthesis in proto-globular clusters-like conditions at high redshift ?</title>

      <description>C. Charbonnel
Unusually high N/O abundances were recently reported for a very compact, intensively star-forming object GN-z11 at z=10.6 from JWST/NIRSpec observations. We present an empirical comparison with the C, N, and O abundance ratios in Galactic globular clusters (GCs) over a large metallicity range. We show that hot hydrogen-burning nucleosynthesis within supermassive stars (SMS) formed through runaway collisions can consistently explain the observed abundances ratio in GN-z11 and in GCs.</description>

      <description>Marco Dall&amp;rsquo;Amico
Eccentric mergers are a signature of the dynamical formation channel of binary black holes (BBHs) in dense stellar environments and hierarchical triple systems. Here, we investigate the production of eccentric mergers via binary-single interactions, by means of $2.5\times10^{5}$ direct $\textit{N}$-body simulations. Our simulations include post-Newtonian terms up to the 2.5th order and are designed to reflect the environmental conditions of young (YSCs), globular (GCs), and nuclear star clusters (NSCs).</description>

      <description>Chow-Choong Ngeow
SX Phoenicis (SXP) variables are short period pulsating stars that exhibit a period-luminosity (PL) relation. We derived the gri-band PL and extinction-free period-Wesenheit (PW) relations, as well as the period-color (PC) and reddening-free period-Q-index (PQ) relations for 47 SXP stars in located in 21 globular clusters using the optical light curves taken from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). These empirically relations were derived for the first time in the gri filters except for the g-band PL relation.</description>

      <description>Roman Tkachenko
We make use of recent estimates for the parameters of the Milky Way&amp;amp;#39;s halo globular clusters and study the influence of the galactic bar on the dynamics of these clusters by computing their orbits. We use both an axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric galactic potentials, which include the rotating elongated bar/bulge structure. We account for observational errors both in the positions and in the velocities of the globular clusters and explore the influence of the bar on cluster&amp;amp;#39;s evolution.</description>

      <title>A candidate magnetic helium core white dwarf in the globular cluster NGC 6397</title>

      <description>Manuel Pichardo Marcano
We report a peculiar variable blue star in the globular cluster NGC 6397, using Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging. Its position in the colour-magnitude diagrams, and its spectrum, are consistent with this star being a helium core white dwarf (He WD) in a binary system. The optical light curve shows a periodicity at 18.5 hours. We argue that this periodicity is due to the rotation of the WD and possibly due to magnetic spots on the surface of the WD.</description>

      <description>Peter Senchyna
The first JWST spectroscopy of the luminous galaxy GN-z11 simultaneously both established its redshift at $z=10.6$ and revealed a rest-ultraviolet spectrum dominated by signatures of highly-ionized nitrogen, which has so far defied clear interpretation. Here we present a reappraisal of this spectrum in the context of both detailed nebular modeling and nearby metal-poor reference galaxies. The N IV] emission enables the first nebular density measurement in a star-forming galaxy at $z&amp;amp;gt;10$, and reveals evidence for extremely high densities $n_e\gtrsim 10^5$ $\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.</description>

      <title>The mass-loss rates of star clusters with stellar-mass black holes: implications for the globular cluster mass function</title>

      <description>Mark Gieles
Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can be retained in globular clusters (GCs) until the present. Simulations of GC evolution find that the relaxation driven mass-loss rate is elevated if BHs are present, especially near dissolution. We capture this behaviour in a parameterised mass-loss rate, benchmarked by results from $N$-body simulations, and use it to evolve an initial GC mass function (GCMF), similar to that of young massive clusters in the Local Universe, to an age of 12 Gyr.</description>

      <description>S. Dai
We present the timing of the first five millisecond pulsars discovered in the globular cluster Omega Centauri and the discovery of a pulsar with a spin period of 3.68 ms. With a timing baseline of $\sim$3.5 yr we are able to measure the derivative of the spin frequency ($\dotν$) for the first five pulsars. Upper limits on the pulsar line-of-sight acceleration are estimated and compared with predictions based on analytical models of the cluster.</description>

      <description>Maya Fishbach
Globular clusters (GCs) are found in all types of galaxies and harbor some of the most extreme stellar systems, including black holes that may dynamically assemble into merging binaries (BBHs). Despite their ubiquity, the origin and evolution of GCs remains an open question. Uncertain GC properties, including when they formed, their initial masses and sizes, affect their production rate of BBH mergers. Using the gravitational-wave catalog GWTC-3, we measure that dynamically-assembled BBHs -- those that are consistent with isotropic spin directions -- make up $61^{+29}_{-44}\%$ of the total merger rate, with a local merger rate of $10.</description>

      <description>Andrew J. Winter
Globular clusters exhibit abundance variations, defining `multiple populations&amp;amp;#39;, which have prompted a protracted search for their origin. Properties requiring explanation include: the high fraction of polluted stars ($\sim 40{-}90$~percent, correlated with cluster mass), the absence of pollution in young clusters and the lower pollution rate with binarity and distance from the cluster centre. We present a novel mechanism for late delivery of pollutants into stars via accretion of sub-stellar companions.</description>

      <description>Nolan Dickson
The distribution of stars and stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes) within globular clusters holds clues about their formation and long-term evolution, with important implications for their initial mass function (IMF) and the formation of black hole mergers. In this work, we present best-fitting multimass models for 37 Milky Way globular clusters, which were inferred from various datasets, including proper motions from Gaia EDR3 and HST, line-of-sight velocities from ground-based spectroscopy and deep stellar mass functions from HST.</description>

We have performed a systematic study of the rotational, orbital and X-ray properties of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) and compared their nature with those of the MSPs in the Galactic field (GF). We found that GC MSPs generally rotate slower than their counterparts in the GF. Different from the expectation of a simple recycling scenario, no evidence for the correlation between the orbital period and the rotation period can be found from the MSP binaries in GCs.</description>

Direct observational evidence for the creation of nuclear star clusters (NSCs) is needed to support the proposed scenarios for their formation. We have analyzed the dwarf galaxy UGC 7346, located in the peripheral regions of the Virgo Cluster, to highlight a series of properties that indicate the formation of a NSC caught in its earlier stages. First, we report remnants of a past interaction in the form of diffuse streams or shells, suggesting a recent merge of two dwarf galaxies with a 1:5 stellar mass ratio.</description>

The assembly history of the Milky Way (MW) is a rapidly evolving subject, with numerous small accretion events and at least one major merger proposed in the MW&amp;amp;#39;s history. Accreted alongside these dwarf galaxies are globular clusters (GCs), which act as spatially coherent remnants of these past events. Using high precision differential abundance measurements from our recently published study, we investigate the likelihood that the MW clusters NGC 362 and NGC 288 are galactic siblings, accreted as part of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger.</description>

      <description>Pierfrancesco Di Cintio
We recently introduced a new method for simulating collisional gravitational N-body systems with approximately linear time scaling with $N$, based on the Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) scheme, previously applied in Plasma Physics. We simulate globular clusters with a realistic number of stellar particles (at least up to several times $10^6$) on a standard workstation. We simulate clusters hosting an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH), probing a broad range of BH-cluster and BH-average-star mass ratios, unrestricted by the computational constraints affecting direct N-body codes.</description>

Globular clusters display an anticorrelation between the fraction of the first generation of stars ($N({\rm G1})/N({\rm tot})$) and the slope of the present-day mass function of the clusters ($α_{pd}$), which is particularly significant for massive clusters. In the framework of the binary-mediated collision scenario for the formation of the second-generation stars in globular clusters, we test the effect of a varying stellar initial mass function (IMF) of the G1 stars on the $(N({\rm G1})/N({\rm tot}))-α_{pd}$ anticorrelation.</description>

      <description>Yuka Doke
One of the most intriguing properties of the GD-1 stellar stream is the existence of three gaps. If these gaps were formed by close encounters with dark matter subhalos, the GD-1 stream opens an exciting window through which we can see the size, mass, and velocity distributions of the dark matter subhalos in the Milky Way. However, in order to use the GD-1 stream as a probe of the dark matter substructure, we need to disprove that these gaps are not due to the perturbations from baryonic components of the Milky Way.</description>

      <description>Rajendra P. Gupta
Equations governing the evolution of a star involve multiple coupling constants. Thus, the time it spends as a main-sequence star can be expected to depend on whether or not such constants vary over the time scale of stellar evolution. When the star belongs to a globular cluster, the star&amp;amp;#39;s age cannot exceed that of the globular cluster, and the latter cannot exceed the age of the Universe.</description>

We report our analysis results for the globular cluster (GC) NGC~6341 (M92), as a millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1717$+$4308A has recently been reported found in this GC. The data used are from the Large Area Telescope onboard the {\it Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}. We detect $γ$-ray pulsations of the MSP at a $4.4σ$ confidence level (the corresponding weighted H-test value is $\sim$28.4). This MSP, the fourth $γ$-ray pulsar found in a GC, does not have significant off-pulse emission and has $γ$-ray luminosity and efficiency $1.</description>

The F115W vs. F115W-F322W2 CMD from NIRCam shows that, below the knee, the MS stars span a wide color range, where the majority of M-dwarfs exhibit blue colors, and a tail of stars are distributed toward the red.</description>

      <description>Sven Martens
The formation process of multiple populations in globular clusters is still up for debate. Kinematic differences between the populations are particularly interesting in this respect, because they allow us to distinguish between single-epoch formation scenarios and multi-epoch formation scenarios. We analyze the kinematics of 25 globular clusters and aim to find kinematic differences between multiple populations to constrain their formation process. We split red-giant branch (RGB) stars in each cluster into three populations (P1, P2, P3) for the type-II clusters and two populations (P1 and P2) otherwise using Hubble photometry.</description>

NGC 4839 is the brightest galaxy (cD) of the NGC 4839 group at $R\approx 1$ Mpc in the south-west of the Coma cluster, which is known to be falling into Coma. However, it has been controversial whether it is in the first phase of infall or in the second phase of infall after passing the Coma center. We present a wide field study of globular clusters (GCs) in NGC 4839 and its environment based on Hyper Suprime-Cam $gr$ images in the Subaru archive.</description>

Multiple populations (MPs), characterized by variations in light elemental abundances, have been found in stellar clusters in the Milky Way, Magellanic Clouds, as well as several other dwarf galaxies. Based on a large amount of observations, mass has been suggested to be a key parameter affecting the presence and appearance of MPs in stellar clusters. To further investigate the existence of MPs in low-mass clusters and explore the mass threshold for MP formation, we carried out a project studying the stellar population composition in several low-mass Galactic globular clusters.</description>

      <description>Chia-Hsuan Cheng,
To investigate the dynamical properties of globular clusters, the surface brightness and kinematic data were collected and fitted to a family of lowered isothermal models called LIMEPY models. For 18 studied globular clusters, the amounts of concentration, truncation, and anisotropy were determined. In addition, the cluster mass, half-mass radius, distance, and mass-to-light ratio were also obtained. In general, LIMEPY models could describe these clusters well. Among these 18 clusters, NGC 5139, NGC 6388, and NGC 7078 were claimed to be candidates to host intermediate-mass black holes in literature.</description>

      <description>Maryna Ishchenko,
This study is aimed at investigating the dynamic evolution of the orbits of stellar globular clusters (GCs). To integrate the orbits backward in time, the authors use models of the time-varying potentials derived from cosmological simulations, which are closest to the potential of the Galaxy. This allows for estimating the probability of close passages (collisions) of GCs with respect to each other and the Galactic center (GalC) in the Galaxy undergoing dynamic changes in the past.</description>

      <description>Salvatore Ferrone
We present the e-TidalGCs Project which aims at modeling and predicting the extra-tidal features surrounding all Galactic globular clusters for which 6D phase space information, masses and sizes are available (currently 159 globular clusters). We focus the analysis and presentation of the results on the distribution of extra-tidal material on the sky, and on the different structures found at different heliocentric distances. We emphasize the wide variety of morphologies found: beyond the canonical tidal tails, our models reveal that the extra-tidal features generated by globular clusters take a wide variety of shapes, from thin and elongated shapes, to thick, and complex halo-like structures.</description>

      <description>M. Libralato
Our understanding of the kinematic properties of multiple stellar populations (mPOPs) in Galactic globular clusters (GCs) is still limited compared to what we know about their chemical and photometric characteristics. Such limitation arises from the lack of a comprehensive observational investigation of this topic. Here we present the first homogeneous kinematic analysis of mPOPs in 56 GCs based on high-precision proper motions computed with Hubble Space Telescope data.</description>

      <description>J. M. Diego
We present a free-form model of SMACS0723, the first cluster observed with JWST. This model makes no strong assumptions about the distribution of mass (mostly dark matter) in the cluster and we use it to study the possible correlation between dark matter with the intracluster light and distribution of globular clusters. To explore the uncertainty in mass modelling, we derive three lens models based on spectroscopically confirmed systems and new candidate systems with redshifts predicted by the lens model derived from the spectroscopic systems.</description>

      <description>Frederika Phipps
We investigate the formation of infant globular cluster (GC) candidates in high-resolution cosmological simulations from the First Billion Years (FiBY) project. By analysing the evolution of the systems in the energy and angular momentum plane, we identify the redshift at which the infant GCs first became gravitationally bound, and we find evidence of radial infall of their gaseous and stellar components. The collapse appears to be driven by internal self-gravity, however, the initial trigger is sourced from the external environment.</description>

      <description>Steffani M. Grondin
Three-body interactions can eject stars from the core of a globular cluster, causing them to enter the Galactic halo as extra-tidal stars. While finding extra-tidal stars is imperative for understanding cluster evolution, connecting isolated extra-tidal field stars back to their birth cluster is extremely difficult. In this work, we present a new methodology consisting of high-dimensional data analysis and a particle spray code to identify extra-tidal stars of any Galactic globular cluster using M3 as a case study.</description>

      <description>Geraint F. Lewis
Based upon a metallicity selection, we identify a significant sub-population of the inner halo globular clusters in the Andromeda Galaxy which we name the Dulais Structure. It is distinguished as a co-rotating group of 10-20 globular clusters which appear to be kinematically distinct from, and on average more metal-poor than, the majority of the inner halo population. Intriguingly, the orbital axis of this Dulais Structure is closely aligned with that of the younger accretion event recently identified using a sub-population of globular clusters in the outer halo of Andromeda, and this is strongly suggestive of a causal relationship between the two.</description>

It is well known that Globular cluster systems are different among galaxies. Here we test to which degree these differences remain on the scale of galaxy clusters by comparing the globular clusters (GCs) in optical surveys of the Virgo galaxy cluster (ACSVCS) and the Fornax galaxy cluster (ACSFCS) in Kolmogorov-Smirnoff Tests. Both surveys were obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope, and contain thousands of GCs in dozens of galaxies each.</description>

We used a combination of high-resolution optical images acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope and near-IR wide-field data to investigate the stellar density profile and the population of blue straggler star (BSS) in the Galactic globular cluster NGC6256, with the aim of probing its current stage of internal dynamical evolution. We found that the inner stellar density profile significantly deviates from a King model while is well reproduced by a steep cusp with a power-law slope alpha=-0.</description>

Globular Clusters (GCs) provide valuable insight into the properties of their host galaxies&amp;rsquo; dark matter halos. Using N-body simulations incorporating semianalytic dynamical friction and GC-GC merger prescriptions, we study the evolution of GC radial distributions and mass functions in cuspy and cored dark matter halos. Modeling the dynamics of the GC-rich system in the dwarf galaxy UGC7369, we find that friction-induced inspiral and subsequent mergers of massive GCs can naturally and robustly explain the mass segregation of the GCs and the existence of a nuclear star cluster (NSC).</description>

      <description>Kanwar Preet Kaur
The fundamentals of estimating essential stellar parameters of an open cluster-NGC 2360 and globular clusters-NGC 5272 are presented extensively in this work. Here, the evaluation of stellar parameters, by manually fitting the appropriate isochrones on the color magnitude diagrams (CMDs), of the selected star clusters is discussed comprehensively. Aperture photometry and PSF fitting photometry are conducted on g, r, and i standard band filter images of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) using the aperture photometry tool (APT) to obtain the respective CMDs.</description>

Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry is providing an extensive analysis of globular clusters (GCs). In particular, the pseudo two-colour diagram dubbed &#39;chromosome map (ChM)&#39; allowed to detect and characterize their multiple populations with unprecedented detail. The main limitation of these studies is the small field of view of HST, which makes it challenging to investigate some important aspects of the multiple populations, such as their spatial distributions and the internal kinematics in the outermost cluster regions.</description>

We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging of 14 gas-rich, low surface brightness and ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the field at distances of 25-36 Mpc. An inspection of point-like sources brighter than the turnover magnitude of the globular cluster luminosity function and within twice the half-light radii of each galaxy reveals that, unlike those in denser environments, gas-rich, field UDGs host very few old globular clusters (GCs). Most of the targets (nine) have zero candidate GCs, with the remainder having one or two candidates each.</description>

      <description>Kenji Bekki
We discuss a GC formation scenario in which the first generation (1G) of single asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and intermediate-mass close binaries (IMCBs) eject gas, from which the second generation (2G) of stars can be formed. The two key parameters in the scenario are the fractions of binary stars (f_b) and the slopes (alpha) of the stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) for 1G stars. Principle results derived by analytic and one-zone models of GC formation are as follows.</description>

      <description>Eduardo Vitral
We seek to differentiate dynamical and morphological attributes between globular clusters (GCs) that were formed inside their own dark matter (DM) mini-halo, and those who were not. We employ high resolution full N-body simulations on GPU of GCs with and without a DM mini-halo, orbiting a Fornax-like dwarf galaxy. For GCs with DM, we observe that this dark extra mass triggers a tidal radius growth that allows the mini-halo to act as a protective shield against tidal stripping, being itself stripped beforehand the stars.</description>
