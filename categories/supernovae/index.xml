      <description>First author: Andrea P. Nagy
Here, we present a systematic study of 59 stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) (including Type IIb, Ib, Ic, and transitional events) to map a possible reason for the so-called mass-discrepancy problem. In this scenario, we assume the tension between the estimated ejected masses from early- and late-time light curves (LC) is due to approximations generally used in analytical models. First, we examine the assumption that the R-band light curve is indeed a good approximation of the bolometric light curve.</description>

      <title>The impact of weak lensing on Type Ia supernovae luminosity distances</title>

      <description>First author: Paul Shah
When Type Ia supernovae are used to infer cosmological parameters, their luminosities are compared to those from a homogeneous cosmology. In this note we propose a test to examine to what degree SN Ia have been observed on lines of sight where the average matter density is \textit{not} representative of the homogeneous background. We use a modification to the Tripp estimator to explicitly de-lens SN Ia magnitudes, and show that it reduces scatter.</description>

      <title>A search for relativistic ejecta in a sample of ZTF broad-lined Type Ic supernovae</title>

      <description>First author: Alessandra Corsi
The dividing line between gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and ordinary stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is yet to be fully understood. Observationally mapping the variety of ejecta outcomes (ultra-relativistic, mildly-relativistic or non-relativistic) in SNe of Type Ic with broad lines (Ic-BL) can provide a key test to stellar explosion models. However, this requires large samples of the rare Ic-BL events with follow-up observations in the radio, where fast ejecta can be probed largely free of geometry and viewing angle effects.</description>

      <title>Revealing the effects of curvature on the cosmological models</title>

      <description>First author: Weiqiang Yang
In this paper we consider the effects of adding curvature in extended cosmologies involving a free-to-vary neutrino sector and different parametrizations of Dark Energy (DE). We make use of the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization data, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Pantheon type Ia Supernovae data. Our main result is that a non-flat Universe cannot be discarded in light of the current astronomical data, because we find an indication for a closed Universe in most of the DE cosmologies explored in this work.</description>

      <description>First author: Dylan A. Dutton
Built in 2004, the Skynet robotic telescope network originally consisted of six 0.4 m telescopes located at the Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory in the Chilean Andes. The network was designed to carry out simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) when they are only tens of seconds old. To date, the network has been expanded to ~20 telescopes, including a 20 m radio telescope, that span four continents and five countries.</description>

      <title>Probing the low-mass end of core-collapse supernovae using a sample of strongly-stripped Calcium-rich Type IIb Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>

      <description>First author: Kaustav K. Das
The fate of stars in the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) range $\approx 8-12$ Msun is unclear. They could evolve to form white dwarfs or explode as electron-capture supernovae (SNe) or iron core-collapse SNe (CCSNe). Even though the initial mass function indicates that this mass range should account for over 40% of all CCSNe progenitors, few have been observationally confirmed, likely owing to the faintness and rapid evolution of these transients.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional core-collapse supernovae with complex magnetic structures: II. Rotational instabilities and multimessenger signatures</title>

      <description>First author: Matteo Bugli
The gravitational collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars can lead to the onset of the low $T/|W|$ instability within the central proto-neutron star (PNS), which leaves strong signatures in both the gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino emission. Strong large-scale magnetic fields are usually invoked to explain outstanding stellar explosions of rapidly rotating progenitors, but their impact on the growth of such instability has not yet been cleared.</description>

      <title>Explosive nucleosynthesis with fast neutrino-flavor conversion in core-collapse supernovae</title>

      <description>First author: Shin-ichiro Fujimoto
Fast neutrino -flavor conversion (FFC) is a possible game-changing ingredient in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) theory. In this Letter, we examine the impact of FFC on explosive nucleosynthesis by including the effects of FFC in conjunction with asymmetric neutrino emission into nucleosynthetic computations in a parametric way. We find that the ejecta compositions are not appreciably affected by FFC for elements lighter than Co, while the compositions are influenced by FFC for the heavier elements.</description>

      <title>Pre-maximum spectroscopic diversity of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae</title>

      <description>First author: Réka Könyves-Tóth
We search for the reasons behind the spectroscopic diversity of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) in the pre-maximum phase. Our analysis is a continuation of the paper of \citet{ktr21}, who disclosed two new subtypes of SLSNe-I characterized by the presence/absence of a W-shaped absorption feature in their pre-maximum spectra between 4000 and 5000 \AA (called Type~W and Type~15bn, respectively). However, the physical cause of this bimodality is still uncertain.</description>
