      <title>The viability of ultralight bosonic dark matter in dwarf galaxies</title>

The dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies holds a wealth of information on the fundamental properties and interactions of the dark matter particle. In this paper, we study whether ultralight bosonic dark matter is consistent with the gravitational potential extracted from stellar kinematics. We use velocity dispersion measurements to constrain models for halo mass and particle mass. The posterior likelihood is multimodal. Particle masses of order $m\sim 10^{-22} {\rm{eV}}$ require halos of mass in excess of $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$, while particle mass of order $m \gtrsim 10^{-20}{\rm{eV}}$ are favored by halos of mass $\sim [10^{8} - 10^{9}] M_\odot$, with a similar behavior to cold dark matter.</description>

The metallicity distributions of globular cluster (GC) systems in galaxies are a critical test of any GC formation scenario. In this work, we investigate the predicted GC metallicity distributions of galaxies in the MOdelling Star cluster population Assembly In Cosmological Simulations within EAGLE (E-MOSAICS) simulation of a representative cosmological volume ($L = 34.4$ comoving Mpc). We find that the predicted GC metallicity distributions and median metallicities from the fiducial E-MOSAICS GC formation model agree well the observed distributions, except for galaxies with masses $M_\ast \sim 2 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, which contain an overabundance of metal-rich GCs.</description>

We report the discovery of an ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy, Pegasus W, located on the far side of the Milky Way-M31 system and outside the virial radius of M31. The distance to the galaxy is 915 (+60/-91) kpc, measured using the luminosity of horizontal branch (HB) stars identified in Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging. The galaxy has a half-light radius (r_h) of 100 (+11/-13) pc, M_V = -7.</description>

We present the star formation histories (SFHs) of early-type dwarf galaxies, dSphs and dEs, in the local universe within z=0.01. The SFHs of early-type dwarf galaxies are characterized by pre-enriched, metal-poor old stellar populations, absence of moderately old stars that have ages of a few Gyr. There are some differences in the SFHs of dSphs and dEs. In particular, dSphs formed old ($\gtrsim10$ Gyr old) metal-poor stars $\sim2$ times more than dEs.</description>

The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20200120E is exceptional because of its proximity and association with a globular cluster. Here we report $60$ bursts detected with the Effelsberg telescope at 1.4 GHz. We observe large variations in the burst rate, and report the first FRB 20200120E `burst storm&amp;amp;#39;, where the source suddenly became active and 53 bursts (fluence $\geq 0.04$ Jy ms) occurred within only 40 minutes.</description>

We have studied the system of globular clusters (GCs) that formed in other galaxies and eventually accreted onto the Milky Way. Thus, the samples of GCs belonging to different tidal streams, obtained on the basis of the latest data from the Gaia observatory, were taken from the literature. We measured the anisotropy of the distribution of these GCs using the gyration tensor and found that the distribution of GCs in the streams is isotropic.</description>

      <description>Yingtian Chen
The existence of globular clusters (GCs) in a few satellite galaxies, and their absence in majority of dwarf galaxies, present a challenge for models attempting to understand the origins of GCs. In addition to GC presence appearing stochastic and difficult to describe with average trends, in the smallest satellite galaxies GCs contribute a substantial fraction of total stellar mass. We investigate the stochasticity and number of GCs in dwarf galaxies using an updated version of our model that links the formation of GCs to the growth of the host galaxy mass.</description>

The information on Galactic assembly time is imprinted on the chemodynamics of globular clusters. This makes them important probes that help us to understand the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Discerning between in-situ and ex-situ origin of these objects is difficult when we study the Galactic bulge, which is the most complex and mixed component of the Milky Way. To investigate the early evolution of the Galactic bulge, we analysed the globular cluster NGC 6355.</description>

      <description>John Pharo,
We present measurements of $[NeIII]$ λ3869 emission in z~1 low-mass galaxies taken from the Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic surveys HALO7D and DEEPWinds. We identify 167 individual galaxies with significant $[NeIII]$ emission lines, including 112 &amp;amp;#34;dwarf&amp;amp;#34; galaxies with log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &amp;amp;lt; 9.5, with 0.3 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 1.4. We also measure $[NeIII]$ emission from composite spectra derived from all $[OII]$λλ3727,3729 line emitters in this range. This provides a unique sample of $[NeIII]$-emitters in the gap between well-studied emitters at z = 0 and 2 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 3.</description>

      <description>Kristen. B. W. McQuinn
The flattened, possibly co-rotating plane of satellite galaxies around Centaurus A, if more than a fortuitous alignment, adds to the pre-existing tension between the well-studied Milky Way and M31 planes and the $Λ$CDM model of structure formation. It was recently reported that the Centaurus A satellite plane (CASP) may be rotationally supported, but a further understanding of the system&amp;amp;#39;s kinematics is elusive in the absence of full three-dimensional velocities.</description>

      <description>Anirudh Chiti
We present chemical abundances and velocities of five stars between 0.3 kpc to 1.1 kpc from the center of the Tucana II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) from high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy. We find that every star is deficient in metals (-3.6 &amp;amp;lt; $[Fe/H]$ &amp;amp;lt; -1.9) and in neutron-capture elements as is characteristic of UFD stars, unambiguously confirming their association with Tucana II. Other chemical abundances (e.g., C, iron-peak) largely follow UFD trends and suggest that faint core-collapse supernovae (SNe) dominated the early evolution of Tucana II.</description>

Using the data from Gaia (ESA) Data Release 2 we performed the orbital calculations of globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way. To explore possible close encounters (or collisions) between the GCs, using our own developed high-order phi-GRAPE code, we integrated backward and forward the orbits of 119 objects with reliable positions and proper motions. In calculations, we adopted a realistic axisymmetric Galactic potential (bulge + disk + halo).</description>

      <description>Isabel M. E. Santos-Santos,
We use the APOSTLE Local Group (LG) cosmological hydro-simulations to examine the properties of &amp;amp;#34;backsplash&amp;amp;#34; galaxies, i.e, dwarfs which were within the virial boundaries of the Milky Way (MW) or M31 in the past, but are today outside their virial radius ($r_{200}$). More than half of all dwarfs between $1-2\,r_{200}$ of each primary are backsplash. More distant backsplash systems, i.e., those reaching distances well beyond $2\,r_{200}$, are typically close to apocentre of nearly radial orbits, and, therefore, essentially at rest relative to their primary.</description>

      <description>David J. Whitworth
Many studies concluded that magnetic fields suppress star formation in molecular clouds and Milky Way like galaxies. However, most of these studies are based on fully developed fields that have reached the saturation level, with little work on investigating how an initial weak primordial field affects star formation in low metallicity environments. In this paper, we investigate the impact of a weak initial field on low metallicity dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <description>Timothy Gburek,
We present a Keck/MOSFIRE, rest-optical, composite spectrum of 16 typical, gravitationally-lensed, star-forming, dwarf galaxies at $1.7 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.6$ ($z_{\rm{mean}}=2.30$), all chosen independent of emission-line strength. These galaxies have a median stellar mass of $\log(M_\ast/\rm{M_\odot})_{\rm{med}} = 8.29^{+0.51}_{-0.43}$ and a median star formation rate of $\rm{SFR_{Hα}^{med} = 2.25^{+2.15}_{-1.26}\ M_\odot\ yr^{-1}}$. We measure the faint, electron-temperature-sensitive, $[O III]$ $λ$4363 emission line at $2.5σ$ ($4.1σ$) significance when considering a bootstrapped (statistical-only) uncertainty spectrum.</description>

Accreted stellar populations are comprised of the remnants of destroyed galaxies, and often dominate the `stellar haloes&amp;amp;#39; of galaxies such as the Milky Way (MW). This ensemble of external contributors is a key indicator of the past assembly history of a galaxy. We introduce a novel statistical method that uses the unbinned metallicity distribution function (MDF) of a stellar population to estimate the mass spectrum of its progenitors.</description>

      <description>Francois Hammer
Halo inhabitants are individual stars, stellar streams, star and globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies. Here we compare the two last categories that include objects of similar stellar mass, which are often studied as self-dynamical equilibrium systems. We discover that the half-light radius of globular clusters depends on their orbital pericenter and total energy, and that Milky Way (MW) tides may explain the observed correlation. We also suggest that the accretion epoch of stellar systems in the MW halo can be calibrated by the total orbital energy, and that such a relation is due to both the mass growth of the MW and dynamical friction affecting mostly satellites with numerous orbits.</description>

Dwarf galaxies located in extremely under-dense cosmic voids are excellent test-beds for disentangling the effects of large-scale environment on galaxy formation and evolution. We present integral field spectroscopy for low-mass galaxies ($M_{\star}=10^{7}-10^{9}~M_{\odot}$) located inside (N=21) and outside (N=9) cosmic voids using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). Using measurements of stellar line-of-sight rotational velocity $v_{\mathrm{rot}}$ and velocity dispersion $σ_{\star}$, we test the tidal stirring hypothesis, which posits that dwarf spheroidal galaxies are formed through tidal interactions with more massive host galaxies.</description>

We use the kinematic data of the stars in eight dwarf spheroidal galaxies to assess whether $f(R)$ gravity can fit the observed profiles of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of these systems without resorting to dark matter. Our model assumes that each galaxy is spherically symmetric and has a constant velocity anisotropy parameter $β$ and constant mass-to-light ratio consistent with stellar population synthesis models. We solve the spherical Jeans equation that includes the Yukawa-like gravitational potential appearing in the weak field limit of $f(R)$ gravity, and a Plummer density profile for the stellar distribution.</description>

      <description>M. Mezcua,
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to originate from early Universe seed black holes of mass $M_\mathrm{BH} \sim 10^2$-10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$ and grown through cosmic time. Such seeds could be powering the active galactic nuclei (AGN) found in today&amp;amp;#39;s dwarf galaxies. However, probing a connection between the early seeds and local SMBHs has not yet been observationally possible. Massive black holes hosted in dwarf galaxies at intermediate redshifts, on the other hand, may represent the evolved counterparts of the seeds formed at very early times.</description>

      <description>A. Marasco,
Baryonic feedback is expected to play a key role in regulating the star formation of low-mass galaxies by producing galaxy-scale winds associated with mass-loading factors $β\!\sim\!1\!-\!50$. We have tested this prediction using a sample of 19 nearby systems with stellar masses $10^7\!&amp;amp;lt;\!M_\star/{\rm M}_{\odot}\!&amp;amp;lt;\!10^{10}$, mostly lying above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. We used MUSE@VLT optical integral field spectroscopy to study the warm ionised gas kinematics of these galaxies via a detailed modelling of their H$α$ emission line.</description>

      <description>Sergio Martin-Alvarez
Enshrouded in several well-known controversies, dwarf galaxies have been extensively studied to learn about the underlying cosmology, notwithstanding that physical processes regulating their properties are poorly understood. To shed light on these processes, we introduce the Pandora suite of 17 high-resolution (3.5 parsec half-cell side) dwarf galaxy formation cosmological simulations. Commencing with thermo-turbulent star formation and mechanical supernova feedback, we gradually increase the complexity of physics incorporated leading to full-physics models combining magnetism, on-the-fly radiative transfer and the corresponding stellar photoheating, and SN-accelerated cosmic rays.</description>

      <description>T. Miener,
One of the most pressing questions for modern physics is the nature of dark matter (DM). Several efforts have been made to model this elusive kind of matter. The largest fraction of DM cannot be made of any of the known particles of the Standard Model (SM). We focus on brane world theory as a prospective framework for DM candidates beyond the SM of particle physics. The new degrees of freedom that appear in flexible brane world models, corresponding to brane fluctuations, are called branons.</description>

      <description>K. W. Davis
We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of the Type Icn supernova (SN Icn) 2022ann, the fifth member of its newly identified class of SNe. Its early optical spectra are dominated by narrow carbon and oxygen P-Cygni features with absorption velocities of 800 km/s; slower than other SNe Icn and indicative of interaction with a dense, H/He-poor circumstellar medium (CSM) that is outflowing slower than a typical Wolf-Rayet wind velocity of $&amp;gt;$1000 km/s.</description>

A supermassive black hole (SMBH) of $\sim 3\times 10^6 , \rm M_\odot$ was recently detected via dynamical measurements at the center of the dwarf galaxy Leo I. Standing $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude above standard scaling relations, this SMBH is hosted by a galaxy devoid of gas and with no significant star formation in the last $\sim 1$ Gyr. This detection can profoundly impact the formation models for black holes and their hosts.</description>

We present novel constraints on the underlying galaxy formation physics (e.g., mass loading factor, star formation history, metal retention) at $z \gtrsim 7$ for the low-mass ($M_*\sim10^5$ M$\odot$) Local Group ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) Eridanus II (Eri II) Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we apply a one-zone chemical evolution model to Eri II&amp;rsquo;s CaHK-based photometric metallicity distribution function (MDF; [Fe/H]) and find that the evolution of Eri II is well-characterized by a short, exponentially declining star-formation history ($\tau\text{SFH} = 0.</description>

Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) offers the potential to mitigate some of the discrepancies between simulated cold dark matter (CDM) and observed galactic properties. We introduce a physically motivated SIDM model to understand the effects of self interactions on the properties of Milky Way and dwarf galaxy sized haloes. This model consists of dark matter with a nearly degenerate excited state, which allows for both elastic and inelastic scattering.</description>

Recent studies have suggested that the Milky Way (MW)&amp;rsquo;s Dark Matter (DM) halo may be significantly tilted with respect to its central stellar disk, a feature that might be linked to its formation history. In this work, we demonstrate a method of constraining the orientation of the minor axis of the DM halo using the angle and frequency variables. This method is complementary to other traditional techniques, such as orbit fitting.</description>

We study how supersonic streaming velocities of baryons relative to dark matter &amp;ndash; a large-scale effect imprinted at recombination and coherent over $\sim 3$ Mpc scales &amp;ndash; affects the formation of dwarf galaxies at $z \gtrsim 5$. We perform cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, including and excluding streaming velocities, in regions centered on halos with $M_{\rm vir}(z=0) \approx 10^{10}$ M${\odot}$; the simulations are part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project and run with FIRE-3 physics.</description>

We combine the kinematics of 159 globular clusters (GCs) provided by the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR 3) with other observational data to classify the GCs, and to estimate the mass of Milky Way (MW). We use the age-metallicity relation, integrals of motion, action space and the GC orbits to identify the GCs as either formed in-situ (Bulge and Disk) or ex-situ (via accretion). We find that $45.</description>

We examine the quenching characteristics of $328$ isolated dwarf galaxies $\left(10^{8} &amp;lt; M_{\rm star}/M_\odot &amp;lt; 10^{10} \right)$ within the \Rom{} cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. Using mock observation methods, we identify isolated dwarf galaxies with quenched star formation and make direct comparisons to the quenched fraction in the NASA Sloan Atlas (NSA). Similar to other cosmological simulations, we find a population of quenched, isolated dwarf galaxies below $M_{\rm star} &amp;lt; 10^{9} M_\odot$ not detected within the NSA.</description>

      <description>Hanneke C. Woudenberg
Stellar streams are a promising tool to study the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s dark matter subhalo population, as interactions with subhalos could produce substructure in streams. However, other possible causes for substructure first need to be well understood. Here we study the kinematics and the unusual morphology of the stellar stream Jhelum. Using a combination of ground-based photometry and Gaia EDR3 astrometry we characterize the morphology of Jhelum. We combine this new data with radial velocities from the literature to perform orbit integrations of the stream in static Galactic potentials.</description>

This satellite is detected as a resolved overdensity of stars during an ongoing search for new Local Group dwarf galaxy candidates in the UNIONS photometric dataset. It has a physical half-light radius of 26.9$^{+7.5}_{-5.4}$ pc, a $V$-band magnitude of $-$4.5 $\pm$ 0.4 mag, and resides at a heliocentric distance of approximately 100 kpc.</description>

A detailed morphological examination reveals that the accreted stellar population is mainly deposited in the outer part of dE1256, where the tidal tail is most prominent.</description>

Impulsive supernova feedback and non-standard dark matter models, such as self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), are the two main contenders for the role of the dominant core formation mechanism at the dwarf galaxy scale. Here we show that the impulsive supernova cycles that follow episodes of bursty star formation leave distinct features in the distribution function of stars: groups of stars with similar ages and metallicities develop overdense shells in phase space.</description>

Most of the clusters have stellar masses of $M_{\star}^{nsc} \lesssim 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$ and compare to Galactic globular clusters in terms of ellipticity, effective radius, stellar mass, and surface density. The clusters are modelled with a Sérsic profile and their surface brightness evaluated at the effective radius reveals a tight positive correlation to the host &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;search-hit mathjax&amp;quot;&amp;gt;galaxy&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; stellar mass.</description>

We present the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z=2-3$ in the stellar mass range of $M_\star\approx 10^{6.5}-10^{9.5}M_\odot$ using 55 dwarf galaxies in the Abell 2744 and SMACS J0723-3732 galaxy cluster fields. These dwarf galaxies are identified and confirmed by deep JWST/NIRISS imaging and slitless grism spectroscopic observations. Taking advantage of the gravitational lensing effect, we extend the previous MZR relation at $z=2-3$ to a much lower mass regime by more than 2.</description>

      <description>Georg Herzog
We examine the gas content of field dwarf galaxies in a high-resolution cosmological simulation. In agreement with previous work, we find that galaxies inhabiting dark matter haloes with mass below a critical value, $M_{200} \lesssim M_{\rm crit} \approx 5\times 10^{9} \ M_{\odot}$, are quiescent at the present day. The gas content of these galaxies is thus insensitive to feedback from evolving stars. Almost half of these quiescent systems today have gas masses much smaller than that expected for their mass.</description>
