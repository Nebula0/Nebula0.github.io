The transformation and evolution of a galaxy is strongly influenced by interactions with its environment. Neutral hydrogen (\HI) is an excellent way to trace these interactions. Here, we present \HI\ observations of the spiral galaxy NGC~895, which was previously thought to be isolated. High-sensitivity \HI\ observations from the MeerKAT large survey project MIGHTEE reveal possible interaction features, such as extended spiral arms, and the two newly discovered \HI\ companions, that drive us to change the narrative that it is an isolated galaxy.</description>

      <description>First author: Ute Lisenfeld
At the highest stellar masses (log(\mstar) $\gtrsim$ 11.5 \msun), only a small fraction of galaxies are disk-like and actively star-forming objects. These so-called `super spirals&amp;rsquo; are ideal objects to better understand how galaxy evolution proceeds and to extend our knowledge about the relation between stars and gas to a higher stellar mass regime. We present new CO(1-0) data for a sample of 46 super spirals and for 18 slightly lower-mass (log(\mstar) $&amp;gt;$ 11.</description>

      <description>First author: Shinya Wanajo
The innermost ejecta of core-collapse supernovae are considered to be the sources of some iron-group and heavier nuclei. The ejecta are predominantly driven by neutrino heating, principally due to neutrino capture on free neutrons and protons. Such neutrino interaction plays a crucial role for setting neutron richness in the ejecta. Recent hydrodynamics work with sophisticated neutrino transport indicates that the ejecta are only mildly neutron rich or even proton rich.</description>

We present an in-depth study of the late-time near-infrared plateau in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which occurs between 70-500 d. We double the existing sample of SNe Ia observed during the late-time near-infrared plateau with new observations taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, Gemini, New Technology Telescope, the 3.5m Calar Alto Telescope, and the Nordic Optical Telescope. Our sample consists of 24 nearby SNe Ia at redshift &amp;lt; 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Guan-Wen Yuan
A group of massive galaxies at redshifts of $z\geq 6.5$ have been recently detected by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which were unexpected to form at such early times within the standard Big Bang cosmology. In this work we propose that the formation of some $\sim 50~M_\odot$ primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early Universe via super-Eddington accretion within the dark matter halo can explain these observations.</description>

      <description>First author: Lin He
High-resolution X-ray observations offer a unique tool for probing the still elusive connection between galaxy mergers and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We present an analysis of nuclear X-ray emission in an optically selected sample of 92 close galaxy pairs (with projected separations $\lesssim 20$ kpc and line-of-sight velocity offsets $&amp;lt;$ 500 km s$^{-1}$) at low redshift ($\bar{z} \sim 0.07$), based on archival Chandra observations. The parent sample of galaxy pairs is constructed without imposing an optical classification of nuclear activity, thus is largely free of selection effect for or against the presence of an AGN.</description>

      <description>First author: Gerrit Schellenberger
The galaxy group NGC6338 is one of the most violent group-group mergers known to date. While the central dominant galaxies rush at each other at 1400km/s along the line of sight, with dramatic gas heating and shock fronts detected, the central gas in the BCGs remains cool. There are also indications of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and neither subcluster core has been disrupted. With our deep radio uGMRT data at 383MHz and 650MHz we clearly detect a set of large, old lobes in the southern BCG coinciding with the X-ray cavities, while the northern, and smaller BCG appears slightly extended in the radio.</description>

      <description>First author: Sylvain Veilleux
Quasar feedback may regulate the growth of supermassive black holes, quench coeval star formation, and impact galaxy morphology and the circumgalactic medium. However, direct evidence for quasar feedback in action at the epoch of peak black hole accretion at z ~ 2 remains elusive. A good case in point is the z = 1.6 quasar WISEA J100211.29+013706.7 (XID 2028) where past analyses of the same ground-based data have come to different conclusions.</description>

      <description>First author: L. Hernández-García
PBC J2333.9-2343 is a giant radio galaxy at z = 0.047 with a bright central core associated to a blazar nucleus. If the nuclear blazar jet is a new phase of the jet activity, then the small orientation angle suggest a dramatic change of the jet direction. We present observations obtained between September 2018 and January 2019 (cadence larger than three days) with Effeslberg, SMARTS-1.3m, ZTF, ATLAS, Swift, and Fermi-LAT, and between April-July 2019 (daily cadence) with SMARTS-1.</description>

      <description>First author: Dhruba Dutta Chowdhury
Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), consisting of ultralight bosons, is an intriguing alternative to Cold Dark Matter. Numerical simulations solving the Schr&amp;quot;odinger-Poisson (SP) equation, which governs FDM dynamics, show that FDM halos consist of a central solitonic core (representing the ground state of the SP equation), surrounded by a large envelope of excited states. Wave interference gives rise to order unity density fluctuations throughout the envelope and causes the soliton to undergo density oscillations and execute a confined random walk in the central region of the halo.</description>

      <description>First author: Tejpreet Kaur
The short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) have a half-life $\leq$ 100 Myr. The $\gamma$-ray observations and excess abundance of their daughter nuclides in various meteoritic phases confirm the existence of SLRs in the Galaxy and early solar system (ESS), respectively. In this work, we have developed Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models for SLRs, $^{26}$Al, and $^{60}$Fe along with $^{36}$Cl, $^{41}$Ca, and $^{53}$Mn. These models predict the temporal and spatial evolution of SLR abundance trends in the Galaxy from 2-18 kpc.</description>

      <description>First author: Michalis Kourniotis
We present a one-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic model of a spherically symmetric cloud evolving under the influence of the self-gravity and the feedback from a star cluster forming in its centre. On one hand, the model is simple due to its 1D geometry, on the other hand, the feedback includes the ionising radiation, stellar winds and the radiation pressure acting on gas and dust. The star cluster is formed from the gas flowing into the cloud centre and the feedback parameters are determined from stellar evolution models and the cluster star forming history.</description>

      <description>First author: Iñigo Sáez-Casares
In order to probe modifications of gravity at cosmological scales, one needs accurate theoretical predictions. N-body simulations are required to explore the non-linear regime of structure formation but are very time consuming. In this work, we build an emulator, dubbed e-MANTIS, that performs an accurate and fast interpolation between the predictions of a given set of cosmological simulations, in $f(R)$ modified gravity, run with ECOSMOG. We sample a wide 3D parameter space given by the current background scalar field value $10^{-7} &amp;lt; \left|f_{R_0} \right| &amp;lt; 10^{-4}$, matter density $0.</description>

We present a pedagogical review of the halo model, a flexible framework that can describe the distribution of matter and its tracers on non-linear scales for both conventional and exotic cosmological models. We start with the premise that the complex structure of the cosmic web can be described by the sum of its individual components: dark matter, gas, and galaxies, all distributed within spherical haloes with a range of masses.</description>

The Legacy e-MERLIN Multi-band Imaging of Nearby Galaxies survey (LeMMINGs) is a statistically-complete census of nuclear accretion and star formation processes in the local Universe. The LeMMINGs observations at 1.5 and 5 GHz yield angular resolutions on 10s milliarcsecond-scales, with sensitivities of 10s $\mu$Jy. Awarded 810 hours of observing time, the full statistical sample (at 1.5 GHz) plus several studies of individual objects have now been published.</description>

Low-ionization Broad Absorption Line QSOs (LoBALs) are suspected to be merging systems in which extreme, AGN-driven outflows have been triggered. Whether or not LoBALs are uniquely associated with mergers, however, has yet to be established. To characterize the morphologies of LoBALs, we present the first high-resolution morphological analysis of a volume-limited sample of 22 SDSS-selected LoBALs at 0.5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.6 from Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 observations.</description>

The conditions under which accreting neutron stars launch radio-emitting jets and/or outflows are still poorly understood. The ultracompact X-ray binary X1850--087, located in the globular cluster NGC 6712, is a persistent atoll-type X-ray source that has previously shown unusual radio continuum variability. Here we present the results of a pilot radio monitoring program of X1850--087 undertaken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, with simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous Swift/XRT data obtained at each epoch.</description>

We present optical photometric and spectroscopic studies of three supernovae (SNe) SN 2013bz, PSN J0910+5003 and ASASSN-16ex. UV-optical photometric data of ASASSN-16ex obtained with Swift-UVOT are also analyzed. These objects were initially classified as 09dc-like type Ia SNe. The decline rate parameters ($\Delta m_{15}(B){true}$) are derived as 0.92 $\pm$ 0.04 (SN 2013bz), 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05 (PSN J0910+5003) and 0.73 $\pm$ 0.03 (ASASSN-16ex).

There is no source for cosmic vorticity within the cold dark matter cosmology. However, vorticity has been observed in the universe, especially on the scales of clusters, filaments, galaxies, etc. Recent results from high-resolution general relativistic N-body simulation show that the vorticity power spectrum dominates over the power spectrum of the divergence of the peculiar velocity field on scales where the effective field theory of large-scale structure breaks down.</description>

The bulk of X-ray spectroscopic studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are focused on local ($z &amp;lt; 0.1$) sources with low-to-moderate ($&amp;lt; 0.3$) Eddington ratio ($\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$). It is then mandatory to overcome this limitation and improve our understanding of highly accreting AGN. In this work we present the preliminary results from the analysis of a sample of $\sim70$ high-$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ radio-quiet AGN at $0.06 \leq z \leq 3.</description>

Following the matching of beam sizes to 1-2 kpc for each (U)LIRG, the high-J to low-J transition-line flux ratios of each molecule and the emission line flux ratios of different molecules at each J transition are derived.</description>

We report detections of the $[OIII]$$\lambda$4364 auroral emission line for 16 galaxies at z=2.1-8.7, measured from JWST/NIRSpec observations obtained as part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey program. We combine this CEERS sample with 9 objects from the literature at z=4-9 with auroral-line detections from JWST/NIRSpec and 21 galaxies at z=1.4-3.7 with auroral-line detections from ground-based spectroscopy. We derive electron temperature T_e and direct-method oxygen abundances for the combined sample of 46 star-forming galaxies at z=1.</description>

We use the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science NIRCam parallel observations to provide a first view of the UV continuum properties of NIRCam/F444W selected galaxies at 4&amp;amp;lt;z&amp;amp;lt;7. By combining multiwavelength NIRCam observations, we constrain the UV continuum slope for a sample of 401 galaxies with stringent quality controls. We find that &amp;amp;gt;99% of the galaxies are blue star-forming galaxies with very low levels of dust (Avbeta~0.01+/-0.33). We find no statistically significant correlation for UV slope with redshift or UV magnitude.</description>

      <description>First author: Aleksandra Kusiak
Extracting the CMB blackbody temperature power spectrum &amp;ndash; which is dominated by the primary CMB signal and the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich (kSZ) effect &amp;ndash; from mm-wave sky maps requires cleaning other sky components. In this work, we develop new methods to use large-scale structure (LSS) tracers to remove cosmic infrared background (CIB) and thermal Sunyaev-Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich (tSZ) contamination in such measurements. Our methods rely on the fact that LSS tracers are correlated with the CIB and tSZ signals, but their two-point correlations with the CMB and kSZ signals vanish on small scales, thus leaving the CMB blackbody power spectrum unbiased after cleaning.</description>

We investigate how cosmic web structures affect galaxy quenching in the IllustrisTNG (TNG-100) cosmological simulations by reconstructing the cosmic web in each snapshot using the DisPerSE framework. We measure the distance from each galaxy with stellar mass log(M*/Msun)&amp;gt;=8 to the nearest node (dnode) and the nearest filament spine (dfil) and study the dependence of both median specific star formation rate () and median gas fraction () on these distances.</description>

      <description>C. Charbonnel
Unusually high N/O abundances were recently reported for a very compact, intensively star-forming object GN-z11 at z=10.6 from JWST/NIRSpec observations. We present an empirical comparison with the C, N, and O abundance ratios in Galactic globular clusters (GCs) over a large metallicity range. We show that hot hydrogen-burning nucleosynthesis within supermassive stars (SMS) formed through runaway collisions can consistently explain the observed abundances ratio in GN-z11 and in GCs.</description>

We report a $z=2.30$ galaxy protocluster (COSTCO-I) in the COSMOS field, where the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as seen in the CLAMATO IGM tomography survey does not show significant absorption. This departs from the transmission-density relationship (often dubbed the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation; FGPA) usually expected to hold at this epoch, which would lead one to predict strong Ly$\alpha$ absorption at the overdensity. For comparison, we generate mock Lyman-$\alpha$ forest maps by applying FGPA to constrained simulations of the COSMOS density field, and create mocks that incorporate the effects of finite sightline sampling, pixel noise, and Wiener filtering.</description>

We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Icn supernova (SN) 2021ckj. Spectral modeling of SN 2021ckj reveals that its composition is dominated by oxygen, carbon and iron group elements, and the photospheric velocity at peak is ~10000 km/s. From the light curve (LC) modeling applied to SNe 2021ckj, 2019hgp, and 2021csp, we find that the ejecta and CSM properties of Type Icn SNe are diverse.</description>

A joint hadronic model is shown to quantitatively explain the observations of diffuse radio emission from galaxy clusters in the form of minihalos, giant halos, relics, and their hybrid, transitional stages. Cosmic-ray diffusion of order $D\sim 10^{31\text{&amp;ndash;}32}\text{ cm}^2\text{ s}^{-1}$, inferred independently from relic energies, the spatial variability of giant-halo spectra, and the spectral evolution of relics, reproduces the observed spatio-spectral distributions, explains the recently discovered mega-halos as enhanced peripheral magnetisation, and quenches electron (re)acceleration by weak shocks or turbulence.</description>

Supermassive stars (SMS) with masses $M \gtrsim 10^3-10^4 M_{\odot}$, formed by runaway collisions in young, massive, and dense star clusters have been invoked as a possible solution to the puzzles raised by the presence of multiple stellar populations and peculiar abundance patterns observed in globular clusters. However, such objects have not been observed so far. We developed observational strategies to search for SMS hosted within young massive clusters (thought to be the precursors of globular clusters, GCs), which could be applicable in a relatively general fashion, using both photometric and spectroscopic observations.</description>

Compact objects (COs) can exist and evolve in an active galactic nuclei (AGN) disk, triggering a series of attractive CO-related multi-messenger events around a supermassive black hole. To better understand the nature of an embedded CO and its surroundings and to investigate CO-related events more accurately, in this paper, we study the specific accretion process of a CO in an AGN disk and explore the role of outflow feedback.</description>

Using recent empirical constraints on the dark matter halo&amp;ndash;galaxy&amp;ndash;supermassive black hole (SMBH) connection from $z=0-7$, we infer how undermassive, typical, and overmassive SMBHs contribute to the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at $z=6$. We find that beyond $L_\mathrm{bol} = 5 \times 10^{46}$ erg/s, the $z=6$ QLF is dominated by SMBHs that are at least 0.3 dex above the $z=6$ median $M_\bullet-M_$ relation.

The quenching of cluster satellite galaxies is inextricably linked to the suppression of their cold interstellar medium (ISM) by environmental mechanisms. While the removal of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) at large radii is well studied, how the environment impacts the remaining gas in the centres of galaxies, which are dominated by molecular gas, is less clear. Using new observations from the Virgo Environment traced in CO survey (VERTICO) and archival HI data, we study the HI and molecular gas within the optical discs of Virgo cluster galaxies on 1.</description>

Hubble constant $H_0$ and weighted amplitude of matter fluctuations $S_8$ determinations are biased to higher and lower values, respectively, in the late Universe with respect to early Universe values inferred by the Planck collaboration within flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. If these anomalies are physical, i.e. not due to systematics, they naively suggest that $H_0$ decreases and $S_8$ increases with effective redshift. Here, on the assumption that matter density parameter today $\Omega_{m}$ is a constant, we show that $S_8$ determinations from $f \sigma_8(z)$ constraints increase with effective redshift, thereby providing corroborating support for an $S_8$ discrepancy that is physical in origin.</description>

We present the first 3D hydrodynamics simulations of the excitation and propagation of internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the radiative interiors of low-mass stars on the red giant branch (RGB). We use the PPMstar explicit gas dynamics code to simulate a portion of the convective envelope and all the radiative zone down to the hydrogen-burning shell of a 1.2$M_{\odot}$ upper RGB star. We perform simulations for different grid resolutions (768$^3$, 1536$^3$ and 2880$^3$), a range of driving luminosities, and two different stratifications (corresponding to the bump luminosity and the tip of the RGB).</description>

With tantalizing evidence of the recent e-Rosita mission, re-discovering very soft X-rays and EUV radiation from a cluster of galaxies or its environment, the question of the origin of cluster EUV excess is revisited in this work. It will be shown that the gas temperature, density, and frozen-in magnetic field of the intracluster medium, collectively support the emission and propagation of coherent \u{C}erenkov radiation, which is low frequency and large amplitude radiation capable of accelerating charged particles to relativistic speeds.</description>

The fraction of ionizing photons that escape their host galaxies to ionize hydrogen in the inter-galactic medium (IGM) is a critical parameter in analyses of the reionization era. In this paper we use the Meraxes semi-analytic galaxy formation model to infer the mean ionizing photon escape fraction and its dependence on galaxy properties through joint modelling of the observed high redshift galaxy population and existing constraints on the reionization history.</description>

Our simulations include post-Newtonian terms up to the 2.5th order and are designed to reflect the environmental conditions of young (YSCs), globular (GCs), and nuclear star clusters (NSCs).</description>

Decaying or annihilating dark matter and other exotic energy injections can modify the spectrum of the universe&amp;amp;#39;s photon bath, resulting in e.g. new contributions to spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background blackbody spectrum and modifications to the temperature and ionization history of the universe. Here, we present an improved version of the $\texttt{DarkHistory}$ code, which is now capable of consistently calculating the spectrum of low-energy photons by properly treating the interactions of these photons with the levels of hydrogen atoms.</description>

We calculate the post-recombination contribution to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion due to general exotic energy injections, including dark matter (DM) decaying or annihilating to Standard Model particles. Upon subtracting the background distortion that would be present even without such energy injections, we find residual distortions that are still potentially large enough to be detectable by future experiments such as PIXIE. The distortions also have a high-energy spectral feature that is a unique signature of the injection of high-energy particles.</description>

We investigate the first emergence of the so-called cold accretion, the accretion flows deeply penetrating a halo, in the early universe with cosmological N-body/SPH simulations. We study the structure of the accretion flow and its evolution within small halos with $\lesssim 10^8~{\rm M}_\odot$ with sufficiently high spatial resolutions down to $\sim 1 \ {\rm pc}$ scale. While previous studies only follow the evolution for a short period after the primordial cloud collapse, we follow the long-term evolution until the cold accretion first appears, employing the sink particle method.</description>

The recent $\sim 4 , \sigma$ Hubble constant, $H_{0}$, tension is observed between the value of $H_{0}$ from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia). It is a decade since this tension is excruciating the modern astrophysical community. To shed light on this problem is key to consider probes at intermediate redshifts between SNe Ia and CMB and reduce the uncertainty on $H_0$.</description>

      <description>First author: Mayukh R. Gangopadhyay
We employ a machine learning (ML) algorithm to analyze cosmological background data and the linear red-shift space distortion (RSD) data in a model-independent way, with specific focus on the Hubble expansion rate and the growth of large-scale structure. We find strong evidence that the natural enhancement in the Hubble parameter at low redshifts is due to the underlying phantom nature of dark energy, rather than low matter density.</description>

      <description>First author: Fangxia An
By combining high-sensitivity LOFAR 150MHz, uGMRT 400MHz, GMRT 610MHz, and JVLA 5GHz data in the ELAIS-N1 field, we study the radio spectral properties of radio-detected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at observer-frame frequencies of 150-5000MHz. We select ~3,500 SFGs that have both LOFAR 150MHz and GMRT 610MHz detections by removing AGN from the two radio samples, and obtain a median spectral index of $\alpha_{150}^{610}=-0.51\pm0.01$ with a scatter of $\sigma=0.</description>

We use optical Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFU) to study the gas emission structure and kinematics in the inner 3.4$\times$4.9 kpc$^2$ region of the galaxy UGC 8782 (3C 293), host of a radio loud Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). The observations were performed with the GMOS-IFU on the Gemini North telescope, resulting in a spatial resolution of $\sim725$ pc at the distance of the galaxy. While the stars present ordered rotation following the orientation of the large scale disc, the gas shows a disturbed kinematics.</description>

We present results of $[CII]$$,158,\rm{\mu m}$ emission line observations, and report the spectroscopic redshift confirmation of a strongly lensed ($\mu\sim20$) star-forming galaxy, MACS0308-zD1 at $z=6.2078\pm0.0002$. The $[CII]$ emission line is detected with a signal-to-noise ratio $&amp;gt;6$ within the rest-frame UV bright clump of the lensed galaxy (zD1.1) and exhibits multiple velocity components; the narrow $[CII]$ has a velocity full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of $110\pm20,\rm{km/s}$, while broader $[CII]$ is seen with an FWHM of $230\pm20,\rm{km/s}$.</description>

Using resolved optical stellar photometry from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER) survey, we measured the star formation history (SFH) near the position of 85 supernova remnants (SNRs) in M33. We constrained the progenitor masses for 60 of these SNRs, finding the remaining 25 remnants had no local SF in the last 56 Myr consistent with core-collapse SNe (CCSNe), making them potential Type Ia candidates.</description>

In this letter, we explore the quiescent lives of central galaxies using the SAGE galaxy model and Uchuu dark matter simulation. We ask three questions: (1) How much of a galaxy&amp;rsquo;s life is spent in quiescence? (2) How often do galaxies transition off the main sequence? (3) What is the typical duration of a quiescent phase? We find low and high-mass galaxies spend the highest fraction of their lives in quiescence: 45 \pm 19% for log10(Mstar) &amp;lt; 9.</description>

SX Phoenicis (SXP) variables are short period pulsating stars that exhibit a period-luminosity (PL) relation. We derived the gri-band PL and extinction-free period-Wesenheit (PW) relations, as well as the period-color (PC) and reddening-free period-Q-index (PQ) relations for 47 SXP stars in located in 21 globular clusters using the optical light curves taken from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). These empirically relations were derived for the first time in the gri filters except for the g-band PL relation.</description>

We study varying forms of viscous dark matter and try to address the intriguing tensions of the standard model of cosmology with the recent cosmological data, including the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions. We note that assuming the dark matter viscosity depends on the Hubble parameter, dark matter density, or both, one can improve the statistics. Although the models tend to aggravate the Hubble tension a bit, they tend to reduce the $S_8$ tension, even in comparison with the constant viscosity case.</description>

      <description>Elad Steinberg
This work generalizes the discrete implicit Monte-Carlo (DIMC) method for modeling the radiative transfer equation from a gray treatment to an frequency-dependent one. The classic implicit Monte-Carlo (IMC) algorithm, that has been used for several decades, suffers from a well-known numerical problem, called teleportation, where the photons might propagate faster than the exact solution due to the finite size of the spatial and temporal resolution. The Semi-analog Monte-Carlo algorithm proposed the use of two kinds of particles, photons and material particles that are born when a photon is absorbed.</description>

      <description>Chen Zhang
It is intriguing to ask whether the existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe could significantly reduce the abundance of certain stable massive particles (SMP) via gravitational capture, after which the PBHs evaporate before BBN to avoid conflict with stringent bounds. For example, this mechanism is relevant to an alternative solution of the monopole problem proposed by Stojkovic and Freese, in which magnetic monopoles produced in the early universe are captured by PBHs, thus freeing inflation from having to occur during or after the corresponding phase transitions that produced the monopoles.</description>

By implementing a model of primordial dust emission, we predict dust-continuum fluxes for massive galaxy sources similar to those recently detected by JWST at $z \gtrsim 7$. Current upper flux limits, obtained with ALMA for some of these sources, can constrain gas metallicity and dust fraction of the first galaxies. Encouragingly, if assuming expected properties for typical first galaxies (i.e., dust-to-metal mass ratio: $D/M = 5 \times 10^{-3}$, gas metallicity: $Z_{\rm g} = 5 \times 10^{-3}~Z_{\odot}$, star formation efficiency: $\eta = 0.</description>

RAD12, the RAD@home citizen science discovery with GMRT being presented here, is not only a new system being added to nearly half a dozen rare cases known so far but also the first case where the neighbouring galaxy is not a minor or dwarf companion but a galaxy bigger than the host of the radio jet.</description>

We present six epochs of optical spectropolarimetry of the Type IIP supernova (SN) 2021yja ranging from $\sim$ 25 to 95 days after the explosion. An unusually high continuum linear polarization of $p \sim 0.9%$ is measured during the early photospheric phase, followed by a steady decrease well before the onset of the nebular phase. This behavior has not been observed before in Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP).</description>

Recent photometric observations of massive stars have identified a low-frequency power excess which appears as stochastic low-frequency variability in light curve observations. We present the oscillation properties of high resolution hydrodynamic simulations of a 25 $\mathrm{M}\odot$ star performed with the PPMStar code. The model star has a convective core mass of $\approx, 12, \mathrm{M}\odot$ and approximately half of the envelope simulated. From this simulation, we extract light curves from several directions, average them over each hemisphere, and process them as if they were real photometric observations.</description>

Ongoing MeV telescopes such as INTEGRAL/SPI and Fermi/GBM, and proposed telescopes including the recently accepted COSI and the e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO missions, provide another window in understanding transients. Their signals contain information about the stellar explosion mechanisms and their corresponding nucleosynthesis of short-lived radioactive isotopes. This raises the need of a radiative transfer code which may efficiently explore different types of astrophysical $γ$-ray sources and their dependence on model parameters and input physics.</description>

However, as the redshift of the transient object was not measured, it is possible that the measured location of the transient on the celestial sphere and the location of the local galaxy merely coincided.</description>

One of the main objectives of stage IV galaxy surveys is to constrain gravity on cosmological scales. To this end, it is crucial to make accurate theoretical predictions in the nonlinear regime of structure formation in order to maximise the scientific return. This is possible at a relatively low computational cost thanks to COLA simulations, an approximate and much faster alternative to full $N$-body simulations. In this thesis, we focus on two modified gravity theories, $f(R)$ and nDGP, and present an analysis of how COLA simulations can be combined with empirical models for the galaxy-halo connection to produce realistic mock galaxy catalogues in modified gravity.</description>

We present a spectro-photometric study of a mass-complete sample of quiescent galaxies at $1.0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 1.3$ with $\mathrm{log_{10}}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}) \geq 10.3$ drawn from the VANDELS survey, exploring the relationship between stellar mass, age and star-formation history. Within our sample of 114 galaxies, we derive a stellar-mass vs stellar-age relation with a slope of $1.20^{+0.28}{-0.27}$ Gyr per decade in stellar mass. When combined with recent literature results, we find evidence that the slope of this relation remains consistent over the redshift interval $0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4$.</description>

The source of the tension between local SN Ia based Hubble constant measurements and those from the CMB or BAO+BBN measurements is one of the most interesting unknowns of modern cosmology. Sample variance forms a key component of the error on the local measurements, and will dominate the error budget in the future as more supernovae are observed. Many methods have been proposed to estimate sample variance in many contexts, and we compared results from a number of them in Zhai &amp;amp; Percival (2022), confirming that sample variance for the Pantheon supernovae sample does not solve the Hubble tension.</description>

Mass and angular momentum are key parameters of galaxies.

Massive neutrinos and $f(R)$ modified gravity have degenerate observational signatures that can impact the interpretation of results in galaxy survey experiments, such as cosmological parameter estimations and gravity model tests. Because of this, it is important to investigate astrophysical observables that can break these degeneracies. Cosmic voids are sensitive to both massive neutrinos and modifications of gravity and provide a promising ground for disentangling the above mentioned degeneracies.</description>

We performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the inner $\approx 50%$ radial extent of a $25\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$ star in the early phase of the main sequence and investigate core convection and internal gravity waves in the core-envelope boundary region. Simulations for different grid resolutions and driving luminosities establish scaling relations to constrain models of mixing for 1D applications. As in previous works, the turbulent mass entrainment rate extrapolated to nominal heating is unrealistically high ($1.</description>

      <description>First author: Aline Chu
The formation process of fossil groups (FGs) is still under debate, and large samples of such objects are still missing. The aim of this paper is to increase the sample of known FGs, and to analyse the properties of their brightest group galaxies (BGG) and compare them with a control sample of non-FG BGGs. Based on the Tinker spectroscopic catalogue of haloes and galaxies, we extract 87 FG and 100 non-FG candidates.</description>

      <description>First author: Joon Hyeop Lee
We introduce a practical methodology for investigating the star formation and chemical evolution history of a galaxy: age-divided mean stellar populations (ADPs) from full spectrum fitting. In this method, the mass-weighted mean stellar populations and mass fractions (f_mass) of young and old stellar components in a galaxy are separately estimated, which are divided with an age cut (selected to be 10^9.5 yr ~ 3.2 Gyr in this paper).</description>

      <description>First author: Sajad Abbar
Neutrinos propagating in a dense neutrino gas, such as those expected in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs), can experience fast flavor conversions on relatively short scales. This can happen if the neutrino electron lepton number ($\nu$ELN) angular distribution crosses zero in a certain direction. Despite this, most of the state-of-the-art CCSN and NSM simulations do not provide such detailed angular information and instead, supply only a few moments of the neutrino angular distributions.</description>

      <description>First author: Patrick S. Kamieneski
Gradients in the mass-to-light ratio of distant galaxies impede our ability to characterize their size and compactness. The long-wavelength filters of $JWST$&amp;rsquo;s NIRCam offer a significant step forward. For galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim2$), this regime corresponds to the rest-frame near-infrared, which is less biased towards young stars and captures emission from the bulk of a galaxy&amp;rsquo;s stellar population. We present an initial analysis of an extraordinary lensed dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at $z=2.</description>

      <description>First author: Aldana Grichener
We suggest a common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) origin to the supernova remnant (SNR) W49B where jets launched by a neutron star (NS) that collapsed to a black hole (BH) together with a thermonuclear outburst of the disrupted red super giant&amp;rsquo;s (RGS&amp;rsquo;s) core powered and shaped the ejecta. The jets account for the highly non-spherical morphology of W49B and the thermonuclear outburst to its high iron abundance.</description>

      <description>First author: Giovanni Aricò
We present the first analysis of cosmic shear measured in DES Y3 that employs the entire range of angular scales in the data. To achieve this, we build upon recent advances in the theoretical modelling of weak lensing provided by a combination of $N$-body simulations, physical models of baryonic processes, and neural networks. Specifically, we use BACCOemu to model the linear and nonlinear matter power spectrum including baryonic physics, allowing us to robustly exploit scales smaller than those used by the DES Collaboration.</description>

      <description>First author: Ashok K. Singal
In recent years, large radio surveys of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), comprising millions of sources, have become available where one could investigate dipole asymmetries, assumedly arising due to a peculiar motion of the Solar system. Investigations of such dipoles have yielded in past much larger amplitudes (a factor of 2 to 20) than that of the CMB dipole, though their inferred directions in sky seem to lie, within statistical uncertainties, close to the CMB dipole.</description>

      <description>First author: Julius Wons
We forecast the ability of bispectrum estimators to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity using future photometric galaxy redshift surveys. A full-sky survey with photometric redshift resolution of $\sigma_z/(1+z)=0.05$ in the redshift range $0.2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;2$ can provide constraints $\sigma(f^\mathrm{local}\mathrm{NL})=3.4$, $\sigma(f^\mathrm{equil}\mathrm{NL})=15$, and $\sigma(f^\mathrm{orth}_\mathrm{NL})=17$ for the local, equilateral, and orthogonal shapes respectively, delivering constraints on primordial non-Gaussianities competitive to those from the cosmic microwave background. We generalize these results by deriving a scaling relation for the constraints on the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity as a function of redshift error, depth, sky coverage, and nonlinear scale cutoff.</description>

      <description>First author: Francesco D&amp;rsquo;Eugenio
We present the first study of spatially integrated higher-order stellar kinematics over cosmic time. We use deep rest-frame optical spectroscopy of quiescent galaxies at redshifts z=0.05, 0.3 and 0.8 from the SAMI, MAGPI and LEGA-C surveys to measure the excess kurtosis $h_4$ of the stellar velocity distribution, the latter parametrised as a Gauss-Hermite series. Conservatively using a redshift-independent cut in stellar mass ($M_\star = 10^{11},{\rm M}_\odot$), and matching the stellar-mass distributions of our samples, we find 7 $\sigma$ evidence of $h_4$ increasing with cosmic time, from a median value of 0.</description>

We numerically study the origin of the multi-armed spiral structure observed in the circumnuclear gaseous mini-disks of nearby galaxies. We show that the presence of dust in such disks and its interaction with the gravitationally stable gaseous component leads to the development of a multi-armed spiral structure. As a particular example, we study the formation of the multi-armed spiral pattern in the mini-disk of the galaxy NGC 4736, for which the observational data for the rotation and the density distribution are available.</description>

Recent high-$z$ quasar observations strongly indicate that super-Eddington accretion is a crucial phase to describe the existence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with $M_\mathrm{BH} \gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at $z \gtrsim 7$. Motivated by the theoretical suggestion that the super-Eddington phase efficiently produces outflows and jets bright in radio bands, we search and find a super-Eddington radio-loud dust-obscured galaxy (DOG) J1406+0102 at $z=0.236$, through cross-matching of the infrared-bright DOGs of Noboriguchi et al.</description>

With the advent of the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), scientists will be able to directly observe the Epoch of Reionization by mapping the distribution of neutral hydrogen at different redshifts. While physically motivated results can be simulated with radiative transfer codes, these simulations are computationally expensive and can not readily produce the required scale and resolution simultaneously. Here we introduce the Physics-Informed neural Network for reIONization (PINION), which can accurately and swiftly predict the complete 4-D hydrogen fraction evolution from the smoothed gas and mass density fields from pre-computed N-body simulation.</description>

A variety of observational campaigns seek to test dark-matter models by measuring dark-matter subhaloes at low masses. Despite their predicted lack of stars, these subhaloes may be detectable through gravitational lensing or via their gravitational perturbations on stellar streams. To set measurable expectations for subhalo populations within LambdaCDM, we examine 11 Milky Way (MW)-mass haloes from the FIRE-2 baryonic simulations, quantifying the counts and orbital fluxes for subhaloes with properties relevant to stellar stream interactions: masses down to 10^6 Msun, distances &amp;lt; 50 kpc of the galactic center, across z = 0 - 1 (lookback time 0 - 8 Gyr).</description>

Recent observations of high-redshift galactic disks ($z\approx 1-3$) show a strong negative trend in the dark matter fraction $f_{DM}$ with increasing baryonic surface density. For this to be true, the inner baryons must dominate over dark matter in early massive galaxies, as observed in the Milky Way today. If disks are dominant at early times, we show that stellar bars form promptly within these disks, leading to a high bar fraction at early times.</description>
