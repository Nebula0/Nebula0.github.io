      <description>First author: Tariq Yasin
Rotation curves are the key observational manifestation of the dark matter distribution around late-type galaxies. In a halo model context, the precision of constraints on halo parameters is a complex function of the properties of the measurements as well as properties of the galaxy itself. Forthcoming surveys will resolve rotation curves to varying degrees of precision, or measure their integrated effect in the HI linewidth. To ascertain the relative significance of the relevant quantities for constraining halo properties, we study the information on halo mass and concentration as quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the kinematics-informed posterior from the uninformative prior.</description>

      <description>First author: Suchetha Cooray
We report the discovery of a two-dimensional Galaxy Manifold within the multi-dimensional luminosity space of local galaxies. The multi-dimensional luminosity space is constructed using 11 bands that span from far ultraviolet to near-infrared for redshift &amp;lt; 0.1 galaxies observed with GALEX, SDSS, and UKIDSS. The two latent parameters are sufficient to express 93.2% of the variance in the galaxy sample, suggesting that this Galaxy Manifold is one of the most efficient representations of galaxies.</description>

      <description>First author: Danial Langeroodi
The mid-infrared spectra of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) are characterized by characteristic broad PAH emission features at 3$-$20 $\mu$m. As these features are redshifted, they are predicted to dominate the flux at specific mid-infrared wavelengths, leading to substantial redshift-dependent color variations in broad-band photometry. The advent of JWST for the first time allows the study of this effect for normal SFGs. Based on spectral energy distribution templates, we here present tracks in mid-infrared (4.</description>

Cluster galaxies exhibit substantially lower star formation rates than field galaxies today, but it is conceivable that clusters were sites of more active star formation in the early universe. Herein, we present an interpretation of the star formation history (SFH) of group/cluster galaxies based on the large-scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, Horizon-AGN. We find that massive galaxies in general have small values of e-folding timescales of star formation decay (i.</description>

      <description>First author: Rosa A. González-Lópezlira
We continue to explore the relationship between globular cluster total number, $N_{\rm GC}$, and central black hole mass, $M_\bullet$, in spiral galaxies. We present here results for the Sab galaxies NGC 3368, NGC 4736 (M 94) and NGC 4826 (M 64), and the Sm galaxy NGC 4395. The globular cluster (GC) candidate selection is based on the ($u^*$ - $i^\prime$) versus ($i^\prime$ - $K_s$) color-color diagram, and $i^\prime$-band shape parameters.</description>

      <title>Cosmological gas accretion history onto the stellar discs of Milky Way-like galaxies in the Auriga simulations -- (I) Temporal dependency</title>

      <description>First author: Federico G. Iza
We use the 30 simulations of the Auriga Project to estimate the temporal dependency of the inflow, outflow and net accretion rates onto the discs of Milky Way-like galaxies. The net accretion rates are found to be similar for all galaxies at early times, increasing rapidly up to $\sim 10~\mathrm{M}\odot , \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. After $\sim 6~\mathrm{Gyr}$ of evolution, however, the net accretion rates are diverse: in most galaxies, these exhibit an exponential-like decay, but some systems instead present increasing or approximately constant levels up to the present time.</description>

One of the most fundamental baryonic matter components of galaxies is the neutral atomic hydrogen (H$,{\rm \scriptsize I}$). At low redshifts, this component can be traced directly through the 21-cm transition, but to infer H$,{\rm \scriptsize I}$ gas content of the most distant galaxies, a viable tracer is needed. We here investigate the fidelity of the fine structure transition of the ($^2P_{3/2} - ^2P_{1/3}$) transition of singly-ionized carbon [C$,{\rm \scriptsize II}$] at $158,\mu$m as a proxy for H$,{\rm \scriptsize I}$ in a set simulated galaxies at $z\approx 6$, following the work by Heintz et al.</description>

      <title>The correlation between WISE 12 $μ$m emission and molecular gas tracers on sub-kpc scales in nearby star-forming galaxies</title>

      <description>First author: Yang Gao
We complement the MALATANG sample of dense gas in nearby galaxies with archival observations of $^{12}\rm CO$ and its isotopologues to determine scaling relations between Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) 12 $\mu$m emission and molecular gas tracers at sub-kiloparsec scales. We find that 12 $\mu$m luminosity is more tightly correlated with $^{12}\rm CO$ than it is with $^{13}\rm CO$ or dense gas tracers. Residuals between predicted and observed $^{12}\rm CO$ are only weakly correlated with molecular gas mass surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm mol}$) in regions where $\Sigma_{\rm mol}$ is very low ($\sim 10~{\rm M_{\odot}~pc^{-2}}$).</description>

We present the first clustering measurement of Strong Blended Lyman $\alpha$ (SBLA) absorption systems by measuring their cross-correlation with the Lyman $\alpha$ forest. SBLAs are a new population of absorbers detected within the Lyman $\alpha$ forest. We find a bias of $2.329\pm0.057$, consistent with that of Damped Lyman $\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs). For DLAs, we recover a bias of $2.331\pm0.057$ larger than previously reported (P&#39;erez-R`afols et al.</description>

      <description>First author: Mengyuan Xiao
Our current understanding of the cosmic star formation history at z&amp;gt;3 is primarily based on UV-selected galaxies (i.e., LBGs). Recent studies of H-dropouts revealed that we may be missing a large amount of star formation taking place in massive galaxies at z&amp;gt;3. In this work, we extend the H-dropout criterion to lower masses to select optically-dark/faint galaxies (OFGs), in order to complete the census between LBGs and H-dropouts.</description>
