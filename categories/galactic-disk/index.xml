      <title>GRB 191019A: a short gamma-ray burst in disguise from the disk of an active galactic nucleus</title>

      <description>Davide Lazzati
Long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), canonically separated at around 2 seconds duration, are associated with different progenitors: the collapse of a massive star and the merger of two compact objects, respectively. GRB 191019A was a long GRB ($T_{90}\sim64$ s). Despite the relatively small redshift z=0.248 and HST followup observations, an accompanying supernova was not detected. In addition, the host galaxy did not have significant star formation activity.</description>

We study the formation of globular clusters in massive compact clouds with the low-metallicity of $Z=10^{-3}~Z_{\odot}$ by performing three-dimensional radiative-hydrodynamics simulations. Considering the uncertainty of the initial mass function (IMF) of stars formed in low-metallicity and high-density clouds, we investigate the impacts of the IMF on the cloud condition for the GC formation with the range of the power-law index of IMF as $γ= 1-2.35$. We find that the threshold surface density ($Σ_{\rm thr}$) for the GC formation increases from $800~M_{\odot} \; {\rm pc^{-2}}$ at $γ= 2.</description>

      <description>Matthias Kluge
We present new, deep optical observations of the early-type galaxy NGC 4278, which is located in a small loose group. We find that the galaxy lacks fine substructure, i.e., it appears relaxed, out to a radius of $\sim$70 kpc. Our $g$- and $i$-band surface brightness profiles are uniform down to our deepest levels of $\sim$28 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. This spans an extremely large radial range of more than 14 half-mass radii.</description>

We report on the discovery of the companion star to the millisecond pulsar PSR J1835-3259B in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6652. Taking advantage of deep photometric archival observations acquired through the Hubble Space Telescope in near-ultraviolet and optical bands, we identified a bright and blue object at a position compatible with that of the radio pulsar. The companion is located along the helium-core white dwarf cooling sequence and the comparison with binary evolution models provides a mass of $0.</description>

      <description>Daniel R. Weisz
Using color-magnitude diagrams from deep archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we self-consistently measure the star formation history of Eridanus II (Eri II), the lowest-mass galaxy ($M_{\star}(z=0) \sim 10^5 M_{\odot}$) known to host a globular cluster (GC), and the age, mass, and metallicity of its GC. The GC ($\sim13.2\pm0.4$ Gyr, $\langle[Fe/H]\rangle = -2.75\pm0.2$ dex) and field (mean age $\sim13.5\pm0.3$ Gyr, $\langle[Fe/H]\rangle = -2.6\pm0.15$ dex) have similar ages and metallicities.</description>

Studying open clusters (OCs) is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. Many previous studies have systematically searched for OCs near the solar system within 1.2 kpc or 20 degrees of galactic latitude. However, few studies searched for OCs at higher galactic latitudes and deeper distances. In this study, based on a hybrid unsupervised clustering algorithm (Friends-of-Friends and pyUPMASK) and a binary classification algorithm (Random Forest), we extended the search region (i.</description>

      <title>The Role of Outflow Feedback on Accretion of Compact Objects in Accretion Disk of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

Compact objects (COs) can exist and evolve in an active galactic nuclei (AGN) disk, triggering a series of attractive CO-related multi-messenger events around a supermassive black hole. To better understand the nature of an embedded CO and its surroundings and to investigate CO-related events more accurately, in this paper, we study the specific accretion process of a CO in an AGN disk and explore the role of outflow feedback.</description>

As groups of coeval stars born from the same molecular cloud, an Open cluster (OC) is an ideal laboratory for studying the structure and dynamical evolution of the Milky Way. The release of High-Precision Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) and modern machine-learning methods offer unprecedented opportunities to identify OCs. In this study, we extended conventional HDBSCAN (e-HDBSCAN) for searching for new OCs in Gaia EDR3. A pipeline was developed based on the parallel computing technique to blindly search for open clusters from Gaia EDR3 within Galactic latitudes $\left| b \right|$ $&amp;amp;lt;$25 $^\circ$.</description>

      <title>The role of radial migration on tracing lithium evolution in the Galactic disk</title>

With the calculated guiding center radius $R_{guiding}$ and birth radius $R_{birth}$, we investigate the role of radial migration on the description of lithium evolution in the Galactic disk based on the upper envelope of the A(Li) vs. $[Fe/H]$ diagram. Using migration distances, we find that stars in the solar neighborhood are born at different locations in the galactic disk, and cannot all be explained by models of chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood.</description>

Stellar-mass black holes can become embedded within the gaseous disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Afterwards, their interactions are mediated by their gaseous surroundings. In this work, we study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded within AGN disks using a combination of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and analytic methods, focusing on environments in which the AGN disk scale height $H$ is [arXiv:2301.03629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03629)$\gtrsim$ the BBH sphere of influence.</description>

In galactic disks, the Parker instability results when non-thermal pressure support exceeds a certain threshold. The non-thermal pressures considered in the Parker instability are cosmic ray pressure and magnetic pressure. This instability takes a long time to saturate $(&amp;gt;500 , \mathrm{Myr})$ and assumes a background with fixed cosmic ray pressure to gas pressure ratio. In reality, galactic cosmic rays are injected into localized regions $(&amp;lt; 100 ,\mathrm{pc})$ by events like supernovae, increasing the cosmic ray pressure to gas pressure ratio.</description>

We compare 500~pc scale, resolved observations of ionised and molecular gas for the $z\sim0.02$ starbursting disk galaxy IRAS08339+6517, using measurements from KCWI and NOEMA. We explore the relationship of the star formation driven ionised gas outflows with colocated galaxy properties. We find a roughly linear relationship between the outflow mass flux ($\dotΣ_{\rm out}$) and star formation rate surface density ($Σ_{\rm SFR}$), $\dotΣ_{\rm out}\proptoΣ_{\rm SFR}^{1.06\pm0.10}$, and a strong correlation between $\dotΣ_{\rm out}$ and the gas depletion time, such that $\dotΣ_{\rm out} \propto t_{dep}^{-1.</description>

      <description>Jia Ren
We investigate the dynamics and electromagnetic (EM) signatures of neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) merger ejecta that occurs in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find that the interaction between ejecta and disk gas leads to important effects on the dynamics and radiation. We show five stages of the ejecta dynamics: gravitational slowing down, coasting, Sedov-Taylor deceleration in the disk, re-acceleration after the breakout from the disk surface, and momentum-conserved snowplow phase.</description>

We investigate the kinematic-chemical distribution of Red Giant Branch (RGB)stars from the LAMOST survey crossed matched with Gaia DR2 proper motions, and present time tagging for the well-known ridge structures (diagonal distributions for $V_R$ in the $R$, $V_φ$ plane) in the range of Galactocentric distance $R$ = 8 to 15 kpc. We detect six ridge structures, including five ridges apparent in the radial velocity distribution and three ridges apparent in the vertical velocity, the sensitive time of which to the perturbations are from young population (0$-$3 Gyr) to old population (9$-$14 Gyr).</description>

      <description>Kuantay Boshkayev
We reproduce the rotation curve of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) by taking into account its bulge, disk, and halo components, considering the last one to contain the major part of dark matter mass. Hence, our prescription is to split the galactic bulge into two components, namely, the inner and main bulges, respectively. Both bulges are thus modeled by exponential density profiles since we underline that the widely accepted de Vaucouleurs law fails to reproduce the whole galactic bulge rotation curve.</description>
