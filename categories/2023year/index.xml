Mass loss due to line-driven winds is central to our understanding of the evolution of massive stars. We extend the evolution models introduced in Paper I, where the mass loss recipe is based on the simultaneous calculation of the wind hydrodynamics and the line-acceleration, by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation. We introduce a grid of self-consistent line-force parameters for a set of standard evolutionary tracks.</description>

The vast majority of extragalactic, compact continuum radio sources are associated with star formation or jets from (super)massive black holes and, as such, are more likely to be found in association with starburst galaxies or early type galaxies. Recently, two new populations of radio sources have been identified: (a) compact and persistent sources (PRS) associated with fast radio bursts (FRB) in dwarf galaxies and (b) compact sources in dwarf galaxies that could belong to the long-sought population of intermediate-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>A long-duration gamma-ray burst of dynamical origin from the nucleus of an ancient galaxy</title>

      <description>First author: Andrew J. Levan
The majority of long duration ($&amp;gt;2$ s) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to arise from the collapse of massive stars \cite{Hjorth+03}, with a small proportion created from the merger of compact objects. Most of these systems are likely formed via standard stellar evolution pathways. However, it has long been thought that a fraction of GRBs may instead be an outcome of dynamical interactions in dense environments, channels which could also contribute significantly to the samples of compact object mergers detected as gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <description>First author: Gokul P. Srinivasaragavan
We report observations of the optical counterpart of the long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) GRB 221009A. Due to the extreme rarity of being both nearby ($z = 0.151$) and highly energetic ($E_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso}} \geq 10^{54}$ erg), GRB 221009A offers a unique opportunity to probe the connection between massive star core collapse and relativistic jet formation. Adopting a phenomenological power-law model for the afterglow and host galaxy estimates from high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we use Bayesian model comparison techniques to determine the likelihood of an associated SN contributing excess flux to the optical light curve.</description>

      <description>First author: Gopika K.
A large number of observations have shown that the dark matter halo surface density, given by the product of halo core radius and core density is nearly constant for a diverse suite of galaxies. Although this invariance of the halo surface density is violated at galaxy cluster and group scales, it is still an open question on whether the aforementioned constancy on galactic scales can be explained within $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>First author: Polychronis Papaderos
Since the k correction depends on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy, any high-z galaxy with a spatially non-homogeneous SED will experience a spatially varying relative dimming or brightening in addition to the pure distance effect. The morphology of galaxies will therefore change with z. For instance, an early spiral galaxy observed in the V band would show a prominent bulge at z=0, whereas, if at z=1, the V filter probes the rest-frame near-UV where the bulge is faint and the disk relatively brighter, thus the galaxy may appear as bulgeless.</description>

      <description>First author: Jos√© Ferreira
In this dissertation, we study two cosmological models based on $f(Q)$ gravity. We resort to mock catalogs of standard siren (SS) events to see whether data from future gravitational wave (GWs) observatories will be able to distinguish these models from $\Lambda$CDM. The first model is the most general $f(Q)$ formulation that replicates a $\Lambda$CDM background, with deviations appearing only at the perturbative level. It has one additional free parameter compared to $\Lambda$CDM, $\alpha$, which when set to zero falls back to $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>First author: C. Spingola
Current cosmological controversies can be solved if a sufficient level of precision is achieved by observations. Future surveys with the next generation of telescopes will offer significantly improved depth and angular resolution with respect to existing observations, opening the so-called &amp;ldquo;era of precision cosmology&amp;rdquo;. But, that era can be considered already started at the radio wavelengths with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In this paper, we give an overview on how VLBI is contributing to some open questions in contemporary cosmology by reaching simultaneously the largest distances and the smallest scales.</description>

      <description>First author: Yi Xu
We present demography of the dynamics and gas-mass fraction of 33 extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs) with metallicities of $0.015-0.195~Z_\odot$ and low stellar masses of $10^4-10^8~M_\odot$ in the local universe. We conduct deep optical integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) for the low-mass EMPGs with the medium high resolution ($R=7500$) grism of the 8m-Subaru FOCAS IFU instrument by the EMPRESS 3D survey, and investigate H$\alpha$ emission of the EMPGs. Exploiting the resolution high enough for the low-mass galaxies, we derive gas dynamics with the H$\alpha$ lines by the fitting of 3-dimensional disk models.</description>

The dynamics of binary stars provides a unique avenue to gather insight into the study of the structure and dynamics of star clusters and galaxies. In this paper, we present the results of a set of $N$-body simulations aimed at exploring the evolution of binary stars during the early evolutionary phases of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFD). In our simulations, we assume that the stellar component of the UFD is initially dynamically cold and evolves towards its final equilibrium after undergoing the violent relaxation phase.</description>

      <description>Davide Lazzati
Long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), canonically separated at around 2 seconds duration, are associated with different progenitors: the collapse of a massive star and the merger of two compact objects, respectively. GRB 191019A was a long GRB ($T_{90}\sim64$ s). Despite the relatively small redshift z=0.248 and HST followup observations, an accompanying supernova was not detected. In addition, the host galaxy did not have significant star formation activity.</description>

      <description>First author: Qiliang Fang
The relation between the progenitor mass and the kinetic energy of the explosion is a key toward revealing the explosion mechanism of stripped-envelope (SE) core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe). Here, we present a method to derive this relation using the nebular spectra of SESNe, based on the correlation between the $[O~I]$/$[Ca~II]$, which is an indicator of the progenitor mass, and the width of $[O~I]$, which measures the expansion velocity of the oxygen-rich material.</description>

Of these detections, 134 (80%) of the millimeter counterparts are first-time identifications with ACT. We expand the previous ACT extragalactic source catalogs, by including new 98 GHz detections and measurements from ACT DR5.</description>

      <description>First author: Ryan K. Alexander
Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are among the oldest and most metal-poor galaxies in the cosmos, observed to contain no traces of gas at the present time and a high dark matter mass fraction. Understanding the chemical abundance dispersion in such extreme environments could shed light on the properties of the first generations of stars in the cosmos. We present a novel inhomogeneous chemical evolution model, i-GEtool, that we apply to two ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, Carina II (Car II) and Reticulum II (Ret II), which are satellites of the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

Core-collapse supernova remnants are structures of the interstellar medium (ISM) left behind the explosive death of most massive stars (smaller or equal to 40 Mo). Since they result in the expansion of the supernova shock wave into the gaseous environment shaped by the star wind history, their morphology constitutes an insight into the past evolution of their progenitor star. Particularly, fast-moving massive stars can produce asymmetric core-collapse supernova remnants.</description>

      <description>First author: M. Obergaulinger
In contrast to regular core-collapse supernovae, explosions of rapidly rotating massive stars can develop jets, fast collimated outflows directed along the rotational axis. Depending on the rate of rotation and the magnetic field strength before collapse as well as on possible mechanisms amplifying the magnetic field, such a core can explode magnetorotationally rather than via the standard supernova mechanism based on neutrino heating. This scenario can explain the highest kinetic energies observed in the class of hypernovae.</description>

      <description>First author: Floor van Donkelaar
Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are massive star clusters found in the innermost region of the majority of galaxies. While recent studies suggest that low-mass NSCs in dwarf galaxies form largely out of the merger of globular clusters and NSCs in massive galaxies have assembled most of their mass through central star formation, the formation channel of the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s NSC is still uncertain. In this work, we use GigaEris, a very high resolution $N$-body hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in&#39;&#39; simulation, to investigate NSC formation in the progenitor of a Milky Way-sized galaxy, as well as its relation to the assembly and evolution of the galactic nuclear region.</description>

We study the formation of globular clusters in massive compact clouds with the low-metallicity of $Z=10^{-3}~Z_{\odot}$ by performing three-dimensional radiative-hydrodynamics simulations. Considering the uncertainty of the initial mass function (IMF) of stars formed in low-metallicity and high-density clouds, we investigate the impacts of the IMF on the cloud condition for the GC formation with the range of the power-law index of IMF as $Œ≥= 1-2.35$. We find that the threshold surface density ($Œ£_{\rm thr}$) for the GC formation increases from $800~M_{\odot} \; {\rm pc^{-2}}$ at $Œ≥= 2.</description>

Without AGN feedback, simulated massive, star-forming galaxies become too compact relative to observed galaxies at z&amp;lt;2. In this paper, we perform high-resolution re-simulations of a massive (M*~10^11M_sol) galaxy at z~2, drawn from the FIRE project. In the simulation without AGN feedback, the galaxy experiences a rapid starburst and shrinking of its half-mass radius at z~2.3. In this paper, we experiment with driving mechanical AGN winds using a state-of-the-art hyper-Lagrangian refinement technique to increase particle resolution.</description>

Direct collapse of supermassive stars is a possible pathway to form supermassive black hole seeds at high redshifts. Whereas previous three-dimensional (3D) simulations demonstrate that supermassive stars form via rapid mass accretion, those resolving the stellar interior have been limited. We here report 3D radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations following the evolution of rapidly accreting protostars resolving the stellar interior. We use an adaptive mesh refinement code with our newly developed RHD solver employing an explicit M1 closure method.</description>

We apply the full set of most update dynamical and geometrical data in cosmology to the nonextensive Barrow entropic holographic dark energy. We show that the data point towards an extensive Gibbs-like entropic behaviour for the cosmological horizons, which is the extreme case of the Barrow entropy, with the entropy parameter being $\Delta &amp;gt; 0.86$, close to the maximum threshold of $\Delta =1$ where the fractal dimension of the area-horizon becomes almost or just the volume and the intensivity is recovered.</description>

We present the Cardinal mock galaxy catalogs, a new version of the Buzzard simulation that has been updated to support ongoing and future cosmological surveys, including DES, DESI, and LSST. These catalogs are based on a one-quarter sky simulation populated with galaxies out to a redshift of $z=2.35$ to a depth of $m_{\rm{r}}=27$. Compared to the Buzzard mocks, the Cardinal mocks include an updated subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) model that considers orphan galaxies and includes mass-dependent scatter between galaxy luminosity and halo properties.</description>

Interpretation of resolved polarized images of black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) requires predictions of the polarized emission observable by an Earth-based instrument for a particular model of the black hole accretion system. Such predictions are generated by general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) codes, which integrate the equations of polarized radiative transfer in curved spacetime. A selection of ray-tracing GRRT codes used within the EHT collaboration is evaluated for accuracy and consistency in producing a selection of test images, demonstrating that the various methods and implementations of radiative transfer calculations are highly consistent.</description>

Semi-numerical simulations are the leading candidates for evolving reionization on cosmological scales. These semi-numerical models are efficient in generating large-scale maps of the 21cm signal, but they are too slow to enable inference at the field level. We present different strategies to train a U-Net to accelerate these simulations. We derive the ionization field directly from the initial density field without using the ionizing sources&amp;rsquo; location, and hence emulating the radiative transfer process.</description>

Stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs offer a distinct dynamical channel to produce black hole mergers detected in gravitational waves by LIGO/Virgo. To understand their orbital evolution through interactions with the disc gas, we perform a suite of 2D high-resolution, local shearing box, viscous hydrodynamical simulations of equal-mass binaries. We find that viscosity not only smooths the flow structure around prograde circular binaries, but also greatly raises their accretion rates.</description>

We performed a detailed broadband spectral and timing analysis of a small flaring event of ~120 ks in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 using simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations. The ~300 ks long NuSTAR observation and the overlapping XMM-Newton exposure were segregated into pre-flare, flare, and post-flare segments. During the flare, the NuSTAR count rate peaked at 2.5 times the mean count rate before the flare.</description>

The repeating FRB 20121102A was localized to a star-forming region in a dwarf galaxy and found to be co-located with a persistent radio source (PRS). FRB 20190520B is only the second known source sharing phenomenology akin to FRB 20121102A&amp;rsquo;s, with similar burst activity, host galaxy properties, as well as being associated with a PRS. PRS emission is potentially a calorimeter, allowing us to estimate the energy output of the central FRB engine.</description>

The velocity-integrated $[OIII]$ emission has three peaks which are likely associated with three young stellar clumps of MACS0416_Y1, while the channel map shows a complicated velocity structure with little indication of a global velocity gradient unlike what was found in $[CII]$ 158 $\mu$m at a larger scale, suggesting random bulk motion of ionized gas clouds inside the galaxy.</description>

Using both the recent GOODS-ALMA survey as well as the full suite of ALMA Band-6 ancillary data in the GOODS-S field, we report the tentative detection of dust continuum equivalent of dust mass log($M_{dust}$/$M_{\odot}$) = 7.</description>

Radio activity in AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) produce feedback on the host galaxy via the impact of the relativistic jets on the circumnuclear gas. Although radio jets can reach up to several times the optical radius of the host galaxy, in this review we focus on the observation of the feedback deposited locally in the central region of the host galaxies, in the form of outflows due to the jet-gas interaction.</description>

Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can self-annihilate and thus provide us with the possibility for an indirect detection of Dark Matter (DM). Dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are excellent places to search for annihilation signals because they are rich in DM and background emission is low. If magnetic fields in dSph exist, the particles produced in DM annihilation emit synchrotron radiation. We use the non-detection of 150 MHz radio continuum emission from dSph galaxies with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to derive constraints on the annihilation cross-section of WIMPs into electron-positron pairs.</description>

We study the co-evolution of dark matter halos, galaxies and supermassive black holes using an empirical galaxy evolution model from $z=0$ &amp;ndash; $10$. We demonstrate that by connecting dark matter structure evolution with simple empirical prescriptions for baryonic processes, we are able to faithfully reproduce key observations in the relation between galaxies and their supermassive black holes. By assuming a physically-motivated, direct relationship between the galaxy and supermassive black hole properties to the mass of their host halo, we construct expressions for the galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy UV luminosity function, active black hole mass function and quasar bolometric luminosity function.</description>

The sample consists of 48 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts z=2.7-6.3 which are largely representative of typical star-forming galaxies at these redshifts. The $[SII]$ 6718, 6733 doublet is used to estimate electron densities (n_e), and dust-corrected Ha luminosities are used to compute total ionizing photon rates (Q).</description>

We present new, deep optical observations of the early-type galaxy NGC 4278, which is located in a small loose group. We find that the galaxy lacks fine substructure, i.e., it appears relaxed, out to a radius of $\sim$70 kpc. Our $g$- and $i$-band surface brightness profiles are uniform down to our deepest levels of $\sim$28 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. This spans an extremely large radial range of more than 14 half-mass radii.</description>

We report on the discovery of the companion star to the millisecond pulsar PSR J1835-3259B in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6652. Taking advantage of deep photometric archival observations acquired through the Hubble Space Telescope in near-ultraviolet and optical bands, we identified a bright and blue object at a position compatible with that of the radio pulsar. The companion is located along the helium-core white dwarf cooling sequence and the comparison with binary evolution models provides a mass of $0.</description>

Using observations of MACS0417-z5PSB with a JWST/NIRSpec Prism spectrum and NIRCam imaging, we investigate the mechanism responsible for the cessation of star formation of the galaxy, and speculate about possibilities for its future.</description>

Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are a class of compact, jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) whose jet axes are not aligned close to the line of sight, and whose observed emission is not predominantly relativistically boosted towards us. Using complete samples of CSOs, we present three independent lines of evidence, based on their relative numbers, their redshift distributions, and their size distributions, which show conclusively that most CSOs do not evolve into larger-scale radio sources.</description>

We investigate the mass-metallicity relationship of star forming galaxies by analysing the absorption line spectra of $\sim$200,000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The galaxy spectra are stacked in bins of stellar mass and a population synthesis technique is applied yielding metallicities, ages and star formation history of the young and old stellar population together with interstellar reddening and extinction. We adopt different lengths of the initial starbursts and different initial mass functions for the calculation of model spectra of the single stellar populations contributing to the total integrated spectrum.</description>

The GC ($\sim13.2\pm0.4$ Gyr, $\langle[Fe/H]\rangle = -2.75\pm0.2$ dex) and field (mean age $\sim13.5\pm0.3$ Gyr, $\langle[Fe/H]\rangle = -2.6\pm0.15$ dex) have similar ages and metallicities.</description>

Aims: We provide new insights into the gamma-ray emission from HESS J1912+101, a TeV supernova remnant candidate probably associated with the radio pulsar PSR J1913+1011. Methods: We obtained new observations at 1.5 GHz using the VLA in the D configuration, with the purpose of detecting the radio shell of the putative remnant. In addition, we observed a single pointing at 6.0 GHz toward PSR J1913+1011 to look for a radio pulsar wind nebula.</description>

      <description>First author: Richard J. Parker
The abundance of the short-lived radioisotopes 26-Al and 60-Fe in the early Solar system is usually explained by the Sun either forming from pre-enriched material, or the Sun&amp;rsquo;s protosolar disc being polluted by a nearby supernova explosion from a massive star. Both hypotheses suffer from significant drawbacks: the former does not account for the dynamical evolution of star-forming regions, while in the latter the time for massive stars to explode as supernovae can be similar to, or even longer than, the lifetime of protoplanetary discs.</description>

As well as the galaxy number density and peculiar velocity, the galaxy intrinsic alignment can be used to test the cosmic isotropy. We study distinctive impacts of the isotropy breaking on the configuration-space two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) composed of the spin-2 galaxy ellipticity field. For this purpose, we build a methodology to efficiently compute general types of the isotropy-violating 2PCFs by generalizing the polypolar spherical harmonic decomposition approach to the spin-weighted version.</description>

      <description>First author: C. Buttitta
We investigate the link between the bar rotation rate and dark matter content in barred galaxies by concentrating on the cases of the lenticular galaxies NGC4264 and NGC4277. These two gas-poor galaxies have similar morphologies, sizes, and luminosities. But, NGC4264 hosts a fast bar, which extends to nearly the corotation, while the bar embedded in NGC4277 is slow and falls short of corotation. We derive the fraction of dark matter $f_{\rm DM, bar}$ within the bar region from Jeans axisymmetric dynamical models by matching the stellar kinematics obtained with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph and using SDSS images to recover the stellar mass distribution.</description>

According to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, present-day massive galaxies should contain a sizable fraction of dark matter within their stellar body. Models indicate that in massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) with $M_\star\approx1.5\times10^{11},{\rm M}\odot$ dark matter should account for $\sim60%$ of the dynamical mass within five effective radii ($5,R{\rm e}$). Most massive ETGs have been shaped through a two-phase process: the rapid growth of a compact core was followed by the accretion of an extended envelope through mergers.</description>

      <description>First author: Shantanu Desai
Lorentz invariance is one of the fundamental tenets of Special Relativity, and has been extensively tested with laboratory and astrophysical observations. However, many quantum gravity models and theories beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics predict a violation of Lorentz invariance at energies close to Planck scale. This article reviews observational and experimental tests of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) with photons, neutrinos and gravitational waves. Most astrophysical tests of LIV using photons are based on searching for a correlation of the spectral lag data with redshift and energy.</description>

The {\it Linear Point} (LP), defined as the midpoint between the BAO peak and the associated left dip of the two-point correlation function (2PCF), $\xi(s)$, is proposed as a new standard ruler which is insensitive to nonlinear effects. In this paper, we use a Bayesian sampler to measure the LP and estimate the corresponding statistical uncertainty, and then perform cosmological parameter constraints with LP measurements. Using the Patchy mock catalogues, we find that the measured LPs are consistent with theoretical predictions at 0.</description>

Third-generation (3G) gravitational wave detectors, in particular Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE), will explore unprecedented cosmic volumes in search for compact binary mergers, providing us with tens of thousands of detections per year. In this study, we simulate and employ binary black holes detected by 3G interferometers as dark sirens, to extract and infer cosmological parameters by cross-matching gravitational wave data with electromagnetic information retrieved from a simulated galaxy catalog.</description>

Studying open clusters (OCs) is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. Many previous studies have systematically searched for OCs near the solar system within 1.2 kpc or 20 degrees of galactic latitude. However, few studies searched for OCs at higher galactic latitudes and deeper distances. In this study, based on a hybrid unsupervised clustering algorithm (Friends-of-Friends and pyUPMASK) and a binary classification algorithm (Random Forest), we extended the search region (i.</description>

With the aim of improving our knowledge about their nature, we conduct a comparative study on a sample of long-rising Type II supernovae (SNe) resembling SN 1987A. To do so, we deduce various scaling relations from different analytic models of H-rich SNe, discussing their robustness and feasibility. Then we use the best relations in terms of accuracy to infer the SN progenitor&amp;rsquo;s physical properties at the explosion for the selected sample of SN 1987A-like objects, deriving energies of $\sim 0.</description>

We use $z=1$ mock galaxy catalogues produced with the semi-analytic code GALACTICUS to study the dependence of the non-Gaussian bias parameter $b_\phi$ on the mass assembly history of the host halos. We generate large sets of merger trees and measure the non-Gaussian assembly bias $\Delta b_\phi$ for galaxies selected by color magnitude and emission line luminosities. For galaxies selected by $g-r$ color, we find a large assembly bias consistent with the analysis of Barreira et al.</description>

Broadband photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) have been investigated for AGNs in recent years, but mostly on accretion disk continuum RM. Due to the small fraction of broad emission lines in the broadband, PRM for emission lines is very challenging. Here we present an ICCF-Cut method for broadband PRM to obtain the H$\alpha$ broad line lag and apply it to four Seyfert 1 galaxies, MCG+08-11-011, NGC 2617, 3C 120 and NGC 5548.</description>

Supermassive stars are Population III stars with masses exceeding $10^4,M_{\odot}$ that could be the progenitors of the first supermassive black holes. Their interiors are in a regime where radiation pressure dominates the equation of state. In this work, we use the explicit gas dynamics code PPMstar to simulate the hydrogen-burning core of a $10^4,M_{\odot}$ supermassive main-sequence star. These are the first 3D hydrodynamics simulations of core convection in supermassive stars.</description>

Context: To study the effects of environment on galaxies we use HI observations of galaxies in and around the cluster A2626. The cluster can effectively be divided in three different environments: the cluster itself, a group environment in the periphery of the cluster (we call it the Swarm) and substructure in the cluster itself. We use these to study the dependence of galaxy properties on environment.</description>

      <description>First author: Julia Stadler
Cosmology inference of galaxy clustering at the field level with the EFT likelihood in principle allows for extracting all non-Gaussian information from quasi-linear scales, while robustly marginalizing over any astrophysical uncertainties. A pipeline in this spirit is implemented in the \texttt{LEFTfield} code, which we extend in this work to describe the clustering of galaxies in redshift space. Our main additions are: the computation of the velocity field in the LPT gravity model, the fully nonlinear displacement of the evolved, biased density field to redshift space, and a systematic expansion of velocity bias.</description>

We present the discovery of the most distant, dynamically relaxed cool core cluster, SPT-CL J2215-3537 (SPT2215) and its central brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) at z=1.16. Using new X-ray observations, we demonstrate that SPT2215 harbors a strong cool core, with a central cooling time of 200 Myr (at 10 kpc) and a maximal intracluster medium cooling rate of 1900+/-400 Msun/yr. This prodigious cooling may be responsible for fueling extended, star-forming filaments observed in Hubble Space Telescope imaging.</description>

Distant protoclusters of galaxies, as the progenitors of massive galaxy clusters in the present day, are expected to host brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) at their early formation stage. It remains unclear whether the assembly of (some) BCGs is essential to the formation of a mature cluster core or vice versa. Here we report the detection of a pair of massive quiescent galaxies likely in the process of merging at the centre of the spectroscopically confirmed, extremely massive protocluster BOSS1244 at a look-back time of 10.</description>

Apart from the well-known flat $\Lambda$CDM model as well as other models that have been broadly studied, this project includes two new models, which are the $\textit{o}\textit{w}$CDM model and the $\textit{o}\textit{w}0\textit{w}a$CDM model, to fully evaluate the correlations between the cosmological parameters by performing the MCMC algorithm and to explore the geometry and mass content of the Universe.</description>

The transformation and evolution of a galaxy is strongly influenced by interactions with its environment. Neutral hydrogen (\HI) is an excellent way to trace these interactions. Here, we present \HI\ observations of the spiral galaxy NGC~895, which was previously thought to be isolated. High-sensitivity \HI\ observations from the MeerKAT large survey project MIGHTEE reveal possible interaction features, such as extended spiral arms, and the two newly discovered \HI\ companions, that drive us to change the narrative that it is an isolated galaxy.</description>

At the highest stellar masses (log(\mstar) $\gtrsim$ 11.5 \msun), only a small fraction of galaxies are disk-like and actively star-forming objects. These so-called `super spirals&amp;rsquo; are ideal objects to better understand how galaxy evolution proceeds and to extend our knowledge about the relation between stars and gas to a higher stellar mass regime. We present new CO(1-0) data for a sample of 46 super spirals and for 18 slightly lower-mass (log(\mstar) $&amp;gt;$ 11.</description>

The innermost ejecta of core-collapse supernovae are considered to be the sources of some iron-group and heavier nuclei. The ejecta are predominantly driven by neutrino heating, principally due to neutrino capture on free neutrons and protons. Such neutrino interaction plays a crucial role for setting neutron richness in the ejecta. Recent hydrodynamics work with sophisticated neutrino transport indicates that the ejecta are only mildly neutron rich or even proton rich.</description>

A group of massive galaxies at redshifts of $z\geq 6.5$ have been recently detected by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which were unexpected to form at such early times within the standard Big Bang cosmology. In this work we propose that the formation of some $\sim 50~M_\odot$ primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early Universe via super-Eddington accretion within the dark matter halo can explain these observations.</description>

High-resolution X-ray observations offer a unique tool for probing the still elusive connection between galaxy mergers and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We present an analysis of nuclear X-ray emission in an optically selected sample of 92 close galaxy pairs (with projected separations $\lesssim 20$ kpc and line-of-sight velocity offsets $&amp;lt;$ 500 km s$^{-1}$) at low redshift ($\bar{z} \sim 0.07$), based on archival Chandra observations. The parent sample of galaxy pairs is constructed without imposing an optical classification of nuclear activity, thus is largely free of selection effect for or against the presence of an AGN.</description>

The galaxy group NGC6338 is one of the most violent group-group mergers known to date. While the central dominant galaxies rush at each other at 1400km/s along the line of sight, with dramatic gas heating and shock fronts detected, the central gas in the BCGs remains cool. There are also indications of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and neither subcluster core has been disrupted. With our deep radio uGMRT data at 383MHz and 650MHz we clearly detect a set of large, old lobes in the southern BCG coinciding with the X-ray cavities, while the northern, and smaller BCG appears slightly extended in the radio.</description>

      <description>First author: Sylvain Veilleux
Quasar feedback may regulate the growth of supermassive black holes, quench coeval star formation, and impact galaxy morphology and the circumgalactic medium. However, direct evidence for quasar feedback in action at the epoch of peak black hole accretion at z ~ 2 remains elusive. A good case in point is the z = 1.6 quasar WISEA J100211.29+013706.7 (XID 2028) where past analyses of the same ground-based data have come to different conclusions.</description>

      <description>First author: L. Hern√°ndez-Garc√≠a
PBC J2333.9-2343 is a giant radio galaxy at z = 0.047 with a bright central core associated to a blazar nucleus. If the nuclear blazar jet is a new phase of the jet activity, then the small orientation angle suggest a dramatic change of the jet direction. We present observations obtained between September 2018 and January 2019 (cadence larger than three days) with Effeslberg, SMARTS-1.3m, ZTF, ATLAS, Swift, and Fermi-LAT, and between April-July 2019 (daily cadence) with SMARTS-1.</description>

      <description>First author: Dhruba Dutta Chowdhury
Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), consisting of ultralight bosons, is an intriguing alternative to Cold Dark Matter. Numerical simulations solving the Schr&amp;quot;odinger-Poisson (SP) equation, which governs FDM dynamics, show that FDM halos consist of a central solitonic core (representing the ground state of the SP equation), surrounded by a large envelope of excited states. Wave interference gives rise to order unity density fluctuations throughout the envelope and causes the soliton to undergo density oscillations and execute a confined random walk in the central region of the halo.</description>

The short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) have a half-life $\leq$ 100 Myr. The $\gamma$-ray observations and excess abundance of their daughter nuclides in various meteoritic phases confirm the existence of SLRs in the Galaxy and early solar system (ESS), respectively. In this work, we have developed Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models for SLRs, $^{26}$Al, and $^{60}$Fe along with $^{36}$Cl, $^{41}$Ca, and $^{53}$Mn. These models predict the temporal and spatial evolution of SLR abundance trends in the Galaxy from 2-18 kpc.</description>

We present a one-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic model of a spherically symmetric cloud evolving under the influence of the self-gravity and the feedback from a star cluster forming in its centre. On one hand, the model is simple due to its 1D geometry, on the other hand, the feedback includes the ionising radiation, stellar winds and the radiation pressure acting on gas and dust. The star cluster is formed from the gas flowing into the cloud centre and the feedback parameters are determined from stellar evolution models and the cluster star forming history.</description>

In order to probe modifications of gravity at cosmological scales, one needs accurate theoretical predictions. N-body simulations are required to explore the non-linear regime of structure formation but are very time consuming. In this work, we build an emulator, dubbed e-MANTIS, that performs an accurate and fast interpolation between the predictions of a given set of cosmological simulations, in $f(R)$ modified gravity, run with ECOSMOG. We sample a wide 3D parameter space given by the current background scalar field value $10^{-7} &amp;lt; \left|f_{R_0} \right| &amp;lt; 10^{-4}$, matter density $0.</description>

We present a pedagogical review of the halo model, a flexible framework that can describe the distribution of matter and its tracers on non-linear scales for both conventional and exotic cosmological models. We start with the premise that the complex structure of the cosmic web can be described by the sum of its individual components: dark matter, gas, and galaxies, all distributed within spherical haloes with a range of masses.</description>

Low-ionization Broad Absorption Line QSOs (LoBALs) are suspected to be merging systems in which extreme, AGN-driven outflows have been triggered. Whether or not LoBALs are uniquely associated with mergers, however, has yet to be established. To characterize the morphologies of LoBALs, we present the first high-resolution morphological analysis of a volume-limited sample of 22 SDSS-selected LoBALs at 0.5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.6 from Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 observations.</description>

The conditions under which accreting neutron stars launch radio-emitting jets and/or outflows are still poorly understood. The ultracompact X-ray binary X1850--087, located in the globular cluster NGC 6712, is a persistent atoll-type X-ray source that has previously shown unusual radio continuum variability. Here we present the results of a pilot radio monitoring program of X1850--087 undertaken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, with simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous Swift/XRT data obtained at each epoch.</description>

We present optical photometric and spectroscopic studies of three supernovae (SNe) SN 2013bz, PSN J0910+5003 and ASASSN-16ex. UV-optical photometric data of ASASSN-16ex obtained with Swift-UVOT are also analyzed. These objects were initially classified as 09dc-like type Ia SNe. The decline rate parameters ($\Delta m_{15}(B){true}$) are derived as 0.92 $\pm$ 0.04 (SN 2013bz), 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05 (PSN J0910+5003) and 0.73 $\pm$ 0.03 (ASASSN-16ex).

There is no source for cosmic vorticity within the cold dark matter cosmology. However, vorticity has been observed in the universe, especially on the scales of clusters, filaments, galaxies, etc. Recent results from high-resolution general relativistic N-body simulation show that the vorticity power spectrum dominates over the power spectrum of the divergence of the peculiar velocity field on scales where the effective field theory of large-scale structure breaks down.</description>

The bulk of X-ray spectroscopic studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are focused on local ($z &amp;lt; 0.1$) sources with low-to-moderate ($&amp;lt; 0.3$) Eddington ratio ($\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$). It is then mandatory to overcome this limitation and improve our understanding of highly accreting AGN. In this work we present the preliminary results from the analysis of a sample of $\sim70$ high-$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ radio-quiet AGN at $0.06 \leq z \leq 3.</description>

Following the matching of beam sizes to 1-2 kpc for each (U)LIRG, the high-J to low-J transition-line flux ratios of each molecule and the emission line flux ratios of different molecules at each J transition are derived.</description>

We use the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science NIRCam parallel observations to provide a first view of the UV continuum properties of NIRCam/F444W selected galaxies at 4&amp;amp;lt;z&amp;amp;lt;7. By combining multiwavelength NIRCam observations, we constrain the UV continuum slope for a sample of 401 galaxies with stringent quality controls. We find that &amp;amp;gt;99% of the galaxies are blue star-forming galaxies with very low levels of dust (Avbeta~0.01+/-0.33). We find no statistically significant correlation for UV slope with redshift or UV magnitude.</description>

Extracting the CMB blackbody temperature power spectrum &amp;ndash; which is dominated by the primary CMB signal and the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich (kSZ) effect &amp;ndash; from mm-wave sky maps requires cleaning other sky components. In this work, we develop new methods to use large-scale structure (LSS) tracers to remove cosmic infrared background (CIB) and thermal Sunyaev-Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich (tSZ) contamination in such measurements. Our methods rely on the fact that LSS tracers are correlated with the CIB and tSZ signals, but their two-point correlations with the CMB and kSZ signals vanish on small scales, thus leaving the CMB blackbody power spectrum unbiased after cleaning.</description>

Unusually high N/O abundances were recently reported for a very compact, intensively star-forming object GN-z11 at z=10.6 from JWST/NIRSpec observations. We present an empirical comparison with the C, N, and O abundance ratios in Galactic globular clusters (GCs) over a large metallicity range. We show that hot hydrogen-burning nucleosynthesis within supermassive stars (SMS) formed through runaway collisions can consistently explain the observed abundances ratio in GN-z11 and in GCs.</description>

We report a $z=2.30$ galaxy protocluster (COSTCO-I) in the COSMOS field, where the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as seen in the CLAMATO IGM tomography survey does not show significant absorption. This departs from the transmission-density relationship (often dubbed the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation; FGPA) usually expected to hold at this epoch, which would lead one to predict strong Ly$\alpha$ absorption at the overdensity. For comparison, we generate mock Lyman-$\alpha$ forest maps by applying FGPA to constrained simulations of the COSMOS density field, and create mocks that incorporate the effects of finite sightline sampling, pixel noise, and Wiener filtering.</description>

Spectral modeling of SN 2021ckj reveals that its composition is dominated by oxygen, carbon and iron group elements, and the photospheric velocity at peak is ~10000 km/s. From the light curve (LC) modeling applied to SNe 2021ckj, 2019hgp, and 2021csp, we find that the ejecta and CSM properties of Type Icn SNe are diverse.</description>

A joint hadronic model is shown to quantitatively explain the observations of diffuse radio emission from galaxy clusters in the form of minihalos, giant halos, relics, and their hybrid, transitional stages. Cosmic-ray diffusion of order $D\sim 10^{31\text{&amp;ndash;}32}\text{ cm}^2\text{ s}^{-1}$, inferred independently from relic energies, the spatial variability of giant-halo spectra, and the spectral evolution of relics, reproduces the observed spatio-spectral distributions, explains the recently discovered mega-halos as enhanced peripheral magnetisation, and quenches electron (re)acceleration by weak shocks or turbulence.</description>

Supermassive stars (SMS) with masses $M \gtrsim 10^3-10^4 M_{\odot}$, formed by runaway collisions in young, massive, and dense star clusters have been invoked as a possible solution to the puzzles raised by the presence of multiple stellar populations and peculiar abundance patterns observed in globular clusters. However, such objects have not been observed so far. We developed observational strategies to search for SMS hosted within young massive clusters (thought to be the precursors of globular clusters, GCs), which could be applicable in a relatively general fashion, using both photometric and spectroscopic observations.</description>

Compact objects (COs) can exist and evolve in an active galactic nuclei (AGN) disk, triggering a series of attractive CO-related multi-messenger events around a supermassive black hole. To better understand the nature of an embedded CO and its surroundings and to investigate CO-related events more accurately, in this paper, we study the specific accretion process of a CO in an AGN disk and explore the role of outflow feedback.</description>

Using recent empirical constraints on the dark matter halo&amp;ndash;galaxy&amp;ndash;supermassive black hole (SMBH) connection from $z=0-7$, we infer how undermassive, typical, and overmassive SMBHs contribute to the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at $z=6$. We find that beyond $L_\mathrm{bol} = 5 \times 10^{46}$ erg/s, the $z=6$ QLF is dominated by SMBHs that are at least 0.3 dex above the $z=6$ median $M_\bullet-M_$ relation. The QLF is dominated by typical SMBHs (i.</description>

      <description>First author: Adam B. Watts
The quenching of cluster satellite galaxies is inextricably linked to the suppression of their cold interstellar medium (ISM) by environmental mechanisms. While the removal of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) at large radii is well studied, how the environment impacts the remaining gas in the centres of galaxies, which are dominated by molecular gas, is less clear. Using new observations from the Virgo Environment traced in CO survey (VERTICO) and archival HI data, we study the HI and molecular gas within the optical discs of Virgo cluster galaxies on 1.</description>

      <description>First author: Shahnawaz A. Adil
Hubble constant $H_0$ and weighted amplitude of matter fluctuations $S_8$ determinations are biased to higher and lower values, respectively, in the late Universe with respect to early Universe values inferred by the Planck collaboration within flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. If these anomalies are physical, i.e. not due to systematics, they naively suggest that $H_0$ decreases and $S_8$ increases with effective redshift. Here, on the assumption that matter density parameter today $\Omega_{m}$ is a constant, we show that $S_8$ determinations from $f \sigma_8(z)$ constraints increase with effective redshift, thereby providing corroborating support for an $S_8$ discrepancy that is physical in origin.</description>

We present the first 3D hydrodynamics simulations of the excitation and propagation of internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the radiative interiors of low-mass stars on the red giant branch (RGB). We use the PPMstar explicit gas dynamics code to simulate a portion of the convective envelope and all the radiative zone down to the hydrogen-burning shell of a 1.2$M_{\odot}$ upper RGB star. We perform simulations for different grid resolutions (768$^3$, 1536$^3$ and 2880$^3$), a range of driving luminosities, and two different stratifications (corresponding to the bump luminosity and the tip of the RGB).</description>

With tantalizing evidence of the recent e-Rosita mission, re-discovering very soft X-rays and EUV radiation from a cluster of galaxies or its environment, the question of the origin of cluster EUV excess is revisited in this work. It will be shown that the gas temperature, density, and frozen-in magnetic field of the intracluster medium, collectively support the emission and propagation of coherent \u{C}erenkov radiation, which is low frequency and large amplitude radiation capable of accelerating charged particles to relativistic speeds.</description>

The fraction of ionizing photons that escape their host galaxies to ionize hydrogen in the inter-galactic medium (IGM) is a critical parameter in analyses of the reionization era. In this paper we use the Meraxes semi-analytic galaxy formation model to infer the mean ionizing photon escape fraction and its dependence on galaxy properties through joint modelling of the observed high redshift galaxy population and existing constraints on the reionization history.</description>

Eccentric mergers are a signature of the dynamical formation channel of binary black holes (BBHs) in dense stellar environments and hierarchical triple systems. Here, we investigate the production of eccentric mergers via binary-single interactions, by means of $2.5\times10^{5}$ direct $\textit{N}$-body simulations. Our simulations include post-Newtonian terms up to the 2.5th order and are designed to reflect the environmental conditions of young (YSCs), globular (GCs), and nuclear star clusters (NSCs).</description>

      <description>Hongwan Liu,
Decaying or annihilating dark matter and other exotic energy injections can modify the spectrum of the universe&amp;amp;#39;s photon bath, resulting in e.g. new contributions to spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background blackbody spectrum and modifications to the temperature and ionization history of the universe. Here, we present an improved version of the $\texttt{DarkHistory}$ code, which is now capable of consistently calculating the spectrum of low-energy photons by properly treating the interactions of these photons with the levels of hydrogen atoms.</description>

      <description>Hongwan Liu
We calculate the post-recombination contribution to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion due to general exotic energy injections, including dark matter (DM) decaying or annihilating to Standard Model particles. Upon subtracting the background distortion that would be present even without such energy injections, we find residual distortions that are still potentially large enough to be detectable by future experiments such as PIXIE. The distortions also have a high-energy spectral feature that is a unique signature of the injection of high-energy particles.</description>

We investigate the first emergence of the so-called cold accretion, the accretion flows deeply penetrating a halo, in the early universe with cosmological N-body/SPH simulations. We study the structure of the accretion flow and its evolution within small halos with $\lesssim 10^8~{\rm M}_\odot$ with sufficiently high spatial resolutions down to $\sim 1 \ {\rm pc}$ scale. While previous studies only follow the evolution for a short period after the primordial cloud collapse, we follow the long-term evolution until the cold accretion first appears, employing the sink particle method.</description>

The recent $\sim 4 , \sigma$ Hubble constant, $H_{0}$, tension is observed between the value of $H_{0}$ from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia). It is a decade since this tension is excruciating the modern astrophysical community. To shed light on this problem is key to consider probes at intermediate redshifts between SNe Ia and CMB and reduce the uncertainty on $H_0$.</description>

We use JWST NIRCam observations from 1.5 to 4.44 micron of the massive lensing cluster field A2744 to show that extreme red selected galaxies (f(F444W) &amp;gt; 1 uJy and f(F444W)/f(F150W) &amp;gt; 3.5) pick out all 9 &amp;gt;4.5-sigma ALMA 1.1 or 1.2 mm sources and 17 of the 19 &amp;gt;5-sigma SCUBA-2 850 micron sources in the covered areas. Next, we use the red selected galaxies as priors to probe deeper in the SCUBA-2 850 micron image, identifying a sample of 44 &amp;gt;3-sigma SCUBA-2 850 micron sources with accurate positions, photometric redshifts, and magnifications.</description>

We employ a machine learning (ML) algorithm to analyze cosmological background data and the linear red-shift space distortion (RSD) data in a model-independent way, with specific focus on the Hubble expansion rate and the growth of large-scale structure. We find strong evidence that the natural enhancement in the Hubble parameter at low redshifts is due to the underlying phantom nature of dark energy, rather than low matter density.</description>

By combining high-sensitivity LOFAR 150MHz, uGMRT 400MHz, GMRT 610MHz, and JVLA 5GHz data in the ELAIS-N1 field, we study the radio spectral properties of radio-detected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at observer-frame frequencies of 150-5000MHz. We select ~3,500 SFGs that have both LOFAR 150MHz and GMRT 610MHz detections by removing AGN from the two radio samples, and obtain a median spectral index of $\alpha_{150}^{610}=-0.51\pm0.01$ with a scatter of $\sigma=0.</description>

In this letter, we explore the quiescent lives of central galaxies using the SAGE galaxy model and Uchuu dark matter simulation.

(3) What is the typical duration of a quiescent phase? We find low and high-mass galaxies spend the highest fraction of their lives in quiescence: 45 \pm 19% for log10(Mstar) &amp;lt; 9.</description>

These empirically relations were derived for the first time in the gri filters except for the g-band PL relation.</description>

We study varying forms of viscous dark matter and try to address the intriguing tensions of the standard model of cosmology with the recent cosmological data, including the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions. We note that assuming the dark matter viscosity depends on the Hubble parameter, dark matter density, or both, one can improve the statistics. Although the models tend to aggravate the Hubble tension a bit, they tend to reduce the $S_8$ tension, even in comparison with the constant viscosity case.</description>

This work generalizes the discrete implicit Monte-Carlo (DIMC) method for modeling the radiative transfer equation from a gray treatment to an frequency-dependent one. The classic implicit Monte-Carlo (IMC) algorithm, that has been used for several decades, suffers from a well-known numerical problem, called teleportation, where the photons might propagate faster than the exact solution due to the finite size of the spatial and temporal resolution. The Semi-analog Monte-Carlo algorithm proposed the use of two kinds of particles, photons and material particles that are born when a photon is absorbed.</description>

It is intriguing to ask whether the existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe could significantly reduce the abundance of certain stable massive particles (SMP) via gravitational capture, after which the PBHs evaporate before BBN to avoid conflict with stringent bounds. For example, this mechanism is relevant to an alternative solution of the monopole problem proposed by Stojkovic and Freese, in which magnetic monopoles produced in the early universe are captured by PBHs, thus freeing inflation from having to occur during or after the corresponding phase transitions that produced the monopoles.</description>

By implementing a model of primordial dust emission, we predict dust-continuum fluxes for massive galaxy sources similar to those recently detected by JWST at $z \gtrsim 7$. Current upper flux limits, obtained with ALMA for some of these sources, can constrain gas metallicity and dust fraction of the first galaxies. Encouragingly, if assuming expected properties for typical first galaxies (i.e., dust-to-metal mass ratio: $D/M = 5 \times 10^{-3}$, gas metallicity: $Z_{\rm g} = 5 \times 10^{-3}~Z_{\odot}$, star formation efficiency: $\eta = 0.</description>

Minkowski&amp;rsquo;s Object and &amp;lsquo;Death Star galaxy&amp;rsquo; are two of the famous cases of rare instances when a radio jet has been observed to directly hit a neighbouring galaxy. RAD12, the RAD@home citizen science discovery with GMRT being presented here, is not only a new system being added to nearly half a dozen rare cases known so far but also the first case where the neighbouring galaxy is not a minor or dwarf companion but a galaxy bigger than the host of the radio jet.</description>

We present six epochs of optical spectropolarimetry of the Type IIP supernova (SN) 2021yja ranging from $\sim$ 25 to 95 days after the explosion. An unusually high continuum linear polarization of $p \sim 0.9%$ is measured during the early photospheric phase, followed by a steady decrease well before the onset of the nebular phase. This behavior has not been observed before in Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP).</description>

Recent photometric observations of massive stars have identified a low-frequency power excess which appears as stochastic low-frequency variability in light curve observations. We present the oscillation properties of high resolution hydrodynamic simulations of a 25 $\mathrm{M}\odot$ star performed with the PPMStar code. The model star has a convective core mass of $\approx, 12, \mathrm{M}\odot$ and approximately half of the envelope simulated. From this simulation, we extract light curves from several directions, average them over each hemisphere, and process them as if they were real photometric observations.</description>

Ongoing MeV telescopes such as INTEGRAL/SPI and Fermi/GBM, and proposed telescopes including the recently accepted COSI and the e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO missions, provide another window in understanding transients. Their signals contain information about the stellar explosion mechanisms and their corresponding nucleosynthesis of short-lived radioactive isotopes. This raises the need of a radiative transfer code which may efficiently explore different types of astrophysical $Œ≥$-ray sources and their dependence on model parameters and input physics.</description>

Images of 10 galaxies in F814W and F606W filters obtained on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) are used to construct color-magnitude diagrams for the star population of these galaxies. The distances to the galaxies are estimated from the luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch. The galaxies examined here have radial velocities from 250 to 760 km/s relative to the centroid of the Local Group and distances ranging from 3.</description>

Context. Recent observations of GRB 200415A, a short and very bright pulse of $\gamma$-rays, have been claimed to be an extragalactic magnetar giant flare (MGF) whose proposed host galaxy is the nearby ${\mathrm{NGC} , 253}$. However, as the redshift of the transient object was not measured, it is possible that the measured location of the transient on the celestial sphere and the location of the local galaxy merely coincided.</description>

      <description>First author: Bartolomeo Fiorini
One of the main objectives of stage IV galaxy surveys is to constrain gravity on cosmological scales. To this end, it is crucial to make accurate theoretical predictions in the nonlinear regime of structure formation in order to maximise the scientific return. This is possible at a relatively low computational cost thanks to COLA simulations, an approximate and much faster alternative to full $N$-body simulations. In this thesis, we focus on two modified gravity theories, $f(R)$ and nDGP, and present an analysis of how COLA simulations can be combined with empirical models for the galaxy-halo connection to produce realistic mock galaxy catalogues in modified gravity.</description>

We present a spectro-photometric study of a mass-complete sample of quiescent galaxies at $1.0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 1.3$ with $\mathrm{log_{10}}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}) \geq 10.3$ drawn from the VANDELS survey, exploring the relationship between stellar mass, age and star-formation history. Within our sample of 114 galaxies, we derive a stellar-mass vs stellar-age relation with a slope of $1.20^{+0.28}{-0.27}$ Gyr per decade in stellar mass. When combined with recent literature results, we find evidence that the slope of this relation remains consistent over the redshift interval $0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;4$.</description>

The source of the tension between local SN Ia based Hubble constant measurements and those from the CMB or BAO+BBN measurements is one of the most interesting unknowns of modern cosmology. Sample variance forms a key component of the error on the local measurements, and will dominate the error budget in the future as more supernovae are observed. Many methods have been proposed to estimate sample variance in many contexts, and we compared results from a number of them in Zhai &amp;amp; Percival (2022), confirming that sample variance for the Pantheon supernovae sample does not solve the Hubble tension.</description>

Massive neutrinos and $f(R)$ modified gravity have degenerate observational signatures that can impact the interpretation of results in galaxy survey experiments, such as cosmological parameter estimations and gravity model tests. Because of this, it is important to investigate astrophysical observables that can break these degeneracies. Cosmic voids are sensitive to both massive neutrinos and modifications of gravity and provide a promising ground for disentangling the above mentioned degeneracies.</description>

Simulations for different grid resolutions and driving luminosities establish scaling relations to constrain models of mixing for 1D applications. As in previous works, the turbulent mass entrainment rate extrapolated to nominal heating is unrealistically high ($1.</description>

Based on the Tinker spectroscopic catalogue of haloes and galaxies, we extract 87 FG and 100 non-FG candidates.</description>

Neutrinos propagating in a dense neutrino gas, such as those expected in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs), can experience fast flavor conversions on relatively short scales. This can happen if the neutrino electron lepton number ($\nu$ELN) angular distribution crosses zero in a certain direction. Despite this, most of the state-of-the-art CCSN and NSM simulations do not provide such detailed angular information and instead, supply only a few moments of the neutrino angular distributions.</description>

Gradients in the mass-to-light ratio of distant galaxies impede our ability to characterize their size and compactness. The long-wavelength filters of $JWST$&amp;rsquo;s NIRCam offer a significant step forward. For galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim2$), this regime corresponds to the rest-frame near-infrared, which is less biased towards young stars and captures emission from the bulk of a galaxy&amp;rsquo;s stellar population. We present an initial analysis of an extraordinary lensed dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at $z=2.</description>

We present the first analysis of cosmic shear measured in DES Y3 that employs the entire range of angular scales in the data. To achieve this, we build upon recent advances in the theoretical modelling of weak lensing provided by a combination of $N$-body simulations, physical models of baryonic processes, and neural networks. Specifically, we use BACCOemu to model the linear and nonlinear matter power spectrum including baryonic physics, allowing us to robustly exploit scales smaller than those used by the DES Collaboration.</description>

In recent years, large radio surveys of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), comprising millions of sources, have become available where one could investigate dipole asymmetries, assumedly arising due to a peculiar motion of the Solar system. Investigations of such dipoles have yielded in past much larger amplitudes (a factor of 2 to 20) than that of the CMB dipole, though their inferred directions in sky seem to lie, within statistical uncertainties, close to the CMB dipole.</description>

A full-sky survey with photometric redshift resolution of $\sigma_z/(1+z)=0.05$ in the redshift range $0.2&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;2$ can provide constraints $\sigma(f^\mathrm{local}\mathrm{NL})=3.4$, $\sigma(f^\mathrm{equil}\mathrm{NL})=15$, and $\sigma(f^\mathrm{orth}_\mathrm{NL})=17$ for the local, equilateral, and orthogonal shapes respectively, delivering constraints on primordial non-Gaussianities competitive to those from the cosmic microwave background. We generalize these results by deriving a scaling relation for the constraints on the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity as a function of redshift error, depth, sky coverage, and nonlinear scale cutoff.</description>

We present the first study of spatially integrated higher-order stellar kinematics over cosmic time. We use deep rest-frame optical spectroscopy of quiescent galaxies at redshifts z=0.05, 0.3 and 0.8 from the SAMI, MAGPI and LEGA-C surveys to measure the excess kurtosis $h_4$ of the stellar velocity distribution, the latter parametrised as a Gauss-Hermite series. Conservatively using a redshift-independent cut in stellar mass ($M_\star = 10^{11},{\rm M}_\odot$), and matching the stellar-mass distributions of our samples, we find 7 $\sigma$ evidence of $h_4$ increasing with cosmic time, from a median value of 0.</description>

We numerically study the origin of the multi-armed spiral structure observed in the circumnuclear gaseous mini-disks of nearby galaxies. We show that the presence of dust in such disks and its interaction with the gravitationally stable gaseous component leads to the development of a multi-armed spiral structure. As a particular example, we study the formation of the multi-armed spiral pattern in the mini-disk of the galaxy NGC 4736, for which the observational data for the rotation and the density distribution are available.</description>

Recent high-$z$ quasar observations strongly indicate that super-Eddington accretion is a crucial phase to describe the existence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with $M_\mathrm{BH} \gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at $z \gtrsim 7$. Motivated by the theoretical suggestion that the super-Eddington phase efficiently produces outflows and jets bright in radio bands, we search and find a super-Eddington radio-loud dust-obscured galaxy (DOG) J1406+0102 at $z=0.236$, through cross-matching of the infrared-bright DOGs of Noboriguchi et al.</description>

      <description>Damien Korber
With the advent of the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), scientists will be able to directly observe the Epoch of Reionization by mapping the distribution of neutral hydrogen at different redshifts. While physically motivated results can be simulated with radiative transfer codes, these simulations are computationally expensive and can not readily produce the required scale and resolution simultaneously. Here we introduce the Physics-Informed neural Network for reIONization (PINION), which can accurately and swiftly predict the complete 4-D hydrogen fraction evolution from the smoothed gas and mass density fields from pre-computed N-body simulation.</description>

A variety of observational campaigns seek to test dark-matter models by measuring dark-matter subhaloes at low masses. Despite their predicted lack of stars, these subhaloes may be detectable through gravitational lensing or via their gravitational perturbations on stellar streams. To set measurable expectations for subhalo populations within LambdaCDM, we examine 11 Milky Way (MW)-mass haloes from the FIRE-2 baryonic simulations, quantifying the counts and orbital fluxes for subhaloes with properties relevant to stellar stream interactions: masses down to 10^6 Msun, distances &amp;lt; 50 kpc of the galactic center, across z = 0 - 1 (lookback time 0 - 8 Gyr).</description>

The progenitor system of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is expected to be a close binary system of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf (WD) and a non-degenerate star or another WD. Here, we present results from a high-cadence monitoring observation of SN 2021hpr in a spiral galaxy, NGC 3147, and constraints on the progenitor system based on its early multi-color light curve data. First, we classify SN 2021hpr as a normal SN Ia from its long-term photometric and spectroscopic data.</description>

We use both an axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric galactic potentials, which include the rotating elongated bar/bulge structure. We account for observational errors both in the positions and in the velocities of the globular clusters and explore the influence of the bar on cluster&amp;amp;#39;s evolution.</description>

Recent observations of high-redshift galactic disks ($z\approx 1-3$) show a strong negative trend in the dark matter fraction $f_{DM}$ with increasing baryonic surface density. For this to be true, the inner baryons must dominate over dark matter in early massive galaxies, as observed in the Milky Way today. If disks are dominant at early times, we show that stellar bars form promptly within these disks, leading to a high bar fraction at early times.</description>

We report a peculiar variable blue star in the globular cluster NGC 6397, using Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging. Its position in the colour-magnitude diagrams, and its spectrum, are consistent with this star being a helium core white dwarf (He WD) in a binary system. The optical light curve shows a periodicity at 18.5 hours. We argue that this periodicity is due to the rotation of the WD and possibly due to magnetic spots on the surface of the WD.</description>

In a sample of 9 nearby galaxies ranging from ultra-luminous infrared galaxies to normal spiral galaxies, we measure a remarkably constant CN/HCN line intensity ratio of 0.</description>

The cosmological inflow of a galaxy is speculated to be able to enter the galaxy and enhance the star formation rate (SFR) and black hole accretion rate (BHAR). In this paper, by performing high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations in the framework of {\it MACER}, we investigate the fate of the inflow and its impacts on the evolution of a massive elliptical galaxy. The inflow properties are adopted from the cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG.</description>

The first JWST spectroscopy of the luminous galaxy GN-z11 simultaneously both established its redshift at $z=10.6$ and revealed a rest-ultraviolet spectrum dominated by signatures of highly-ionized nitrogen, which has so far defied clear interpretation. Here we present a reappraisal of this spectrum in the context of both detailed nebular modeling and nearby metal-poor reference galaxies. The N IV] emission enables the first nebular density measurement in a star-forming galaxy at $z&amp;amp;gt;10$, and reveals evidence for extremely high densities $n_e\gtrsim 10^5$ $\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.</description>

Primordial gravitational waves are one of the most important predictions of inflation theory, and measurements of their imprints on the cosmic microwave background are actively pursued, but not yet succeed until now. Here we point out that measurements of primordial gravitational waves could be conceivable through searching for a signal of second-order tensor perturbations, which were produced due to nonlinear couplings between the linear tensor and scalar perturbations in the early universe.</description>

      <description>Mark Gieles
Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can be retained in globular clusters (GCs) until the present. Simulations of GC evolution find that the relaxation driven mass-loss rate is elevated if BHs are present, especially near dissolution. We capture this behaviour in a parameterised mass-loss rate, benchmarked by results from $N$-body simulations, and use it to evolve an initial GC mass function (GCMF), similar to that of young massive clusters in the Local Universe, to an age of 12 Gyr.</description>

In this work, we study the applications of entropy bounds in two toy cosmological models with particle production (annihilation), i.e., radiation-dominated universe and dust-dominated universe. Since entropy bounds are involved in the volume of the thermodynamc system, we need to specify the thermodynamc system in the universe in advance. We consider the co-moving volume and the volume covered by the particle horizon as the target thermodynamic system.</description>

Positron annihilation line at 511~keV is a known component of the gamma-ray diffuse emission. It is believed to be produced in the Galaxy, but there could be possible extragalactic contribution as well. E.g., positrons can be produced in jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and after that accumulate and gradually annihilate in hot gaseous halos around galaxies. In this work we test this hypothesis in application to an individual object &amp;ndash; the Andromeda galaxy (M31) which is close and has a supermassive black hole in its center, which powered an AGN before.</description>

Core-collapse supernovae are a promising potential high-energy neutrino source class. We test for correlation between seven years of IceCube neutrino data and a catalog containing more than 1000 core-collapse supernovae of types IIn and IIP and a sample of stripped-envelope supernovae. We search both for neutrino emission from individual supernovae, and for combined emission from the whole supernova sample through a stacking analysis. No significant spatial or temporal correlation of neutrinos with the cataloged supernovae was found.</description>

We derive average ages and elemental abundances in four bins of stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) ranging from 150$~$km$,$s$^{-1}$ to 250$~$km$,$s$^{-1}$ using a full-spectrum hierarchical Bayesian model.

The enhanced activity typical of the core of Seyfert galaxies can drive powerful winds where high-energy phenomena can occur. In spite of their high power content, the number of such non-jetted active galactic nuclei detected in gamma-ray is very limited. In this Letter, we report the detection of a gamma-ray flux from NGC 4151, a Seyfert galaxy located at about 15.8 Mpc. The source is known for hosting ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) in its innermost core through X-ray spectroscopic observations, thereby becoming the first UFO host ever detected in gamma rays.</description>

      <description>Patrick Chi-Kit Cheong
We present the implementation of two-moment based general-relativistic multi-group radiation transport module in the $\texttt{G}$eneral-relativistic $\texttt{mu}$ltigrid $\texttt{nu}$merical ($\texttt{Gmunu}$) code. On top of solving the general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and the Einstein equations with conformally flat approximations, the code solves the evolution equations of the zeroth- and first-order moments of the radiations. Analytic closure relation is used to obtain the higher order moments and close the system. The finite-volume discretisation has been adopted for the radiation moments.</description>

Interactions between galaxies leave distinguishable imprints in the form of tidal features which hold important clues about their mass assembly. Unfortunately, these structures are difficult to detect because they are low surface brightness features so deep observations are needed. Upcoming surveys promise several orders of magnitude increase in depth and sky coverage, for which automated methods for tidal feature detection will become mandatory. We test the ability of a convolutional neural network to reproduce human visual classifications for tidal detections.</description>

The presence of delayed GeV emission after a strong transient, such as a GRB (Gamma-Ray Burst), in the VHE (Very-High Energy, $E&amp;gt;100$ GeV) band can be the signature of a non-zero magnetic field in the intergalactic medium. We used a synchrotron self-Compton multiwavelength model to infer an analytical description of the intrinsic VHE spectrum (corrected for absorption by the Extragalactic Background Light, EBL) of GRB$,$190114C to predict the lightcurves and SEDs of the delayed emission with Monte Carlo simulations for different IGMF (Intergalactic Magnetic Field) configurations (strengths $B=8\times10^{-21}$ G, $10^{-20}$ G, $3\times 10^{-20}$G and correlation length $\lambda&amp;gt;1$ Mpc), and compared them with the Fermi-LAT (Fermi Large Area Telescope) limits computed for several exposure times.</description>

Dark matter clusters on all scales, therefore it is expected that even substructure should host its own substructure. Using the Extragalactic Distance Database, we searched for dwarf galaxy satellites of dwarf galaxies, i.e. satellite-of-satellite galaxies, corresponding to these substructures-of-substructure. Going through HST data of 117 dwarf galaxies, we report the discovery of a dwarf galaxy around the ultra-diffuse M96 companion M96-DF6 at 10 Mpc. Modelling its structural parameters, we find that it is an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy which is 135 times fainter than its host.</description>

We develop a new method to determine the distance between a galaxy and a foreground screen of atomic hydrogen. In a partially neutral universe, and under the assumption of spherical symmetry, this equates to the radius of a ionized &amp;lsquo;bubble&amp;rsquo; (Rbub) surrounding the galaxy. The method requires an observed Lya equivalent width, velocity offset from systemic, and an input Lya profile for which we adopt scaled versions of the profiles observed in low-z galaxies.</description>

The massive galaxy cluster El Gordo ($z=0.87$) imprints multitudes of gravitationally lensed arcs onto James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) images. Eight bands of NIRCam imaging were obtained in the Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science (PEARLS) program (GTO #1176). PSF-matched photometry across a suite of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and NIRCam filters gives new photometric redshifts. We confirm 54 known image multiplicities and find two new ones and construct a lens model based on the light-traces-mass method.</description>

The first population of X-ray binaries (XRBs) is expected to affect the thermal and ionization states of the gas in the early Universe. Although these X-ray sources are predicted to have important implications for high-redshift observable signals, such as the hydrogen 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn and the cosmic X-ray background, their properties are poorly explored, leaving theoretical models largely uninformed. In this paper we model a population of X-ray binaries arising from zero metallicity stars.</description>

The nature of Type Ia supernovae remains controversial. The youngest remnants of Ia supernovae hold clues to the explosion and to the immediate surroundings. We present a third epoch of Chandra observations of the $\sim600$-year-old Type Ia remnant 0519-69.0 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, extending the time baseline to 21 years from the initial 2000 observations. We find rapid expansion of X-ray emitting material, with an average velocity of 4760 km s$^{-1}$.</description>

Galaxy spins are believed to retain initially acquired tendency of being aligned with the intermediate principal axes of the linear tidal field, which disseminates a prospect of using them as a probe of the early universe physics. This roseate prospect, however, is contingent upon the key assumption that the observable stellar spins of the present galaxies measured at inner radii have the same alignment tendency toward the initial tidal field as their dark matter counterparts measured at virial limits.</description>

When discovered, SN~2017egm was the closest (redshift $z=0.03$) hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) and a rare case that exploded in a massive and metal-rich galaxy. Thus, it has since been extensively observed and studied. We report spectroscopic data showing strong emission at around He~I $\lambda$10,830 and four He~I absorption lines in the optical. Consequently, we classify SN~2017egm as a member of an emerging population of helium-rich SLSNe-I (i.</description>

The large scale limit of the galaxy power spectrum provides a unique window into the early Universe through a possible detection of scale dependent bias produced by Primordial Non Gaussianities. On such large scales, relativistic effects could become important and, potentially, be confused for a primordial signal. In this work we provide the first consistent estimate of such effects in the observed galaxy power spectrum, and discuss their possible degeneracy with local Primordial Non Gaussianities.</description>

While the vast majority of Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) has been identified by wide-field sky surveys in the optical and X-ray bands, recent studies indicate that a considerable fraction of TDEs may be dust obscured, and thus preferentially detected in the infrared (IR) wavebands. In this Letter, we present the discovery of a luminous mid-IR nuclear flare (termed WTP 14adbjsh) identified in a systematic transient search of archival images from the NEOWISE mid-IR survey.</description>

Studies of the three-dimensional (3D) structures of galactic magnetic fields are now entering a new era, with broadband, highly sensitive radio observations and new analysis methods. To reveal the magnetic field configuration from the observed value integrated along the line of sight, it is necessary to derive an appropriate model that can reproduce the observational characteristics. We aim to clarify the relationship between the radiation field and the spatial distribution of physical quantities through pseudo-observations using global 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation results.</description>

With a timing baseline of $\sim$3.5 yr we are able to measure the derivative of the spin frequency ($\dotŒΩ$) for the first five pulsars. Upper limits on the pulsar line-of-sight acceleration are estimated and compared with predictions based on analytical models of the cluster.</description>

The Fanaroff-Riley class II radio galaxy Cygnus A hosts jets which produce radio emission, X-ray cavities, cocoon shocks, and X-ray hotspots where the jet interacts with the ICM. Surrounding one hotspot is a peculiar &amp;ldquo;hole&amp;rdquo; feature which appears as a deficit in X-ray emission. We use relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of a collimated jet interacting with an inclined interface between lobe and cluster plasma to model the basic processes which may lead to such a feature.</description>

Cyanamide (NH2CN) and its isomer, carbodiimide (HNCNH), may form adenine in the interstellar medium (ISM) via a series of reactions. Therefore, they are considered key prebiotic molecules in the study of the origin of life. We used the three-phase NAUTILUS chemical code, which includes the gas, the dust surface, and the icy mantle, to investigate the formation and destruction of cyanamide and carbodiimide. We added over 200 new chemical reactions of the two isomers and related species, and established a relatively complete network.</description>

For this purpose, we utilized a collection of the 9 relaxed galaxy clusters within the X-COP compilation in the redshift range of $z \le 0.1$. We implement the formalism assuming an NFW mass profile for the dark matter density and study the degeneracy present between the mass $\M$ and the chameleon coupling with a high degree of improvement in the constraints for excluded parameter space.</description>

We investigate the properties of mergers that are comparable to the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies. It was previously shown that these mergers occur over a wide range of times ($6-10,$Gyr ago). We find that the merger progenitors span an order of magnitude in their peak stellar mass ($3\times10^8&amp;lt;M_{\star}/\rm{M}{\odot}&amp;lt;4\times10^9$) and include both rotation and pressure-supported galaxies ($0.10&amp;lt;D/T&amp;lt;0.77$). In a minority of cases, the GSE-like debris is comprised of stars from more than one merger progenitor.</description>

Globular clusters (GCs) are found in all types of galaxies and harbor some of the most extreme stellar systems, including black holes that may dynamically assemble into merging binaries (BBHs). Despite their ubiquity, the origin and evolution of GCs remains an open question. Uncertain GC properties, including when they formed, their initial masses and sizes, affect their production rate of BBH mergers. Using the gravitational-wave catalog GWTC-3, we measure that dynamically-assembled BBHs -- those that are consistent with isotropic spin directions -- make up $61^{+29}_{-44}\%$ of the total merger rate, with a local merger rate of $10.</description>

A macroscopic and kinetic relativistic description for a decoupled multi-fluid cosmology endowed with gravitationally induced particle production of all components is proposed. The temperature law for each decoupled particle species is also kinetically derived. The present approach points to the possibility of an exact (semi-classical) quantum-gravitational kinetic treatment by incorporating back reaction effects for an arbitrary set of dominant decoupled components. As an illustration we show that a cosmology driven by creation of cold dark matter and baryons (without dark energy) evolves like $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>First author: Angelos Nersesian
We present a nonparametric morphology analysis of the stellar continuum and nebular emission lines for a sample of local galaxies. We explore the dependence of the various morphological parameters on wavelength and morphological type. Our goal is to quantify the difference in morphology between the stellar and nebular components. We derive the nonparametric morphological indicators of 364 galaxies from the CALIFA Survey. To calculate those indicators, we apply the StatMorph package on the high-quality integral field spectroscopic data cubes, as well as to the most prominent nebular emission-line maps, namely $[OIII]$$\lambda$5007, H$\alpha$, and $[NII]$$\lambda$6583.</description>

Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are X-ray flares with a duration ranging from a few hundred seconds to a few hours. Possible origins include the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate-mass black hole, a supernova shock breakout, and a binary neutron star merger. We present the X-ray light curve and spectrum, and deep optical imaging of the FXT XRT 210423, which has been suggested to be powered by a magnetar produced in a binary neutron star merger.</description>

      <description>Andrew J. Winter
Globular clusters exhibit abundance variations, defining `multiple populations&amp;amp;#39;, which have prompted a protracted search for their origin. Properties requiring explanation include: the high fraction of polluted stars ($\sim 40{-}90$~percent, correlated with cluster mass), the absence of pollution in young clusters and the lower pollution rate with binarity and distance from the cluster centre. We present a novel mechanism for late delivery of pollutants into stars via accretion of sub-stellar companions.</description>

We study accretion disk-corona connection in Seyfert 1 galaxies using simultaneous UV/X-ray observations of NGC 4593 (July 14-18, 2016) and NGC 7469 (October 15-19, 2017) performed with AstroSat. We use the X-ray (0.5-7.0 keV) data acquired with the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) and the UV (FUV: 130-180 nm, NUV: 200-300 nm) data obtained with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT). We also use the contemporaneous Swift observations of NGC 4593 and demonstrate AstroSat&amp;rsquo;s capability for X-ray/UV correlation studies.</description>

We present the first systematic study of the detailed shapes of the line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs) in nine massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) using the novel non-parametric modelling code WINGFIT. High-signal spectral observations with MUSE at the VLT allow us to measure between 40 and 400 individual LOSVDs in each galaxy at a signal-to-noise level better than 100 per spectral bin and to trace the LOSVDs all the way out to the highest stellar velocities.</description>

We combine the superior JWST/NIRCam imaging and MUSE data to characterize the properties of galaxies in different environmental conditions in the cluster Abell2744 (z=0.3064) and in its immediate surroundings. Our most striking result is the discovery of a ``red-excess&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; population in F200W-F444W colors both in the cluster regions and the field. These galaxies have normal F115W-F150W colors, but are up to 0.8 mag redder than red sequence galaxies in F200W-F444W.</description>

      <description>First author: Z. N. Osmanov
In the paper we study the process of excitation of Langmuir waves in the magnetospheres of active galactic nuclei (AGN), by taking a general-relativistic expression of the Goldreich-Julian density into account. We considered the linearised set of equations which describe dynamics of the studied mechanism: the Euler equation, the continuity equation and the Poisson equation. After solving the dispersion relation and obtaining the instability growth rate, we explored it versus several physical parameters: electron&amp;rsquo;s and proton&amp;rsquo;s relativistic factors and the mass and luminosity of AGN, which are supposed to be Kerr black holes.</description>

The distribution of stars and stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes) within globular clusters holds clues about their formation and long-term evolution, with important implications for their initial mass function (IMF) and the formation of black hole mergers. In this work, we present best-fitting multimass models for 37 Milky Way globular clusters, which were inferred from various datasets, including proper motions from Gaia EDR3 and HST, line-of-sight velocities from ground-based spectroscopy and deep stellar mass functions from HST.</description>

Measurements of the growth rate of structures at $z &amp;lt; 0.1$ with peculiar velocity surveys have the potential of testing the validity of general relativity on cosmic scales. In this work, we present growth-rate measurements from realistic simulated sets of type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We describe our simulation methodology, the light-curve fitting and peculiar velocity estimation. Using the maximum likelihood method, we derive constraints on $f\sigma_8$ using only ZTF SN Ia peculiar velocities.</description>

We use the emulation framework CosmoPower to construct and publicly release neural network emulators of cosmological observables, including the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization power spectra, matter power spectrum, distance-redshift relation, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and redshift-space distortion (RSD) observables, and derived parameters. We train our emulators on Einstein-Boltzmann calculations obtained with high-precision numerical convergence settings, for a wide range of cosmological models including $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $\Lambda$CDM+$N_\mathrm{eff}$, and $\Lambda$CDM+$\Sigma m_\nu$.</description>

      <description>Avi Vajpeyi
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising environments for the assembly of merging binary black hole (BBH) systems. Interest in AGNs as nurseries for merging BBH is rising following the detection of gravitational waves from a BBH system from the purported pair-instability mass gap, most notably, GW190521. Active galactic nuclei have also been invoked to explain the formation of the high-mass-ratio system, GW190814. We draw on simulations of BBH systems in AGN to propose a phenomenological model for the distribution of black hole spins of merging binaries in AGN disks.</description>

We estimate the UV continuum slope ($\beta$) of 465 galaxies (with luminosities of 0.028 $-$ 3.3 $L^{}{z=0.5}$) in the Great Observatories Origins Survey (GOODS) Northern field in the redshift range $z=0.40 - 0.75$. We use two AstroSat/UVIT (N242W, N245M), two HST (F275W, F336W), and a KPNO (U) bands to sample the UV continuum slope of selected galaxies between 1215 and 2600 angstrom. The mean (median) and 1$\sigma$ scatter in the observed $\beta$ are found to be $-1.</description>

The problem of missing baryons in the local universe remains an open question. One propose alternative is that at low redshift missing baryons are in the form of the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). In order to test this idea, we present a detailed analysis of X-ray high-resolution spectra of six extragalactic sources, Mrk 421, 1ES 1028+511, 1ES 1553+113, H2356-309, PKS 0558-504 and PG 1116+215, obtained with the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer to search for signals of WHIM and/or circumgalactic medium (CGM) X-ray absorbing gas.</description>

A new model grid containing 228,016 synthetic red supergiant explosions (Type II supernovae) is introduced. Time evolution of spectral energy distributions from 1 A to 50,000 A (100 frequency bins in a log scale) is computed at each time step up to 500 days after explosion in each model. We provide light curves for the filters of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory&amp;rsquo;s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), Sloan Digital Sky Servey (SDSS), and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, but light curves for any photometric filters can be constructed by convolving any filter response functions to the synthetic spectral energy distributions.</description>

JWST observations confirm the existence of galaxies as early as 300Myr and at a higher number density than expected based on galaxy formation models and HST observations. Yet, sources confirmed spectroscopically in the first 500Myr have estimated stellar masses $&amp;lt;5\times10^8M_\odot$, limiting the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for investigating substructure. We present a high-resolution spectroscopic and spatially resolved study of a rare bright galaxy at $z=9.</description>

Massive black hole (BH) mergers will be key targets of future gravitational wave and electromagnetic observational facilities. In order to constrain BH evolution with the information extracted from BH mergers, one must take into account the complex relationship between the population of merging BHs and the global BH population. We analyse the high-resolution cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulation Obelisk, run to redshift $z=3.5$, to study the properties of the merging BH population, and its differences with the underlying global BH population in terms of BH and galaxy properties.</description>

Current cosmological data exhibit discordance between indirect and some direct inferences of the present-day expansion rate, $H_0$. Early dark energy (EDE), which briefly increases the cosmic expansion rate prior to recombination, is a leading scenario for resolving this &amp;ldquo;Hubble tension&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; while preserving a good fit to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. However, this comes at the cost of changes in parameters that affect structure formation in the late-time universe, including the spectral index of scalar perturbations, $n_s$.</description>

Mergers play a complex role in galaxy formation and evolution. Continuing to improve our understanding of these systems require ever larger samples, which can be difficult (even impossible) to select from individual surveys. We use the new platform ESA Datalabs to assemble a catalogue of interacting galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope science archives; this catalogue is larger than previously published catalogues by nearly an order of magnitude.</description>

We study the impact of galaxy mergers on stellar population profiles/gradients of early-type galaxies (ETGs) using ETGs at $z&amp;amp;lt;0.055$ in the Stripe 82 region of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and MaNGA integral field unit spectroscopic data. Tidal features around ETGs, which are detected from deep coadded images, are regarded as direct observational evidence for recent mergers. We find that ETGs with tidal features have less negative metallicity gradients and more positive age gradients than ETGs without tidal features at $M_\mathrm{star}\gtrsim10^{10.</description>

      <description>First author: Yuren Zhou
We select 753 S0 galaxies from the internal Product Lauch-10 of MaNGA survey (MPL-10) and find that $\sim$11% of S0 galaxies show gas-star kinematic misalignments, which is higher than the misaligned fraction in spiral ($\sim$1%) and elliptical galaxies ($\sim$6%) in MPL-10. If we only consider the emission-line galaxies (401 emission-line S0s), the misaligned fraction in S0s increases to $\sim$20%. In S0s, the kinematic misalignments are more common than the merger remnant features ($\sim$8%).</description>

We present a detailed analysis of numerical discreteness errors in two-species, gravity-only, cosmological simulations using the density power spectrum as a diagnostic probe. In a simple setup where both species are initialized with the same total matter transfer function, biased growth of power forms on small scales when the solver force resolution is finer than the mean interparticle separation. The artificial bias is more severe when individual density and velocity transfer functions are applied.</description>

      <description>First author: Ivan Almeida
We present a simple model for low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) feedback through thermal winds produced by a hot accretion flow. The wind carries considerable energy and deposits it on the host galaxy at kiloparsec scales and beyond, heating the galactic gas thereby quenching star formation. Our model predicts that the typical LLAGN can quench more than $10%$ of star formation in its host galaxy. We find that long-lived LLAGN winds from supermassive black holes (SMBH) with masses $\geq 10^8 M_{\odot}$ and mass accretion rates $\dot{M} &amp;gt; 10^{-3}\dot{M}{\rm Edd}$ can prevent gas collapse and significantly quench galactic star formation compared to a scenario without AGN, if the wind persists over 1 Myr.</description>

Aims. Previous studies reported an alignment of the major axes of radio galaxies on various angular scales. Here, we study the alignment of radio galaxies in the ELAIS-N1 Low Frequency ARray (LOFAR) deep field, which covers an area of 25 $\rm deg^2$. \newline Methods. The low noise level of about 20$ \rm ~ \mu Jy/beam$ of the LOFAR deep field observations at 150 MHz enabled the identification of 447 extended ($&amp;gt; 30 \rm &amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;$) radio galaxies for which we have measured the major axis position angle.</description>

Galaxy-scale strong lenses in galaxy clusters provide a unique tool to investigate their inner mass distribution and the sub-halo density profiles in the low-mass regime, which can be compared with the predictions from cosmological simulations. We search for galaxy-galaxy strong-lensing systems in HST multi-band imaging of galaxy cluster cores from the CLASH and HFF programs by exploring the classification capabilities of deep learning techniques. Convolutional neural networks are trained utilising highly-realistic simulations of galaxy-scale strong lenses injected into the HST cluster fields around cluster members.</description>

To better understand the formation of large, low surface brightness galaxies, we measure the correlation function between ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidates and Milky Way analogs (MWAs). We find that (1) the projected radial distribution of UDG satellites (projected surface density $\propto r^{-0.84\pm0.06}$) is consistent with that of normal satellite galaxies, (2) the number of UDG satellites per MWA ($S_{\rm UDG}$) is $\sim 0.5\pm0.1$ over projected radii from 20 to 250 kpc and $-17&amp;lt; M_r &amp;lt; -13.</description>

We discover analytic equations that can infer the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from the positions and velocity moduli of halo and galaxy catalogues. The equations are derived by combining a tailored graph neural network (GNN) architecture with symbolic regression. We first train the GNN on dark matter halos from Gadget N-body simulations to perform field-level likelihood-free inference, and show that our model can infer $\Omega_{\rm m}$ with $\sim6%$ accuracy from halo catalogues of thousands of N-body simulations run with six different codes: Abacus, CUBEP$^3$M, Gadget, Enzo, PKDGrav3, and Ramses.</description>

The stellar population environments associated with fast radio burst (FRB) sources provide important insights for developing their progenitor theories. We expand the diversity of known FRB host environments by reporting two FRBs in massive galaxy clusters discovered by the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110) during its commissioning observations. FRB 20220914A has been localized to a star-forming, late-type galaxy at a redshift of 0.1139 with multiple starbursts at lookback times less than $\sim$3.</description>

The hot gas that constitutes the intracluster medium (ICM) has been studied at X-ray and millimeter/sub-millimeter wavelengths (Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect) for decades. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) offer an additional method of directly measuring the ICM and gas surrounding clusters, via observables such as dispersion measure (DM) and Faraday rotation measure (RM). We report the discovery of two FRB sources detected with the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110) whose host galaxies belong to massive galaxy clusters.</description>

Consistent with a rapid formation of the host galaxies, the star formation histories (SFHs) have small e-folding, at most 750 Myrs using an SFH function for Spiral or 1000 Myrs using one for Elliptical.</description>

      <description>First author: Baptiste Blachier
We revisit how super-Hubble cosmological fluctuations induce, at any time in the cosmic history, a non-vanishing spatial curvature of the local background metric. The random nature of these fluctuations promotes the curvature density parameter to a stochastic quantity for which we derive novel non-perturbative expressions for its mean, variance, higher moments and full probability distribution. For scale-invariant Gaussian perturbations, such as those favored by cosmological observations, we find that the most probable value for the curvature density parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ today is $-10^{-9}$, that its mean is $+10^{-9}$, both being overwhelmed by a standard deviation of order $10^{-5}$.</description>

We corrected our data for the presence of the $^{12}$CO $J=3\to 2$ line in the SCUBA-2 850$\mu$m bandwidth using NGLS HARP data, finding a typical $^{12}$CO contribution of $\sim 20$%. We measured dust column densities, temperatures and opacity indices by fitting spectral energy distributions constructed from SCUBA-2 and archival Herschel observations, and used archival GALEX and Spitzer data to make maps of surface density of star formation ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$).</description>

Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) have been detected to $z\sim4$ and can be detected to $z\gtrsim15$ using current and upcoming facilities. SLSNe are extremely UV luminous, and hence objects at $z\gtrsim7$ are detected exclusively via their rest-frame UV using optical and infrared facilities. SLSNe have great utility in multiple areas of stellar and galactic evolution. Here, we explore the potential use of SLSNe type-I as high-redshift cosmological distance indicators in their rest-frame UV.</description>

Dwarf galaxies are excellent cosmological probes, because their shallow potential wells make them very sensitive to the key processes that drive galaxy evolution, including baryonic feedback, tidal interactions, and ram pressure stripping. However, some of the key parameters of dwarf galaxies, which help trace the effects of these processes, are still debated, including the relationship between their sizes and masses. We re-examine the Fornax Cluster dwarf population from the point of view of isomass-radius&amp;ndash;stellar mass relations (IRSMRs) using the Fornax Deep Survey Dwarf galaxy Catalogue, with the centrally located (among dwarfs) $3.</description>

Recent observations have reignited interest in a population of dwarf galaxies that are large and diffuse for their mass, often called ultra-diffuse galaxies. However, the origin and evolution of these mass-size outliers and the role of environment are still unclear. Using the exquisitely deep and wide Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey images, we search for ultra-puffy galaxies, defined as being $1.5\sigma$ larger than the average size for their mass, around Milky-Way&amp;ndash;like galaxies.</description>

Local galaxies are known to broadly follow a bimodal distribution: actively star forming and quiescent system (i.e. galaxies with no or negligible star formation activity at the epoch of observation). Why, when and how such bimodality was established, and whether it has been associated with different processes at different cosmic epochs, is still a key open question in extragalactic astrophysics. Directly observing early quiescent galaxies in the primordial Universe is therefore of utmost importance to constraining models of galaxy formation and transformation.</description>

Thermal X-ray spectra from supernova remnants (SNRs) are dominated by a number of line emission from various elements. Resolving the individual lines is critically important for a variety of scientific topics such as diagnosing high-temperature and low-density non-equilibrium plasmas, identifying spectral features like charge exchange and resonance line scattering, revealing kinematics and elemental abundances of SN ejecta and the circumstellar medium, and studying the interstellar medium or planets&amp;rsquo; atmospheres from extinction features seen in X-ray spectra of very bright SNRs.</description>

Combining the `time-delay distance&amp;rsquo; ($D_{\Delta t}$) measurements from galaxy lenses and other distance indicators provides model-independent determinations of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and spatial curvature ($\Omega_{K,0}$), only based on the validity of the Friedmann-Lema^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric and geometrical optics. To take the full merit of combining $D_{\Delta t}$ measurements in constraining $H_0$, we use gamma-ray burst (GRB) distances to extend the redshift coverage of lensing systems much higher than that of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) and even higher than quasars, whilst the general cosmography with a curvature component is implemented for the GRB distance parametrizations.</description>

Very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-rays ($\gtrsim 0.1\rm~TeV$) and neutrinos are crucial for identifying accelerators of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), but this is challenging especially for UHECR nuclei. In this work, we develop a numerical code to solve the transport equation for UHECRs and their secondaries, where both nuclear and electromagnetic cascades are taken into account self-consistently, considering steady UHECR accelerators such as radio galaxies. In particular, we focus on Centaurus A, which has been proposed as one of the most promising UHECR sources in the local universe.</description>

We train graph neural networks to perform field-level likelihood-free inference using galaxy catalogs from state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of the CAMELS project. Our models are rotationally, translationally, and permutation invariant and have no scale cutoff. By training on galaxy catalogs that only contain the 3D positions and radial velocities of approximately $1,000$ galaxies in tiny volumes of $(25~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^3$, our models achieve a precision of approximately $12$% when inferring the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$.</description>

      <description>First author: P. Noterdaeme
Proximate molecular quasar absorbers (PH2) are an intriguing population of absorption systems recently uncovered through strong H2 absorption at small velocity separation from the background quasars. We performed a multi-wavelength spectroscopic follow-up of thirteen such systems with VLT/X-Shooter. Here, we present the observations and study the overall chemical enrichment measured from the HI, H2 and metal lines. We combine this with an investigation of the neutral gas kinematics with respect to the quasar host.</description>

      <description>First author: Wen-Juan Zhong
We reanalyze the Fermi-LAT GeV $\gamma$-ray emission in the region of supernova remnant (SNR) G51.26+0.11 and investigate its interstellar molecular environment with the CO-line data. At GeV energies, based on 13.2 years of Fermi-LAT data, the extended $\gamma$-ray emission observed in this region is resolved into a uniform-disk source (&amp;lsquo;Src A&amp;rsquo;) with a significance of 19.5$\sigma$ and a point source (4FGL J1924.3+1628) with a significance of 4.</description>

      <description>First author: Ethan R. Partington
The AGN STORM 2 collaboration targeted the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 for a year-long multiwavelength, coordinated reverberation mapping campaign including HST, Swift, XMM-Newton, NICER, and ground-based observatories. Early observations with NICER and XMM revealed an X-ray state ten times fainter than historical observations, consistent with the presence of a new dust-free, ionized obscurer. The following analysis of NICER spectra attributes variability in the observed X-ray flux to changes in both the column density of the obscurer by at least one order of magnitude ($N_\mathrm{H}$ ranges from $2.</description>

We present an adapted version of the code HII-CHI-Mistry-UV (P&#39;erez-Montero &amp;amp; Amor&#39;in 2017) to derive chemical abundances from emission lines in the ultraviolet, for use in narrow line regions (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We evaluate different ultraviolet emission line ratios and how different assumptions about the models, including the presence of dust grains, the shape of the incident spectral energy distribution, or the thickness of the gas envelope around the central source, may affect the final estimates as a function of the set of emission lines used.</description>

For the first time, the sulphur abundance relative to hydrogen (S/H) in the Narrow Line Regions of a sample of Seyfert 2 nuclei (Sy 2s) has been derived via direct estimation of the electron temperature. Narrow emission line intensities from the SDSS DR17 [in the wavelength range 3000 &amp;lt; $\lambda$ &amp;lt; 9100] and from the literature for a sample of 45 nearby ($z$ &amp;lt; 0.</description>

      <title>CMB constraints on the early universe independent of late time cosmology</title>

      <description>First author: Pablo Lemos
The CMB is a powerful probe of early-universe physics but is only observed after passing through large-scale structure, which changes the observed spectra in important model-dependent ways. This is of particular concern given recent claims of significant discrepancies with low redshift data sets when a standard $\Lambda$CDM model is assumed. By using empirical measurements of the CMB lensing reconstruction, combined with weak priors on the smoothness of the lensing spectrum, foregrounds, and shape of any additional integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, we show how the early-universe parameters can be constrained from CMB observations almost independently of the late-time evolution.</description>

      <description>First author: Junyao Li
We propose a new method to constrain the size of the dusty torus in broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using optical and mid-infrared (MIR) ensemble structure functions (SFs). Because of the geometric dilution of the torus, the mid-infrared response to optical continuum variations has suppressed variability with respect to the optical that depends on the geometry (e.g., size, orientation and opening angle) of the torus. More extended tori have steeper MIR SFs with respect to the optical SF.</description>

      <description>First author: Carl L. Rodriguez
Globular clusters are among the oldest stellar populations in the Milky Way; consequently, they also host some of the oldest known stellar-mass black holes, providing insight into black hole formation and evolution in the early ($z\gtrsim 2$) Universe. Recent observations of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies have been invoked to suggest the possibility of a cosmological coupling between astrophysical black holes and the surrounding expanding Universe, offering a mechanism for black holes to grow over cosmic time, and potentially explaining the origin of dark energy.</description>

      <description>First author: Matthew D. A. Orkney
Purely collisionless Dark Matter Only (DMO) structure formation simulations predict that Dark Matter (DM) haloes are typically prolate in their centres and spheroidal towards their outskirts. The addition of gas cooling transforms the central DM shape to be rounder and more oblate. It is not clear, however, whether such shape transformations occur in `ultra-faint&amp;rsquo; dwarfs, which have extremely low baryon fractions. We present the first study of the shape and velocity anisotropy of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies that have gas mass fractions of $f_{\rm gas}(r&amp;lt;R_{\rm half}) &amp;lt; 0.</description>

Since the 1990s, we have known that there is a super-massive black hole in every galaxy, and that its mass is proportional to the mass of the bulge. To better understand how these black holes were formed, in symbiosis with their galaxies, we will look at their demography, the scaling relations between properties of black holes and host galaxies, and their evolution in a Hubble time.</description>

      <description>First author: Juliana Kwan
We construct accurate emulators for the projected and redshift space galaxy correlation functions and excess surface density as measured by galaxy-galaxy lensing, based on Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) modeling. Using the complete Mira-Titan suite of 111 $N$-body simulations, our emulators vary over eight cosmological parameters and include the effects of neutrino mass and dynamical dark energy. We demonstrate that our emulators are sufficiently accurate for the analysis of the BOSS DR12 CMASS galaxy sample over the range 0.</description>

The development and implementation of GEAR-RT, a radiative transfer solver using the M1 closure in the open source code SWIFT, is presented, and validated using standard tests for radiative transfer. GEAR-RT is modeled after RAMSES-RT (Rosdahl et al. 2013) with some key differences. Firstly, while RAMSES-RT uses Finite Volume methods and an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) strategy, GEAR-RT employs particles as discretization elements and solves the equations using a Finite Volume Particle Method (FVPM).</description>

Over-luminous type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) show peculiar observational features, for which an explosion of a super-massive white dwarf (WD) beyond the classical Chandrasekhar-limiting mass has been suggested, largely based on their high luminosities and slow light-curve evolution. However, their observational features are diverse, with a few extremely peculiar features whose origins have not been clarified; strong and persisting C II lines, late-time accelerated luminosity decline and red spectra, and a sub-day time-scale initial flash clearly identified so far at least for three over-luminous SNe Ia.</description>

We report the discovery of a remarkable Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxy at $z=7.278$, JADES-GS+53.16746-27.7720 (shortened to JADES-GS-z7-LA), with EW$0$(Ly$\alpha$) $\approx400 \pm 90$A and UV magnitude $-16.7$. The spectroscopic redshift is confirmed via rest-frame optical lines $[O II]$, H$\beta$ and $[O III]$ in its JWST/NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) spectrum. The Ly$\alpha$ line is detected in both lower resolution ($R\sim100$) PRISM as well as medium resolution ($R\sim1000$) G140M grating spectra.</description>

The local radio-loud AGN population is dominated by compact sources named FR0s. These sources show features, for example the host type, the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH), and the multi-band nuclear characteristics, that are similar to those of FRI radio galaxies. However, in the radio band, while FR0 and FRI share the same nuclear properties, the kiloparsec-scale diffuse component dominant in FRI is missing in FR0s.</description>

Our vision of galaxies has changed significantly since the era of large galaxy surveys like the Sloan, which gave us extensive statistics with millions of galaxies. The Hubble sequence classification described in Chapter 1 still remains very widely used but has been enriched with broad categories based on color that indicate the recent formation of stars: the red sequence of passive galaxies, consisting solely of old stars, and the blue cloud of galaxies with active star formation.</description>

We present analysis of 63 nearby ($&amp;lt;$ 44 Mpc) early-type galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters using the recently discovered parameter Central Intensity Ratio (CIR$_I$) determined from near-infra-red (3.6 $\mu$m) observations with the Infra-red-array-camera of \emph{Spitzer} space telescope. The CIR$_I$, when combined with filters involving age and $B-K$ colour of host galaxies, helps identify two distinct classes of galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters.

Using Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging data in the $grizy$ bands for SRG/eROSITA-detected AGNs, we measure the structural parameters for AGN host galaxies by performing a 2D AGN-host image decomposition. We then conduct spectral energy distribution fitting to derive stellar mass and rest-frame colors for AGN hosts.</description>

We search for box/peanut bulges (BPs) in this sample, finding them in 55% of cases. We compute $\fbp$, the BP probability for barred galaxies as a function of $\Mstar$, and find that this rises to a plateau, as found in observations of nearby galaxies.</description>

Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) leave unique signatures in the bispectrum of the large-scale structure. With upcoming galaxy surveys set to improve PNG constraints by at least one order of magnitude, it is important to account for any potential contamination. In our work we show how to include wide-angle effects into the 3-dimensional observed galaxy bispectrum. We compute the leading wide-angle corrections to the monopole, finding that they could mimic local PNG with an amplitude of $f_{\rm NL} = \mathcal{O}\left( 0.</description>

In the nearby universe jets from AGN are observed to have a dramatic impact on their surrounding extragalactic environment.

Here we present a study of the giant (750 kpc) radio galaxy 103025+052430 located at the centre of a protocluster at redshift z=1.7, with a focus on its interaction with the external medium.</description>

Detailed knowledge of the different classes of stellar orbits that can be accommodated in a given galactic potential is a prerequisite when building self-consistent models using for instance the Schwazschild technique. Furthermore, observational properties of galaxies depend on what these classes of orbits are and on the presence of chaos in the systems. In the realistic case in which the starting point for modeling is not a gravitational potential, but an observed density distribution, we will require a gravitational theory to make the connection between the stars that we see and the movement these stars may be having.</description>

We combine an unprecedented MaNGA sample of over 3,000 passive galaxies in the stellar mass range 10^{9}-10^{12} Msun with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey group catalog by Tinker to quantify how central and satellite formation, quantified by radial profiles in stellar age, $[Fe/H]$, and $[Mg/Fe]$, depends on the stellar mass of the galaxy (M*) and the mass of the host halo (Mh). After controlling for M* and Mh, the stacked spectra of centrals and satellites beyond the effective radius (r_e) show small, yet significant differences in multiple spectral features at the 1% level.</description>

      <description>First author: Jiayi Sun
We measure empirical relationships between the local star formation rate (SFR) and properties of the star-forming molecular gas on 1.5 kpc scales across 80 nearby galaxies. These relationships, commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;star formation laws,&amp;rdquo; aim at predicting the local SFR surface density from various combinations of molecular gas surface density, galactic orbital time, molecular cloud free-fall time, and the interstellar medium dynamical equilibrium pressure. Leveraging a multiwavelength database built for the PHANGS survey, we measure these quantities consistently across all galaxies and quantify systematic uncertainties stemming from choices of SFR calibrations and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factors.</description>

We use the recently discovered simple photometric parameter Central Intensity Ratio (CIR, Aswathy &amp;amp; Ravikumar 2018) determined for a sample of 57 nearby (z &amp;lt; 0.02) Seyfert galaxies to explore the central features of galaxies and their possible connection with galaxy evolution. The sample of galaxies shows strong anti-correlation between CIR and mass of their central supermassive black holes (SMBH). The SMBH masses of ellipticals are systematically higher for a given CIR value than that for lenticulars and spirals in the sample.</description>

Clusters of galaxies are sensitive to the most nonlinear peaks in the cosmic density field. The weak gravitational lensing of background galaxies by clusters can allow us to infer their masses. However, galaxies associated with the local environment of the cluster can also be intrinsically aligned due to the local tidal gradient, contaminating any cosmology derived from the lensing signal. We measure this intrinsic alignment in Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 redMaPPer clusters.</description>

The MeerKAT Fornax Survey maps the distribution and kinematics of atomic neutral hydrogen gas (HI) in the nearby Fornax galaxy cluster using the MeerKAT telescope. The 12 deg^2 survey footprint covers the central region of the cluster out to ~ Rvir and stretches out to ~ 2 Rvir towards south west to include the NGC 1316 galaxy group. The HI column density sensitivity (3 sigma over 25 km/s) ranges from 5e+19/cm^2 at a resolution of ~ 10&amp;quot; (~ 1 kpc at the 20 Mpc distance of Fornax) down to ~ 1e+18/cm^2 at ~ 1&amp;rsquo; (~ 6 kpc), and slightly below this level at the lowest resolution of ~ 100&amp;quot; (~ 10 kpc).</description>

We utilize high-resolution cosmological simulations to reveal that high-redshift galaxies tend to undergo a robust wet compaction&#39; event when near a golden&amp;rsquo; stellar mass of $\sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. This is a gaseous shrinkage to a compact star-forming phase, a blue nugget&#39; (BN), followed by central quenching of star formation to a compact passive stellar bulge, a red nugget&amp;rsquo; (RN), and a buildup of an extended gaseous disc and ring.</description>

The Reionization Cluster Survey (RELICS) imaged 41 galaxy clusters with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), in order to detect lensed and high-redshift galaxies. Each cluster was imaged to about 26.5 AB mag in three optical and four near-infrared bands, taken in two distinct visits separated by varying time intervals. We make use of the multiple near-infrared epochs to search for transient sources in the cluster fields, with the primary motivation of building statistics for bright caustic crossing events in gravitational arcs.</description>

Our ultraviolet observations are accompanied by X-ray, optical, and near-infrared observations as part of the AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping Program 2 (AGN STORM 2). Using the cross-correlation lag analysis method, we find significant correlated variations in the continuum and emission-line light curves.</description>

Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is a promising technique to constrain the global distribution of galaxy properties. To combine LIM experiments probing different tracers with traditional galaxy surveys and fully exploit the scientific potential of these observations, it is necessary to have a physically motivated modeling framework. As part of developing such a framework, in this work we introduce and model the conditional galaxy property distribution (CGPD), i.</description>

We examine the potential for using the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network of gravitational-wave detectors to provide constraints on the physical properties of core-collapse supernovae through the observation of their gravitational radiation. We use waveforms generated by 14 of the latest 3D hydrodynamic core-collapse supernova simulations, which are added to noise samples based on the predicted sensitivities of the GW detectors during the O5 observing run. Then we use the BayesWave algorithm to model-independently reconstruct the gravitational-wave waveforms, which are used as input for various machine learning algorithms.</description>

We collect a large sample with a reliable redshift detected by the Fermi satellite after 10 years of data (4FGL-DR2), including blazars, $\gamma$-ray Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies ($\gamma$NLS1s), and radio galaxies. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these Fermi sources are fitted by using a second-degree polynomial, and some important parameters including spectral curvature, synchrotron peak frequency, and peak luminosity are obtained. Based on those parameters, we discuss the Fermi blazar sequence and the particle acceleration mechanism.</description>

Multi-wavelength images from the Hubble Space Telescope covering the wavelength range 0.27-1.6 $\mu$m show that the central area of the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC4449 contains several tens of compact sources that are emitting in the hydrogen recombination line Pa$\beta$ (1.2818 $\mu$m) but are only marginally detected in H$\alpha$ (0.6563 $\mu$m) and undetected at wavelengths $\lambda\le$0.55 $\mu$m. An analysis of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these sources indicates that they are likely relatively young star clusters heavily attenuated by dust.</description>

The morphology of a galaxy has been shown to encode the evolutionary history and correlates strongly with physical properties such as stellar mass, star formation rates and past merger events. While the majority of galaxies in the local universe can be classified on the Hubble sequence, little is known about the different types of galaxies we observe at high redshift. The irregular morphology of these galaxies makes visual classifications difficult, and with the future of astronomy consisting of many &amp;ldquo;Big Data&amp;rdquo; surveys we need an efficient, and unbiased classification system in place.</description>

Galaxy mergers are hugely important in our current dark matter cosmology. These powerful events cause the disruption of the merging galaxies, pushing the gas, stars and dust of the galaxies resulting in changes to morphologies. This disruption can also cause more extreme events inside the galaxies: periods of extreme star formation rates and the rapid increase in active galactic nuclei activity. Hence, to better understand what goes on in these rare events, we need to be able to identify statistically large samples.</description>

Our modeled mean spectra suggest the ~6150~\AA\ feature in SNe~IIb may have an underlying contribution due to silicon, while the same feature in some SNe Ib may have an underlying contribution due to hydrogen.</description>

We measure the total mass of clusters, groups, and galaxies at radius $R_{2500}$, finding that the $M_{2500} \propto T^{\alpha}$ relation follows a power-law with $\alpha$ = 1.</description>

We perform 3D radiation hydrodynamic local shearing box simulations to study the outcome of gravitational instability (GI) in optically thick Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. GI develops when the Toomre parameter QT \leq 1, and may lead to turbulent heating that balances radiative cooling. However, when radiative cooling is too efficient, the disk may undergo runaway gravitational fragmentation. In the fully gas-pressure-dominated case, we confirm the classical result that such a thermal balance holds when the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter (alpha) due to the gravitationally-driven turbulence is \sim 0.</description>

Clumps are detected in H$\alpha$ and near-UV, tracing star formation on different timescales. We consider clumps located in galaxy disks, in the stripped tails and those formed in stripped gas but still close to the disk, called extraplanar.</description>

The spectral shape of the gamma-ray emission observed for dynamically old supernova remnants that interact with molecular clouds triggered an exciting scenario of adiabatic compression and farther re-acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) in radiative shells of the remnants, which was extensively discussed and applied to various sources over recent years. Indeed, the observed gamma-ray spectrum from a number of remnants strongly resembles the expected spectrum of the gamma-ray emission from the compressed population of Galactic cosmic rays.</description>

UV-FIR SED modeling is an effective way to disentangle emission between star formation (SF) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxies; however, this approach becomes uncertain for composite AGN/SF galaxies that comprise 50-70% of IR-samples. Cosmic X-ray background (XRB) models require a large fraction of obscured AGN to reproduce the observed XRB peak, motivating reliable SED analyses in objects where the AGN may be ``buried&amp;quot; in the galaxy and in the mid-IR to far-IR SED.</description>

A small subset of extragalactic double radio sources, termed HYMORS (HYbrid MOrpholgy Radio Sources), is distinguished by a very unusual, hybrid morphology in terms of the Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classification. In HYMORS, one radio lobe appears edge-darkened (FR I), while the other shows a well-defined emission peak near its outer edge (edge-brightened, FR II). Such sources are rare but critical for constraining the mechanism responsible for the FR dichotomy, a widely debated issue in extragalactic astrophysics.</description>

      <description>First author: Seokcheon Lee
The Friedmann-Lema^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker model establishes the correlation between redshifts and distances. It has a metric expansion of space. As a result, the wavelength of photons propagating through the expanding space is stretched, creating the cosmological redshift, $z$. It also relates the frequency of light detected by a local observer to that emitted from a distant source. In standard cosmology (\textit{i.e.} a constant speed light model, $c =$ constant), this relation is given by a factor $1/(1+z)$$[1]$.</description>

We present the first results from an imaging and a spectroscopic survey of the optical emission associated with supernova remnant (SNR) G107.5$-$1.5. We discovered optical diffuse and filamentary emission from G107.5$-$1.5 using the 1.5-m and 1-m telescopes. The optical emission from the North East (NE) and North West (NW) regions show the diffuse structure, while the South East (SE) and East (E) regions show filamentary structure.</description>

      <description>First author: Ian Blackstone
Radiation pressure on dust is an important feedback process around star clusters and may eject gas from bright sub-regions in star-forming galaxies. The Eddington ratio has previously been constructed for galaxy-averaged observations, individual star clusters, and Galactic HII regions. Here we assess the role of radiation pressure in thousands of sub-regions across two local star-forming galaxies, NGC 6946 and NGC 5194. Using a model for the spectral energy distribution from stellar population synthesis and realistic dust grain scattering and absorption, we compute flux- and radiation pressure-mean opacities and population-averaged optical depth $\langle\tau_{\rm RP}\rangle$.</description>

We explore the properties of galaxies in the proximity (within a $\sim$2 Mpc radius sphere) of Type I quasars at 0.1&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;0.35, to check whether and how an active galaxy influences the properties of its neighbors. We further compare these with the properties of neighbors around inactive galaxies of the same mass and redshift within the same volume of space, using the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic survey.</description>

As the earliest relics of star formation episodes in the history of the Universe, the most massive galaxies are the key to our understanding of the evolution of the stellar population, cosmic structure, and SMBHs. However, the details of their formation histories remain uncertain. We address these problems by planning a large survey sample of ultramassive galaxies ($z\le0.3$, $|\delta+24^{\circ}|&amp;lt;45$\deg, $|b|&amp;gt;8$\deg), including 76% E, 17% S0, and 7% S brighter than $M_K\le-27$ mag (stellar mass $2\times10^{12}&amp;lt;M_\star&amp;lt;5\times10^{12}$ M$\odot$) with the HARMONI instrument on ELT.</description>

We perform multi-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations in a massive scalar-tensor theory for the first time with a realistic equation of state and multi-energy neutrino radiation. Among the set of our models varying the scalar mass and the coupling strength between the scalar and gravitational fields, a particular model allows for recurrent spontaneous scalarizations (SSs) in the proto-neutron star (PNS). Each SS induces the PNS collapse and subsequent bounce, from which devastating shock waves emanate and eject the PNS envelope.</description>

      <description>First author: R. Calvi
There is controversy whether dusty starbursts selected at submillimeter wavelengths can trace galaxy overdensities. We perform the first systematic search for protoclusters around a homogeneously selected sample of 12 spectroscopically confirmed submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $z\sim1.2-5.3$ in the GOODS-N field. We applied the Poisson Probability Method (PPM) to search for Mpc scale overdensities around these SMGs using three photometric redshift catalogs. We detect galaxy overdensities for 11 out of the 12 SMGs ($92%\pm8$%), distributed over eight protoclusters.</description>

      <description>First author: Fulvio Melia
The so-called impossibly early galaxy&#39; problem, first identified via the Hubble Space Telescope&#39;s observation of galaxies at redshifts z &amp;gt; 10, appears to have been exacerbated by the more recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovery of galaxy candidates at even higher redshifts (z ~ 17) which, however, are yet to be confirmed spectroscopically. These candidates would have emerged only ~ 230 million years after the big bang in the context of LCDM, requiring a more rapid star formation in the earliest galaxies than appears to be permitted by simulations adopting the concordance model parameters.</description>

We use the large spectroscopic dataset of the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey to investigate some of the key factors responsible for the elevated ionization parameters (U) inferred for high-redshift galaxies, focusing in particular on the role of star-formation-rate surface density (Sigma_SFR). Using a sample of 317 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts z~1.9-3.7, we construct composite rest-frame optical spectra in bins of Sigma_SFR and infer electron densities, n_e, using the ratio of the $[OII]$ 3727, 3730 doublet.</description>

      <description>First author: Jakob M. Helton
We report the discovery of an extreme galaxy overdensity at $z = 5.4$ in the GOODS-S field using JWST/NIRCam imaging from JADES and JEMS alongside JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO. We identified potential members of the overdensity using HST+JWST photometry spanning $\lambda = 0.4-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}$. These data provide accurate and well-constrained photometric redshifts down to $m \approx 29-30,\mathrm{mag}$. We subsequently confirmed $N = 96$ potential members of the overdensity using JWST slitless spectroscopy over $\lambda = 3.</description>

These metal-poor, gaseous Population III stars are likely in the mass range $10-10^3 M_\odot$. We develop a framework for calculating the abundances of Pop III stars as well as the distribution of the most massive Pop III stars based on an application of extreme-value statistics.</description>

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are successful cosmological distance indicators and important element factories in the chemical evolution of galaxies. They are generally thought to originate from thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in close binaries. However, the observed diversity among SNe Ia implies that they have different progenitor models. In this article, we performed the long-term evolution of NS+He star binaries with different initial He star masses ($M_{\rm He}^{\rm i}$) and orbital periods ($P_{\rm orb}^{\rm i}$) for the first time, in which the He star companions can explode as SNe Ia eventually.</description>

The chemical inventory of hot Jupiter (HJ) exoplanets atmospheres continue to be observed by various ground and space based instruments in increasing detail and precision. It is expected that some HJs will exhibit strong non-equilibrium chemistry characteristics in their atmospheres, which might be inferred from spectral observations. We aim to model the three dimensional thermochemical non-equilibrium chemistry in the atmospheres of the HJs WASP-39b and HD 189733b.</description>

The Milky Way accreted several smaller satellite galaxies in its history. These mergers added stars and gas to the Galaxy and affected the properties of the pre-existing stellar populations. Stellar chemical abundances and ages are needed to establish the chronological order of events that occur before, during, and after such mergers. We report precise ages ($\sim$6.5%) and chemical abundances for the Titans, a sample of old metal-poor dwarfs and subgiants with accurate atmospheric parameters.</description>

Line locking (LL) of absorption line systems is a clear signature of the dynamical importance of radiation pressure force in driving astrophysical flows, with recent findings suggesting that it may be common in quasars exhibiting multiple intrinsic narrow absorption-line (NAL) systems. In this work we probe the phase space conducive to LL and follow the detailed kinematics of those systems that may lock at the velocity separation of the CIV $\lambda\lambda 1548.</description>

We present the measurements of the small-scale clustering for the emission line galaxy (ELG) sample from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). We use conditional abundance matching method to interpret the clustering measurements from $0.34h^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}$ to $70h^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}$. In order to account for the correlation between properties of emission line galaxies and their environment, we add a secondary connection between star formation rate of ELGs and halo accretion rate.</description>

One of the open questions following the discovery of GW170817 is whether neutron star mergers are the only astrophysical sites capable of producing r-process elements. Simulations have shown that 0.01-0.1M$_\odot$ of r-process material could be generated in the outflows originating from the accretion disk surrounding the rapidly rotating black hole that forms as a remnant to both neutron star mergers and collapsing massive stars associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (collapsars).</description>

We introduce a new model for the accretion and feedback of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries to the KETJU code, which enables us to resolve the evolution of SMBH binaries down to separations of tens of Schwarzschild radii in gas-rich galaxy mergers. Our subgrid binary accretion model extends the widely used Bondi--Hoyle--Lyttleton accretion into the binary phase and incorporates preferential mass accretion onto the secondary SMBH, which is motivated by results from small-scale hydrodynamical circumbinary disc simulations.</description>

We have performed a systematic study of the rotational, orbital and X-ray properties of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) and compared their nature with those of the MSPs in the Galactic field (GF). We found that GC MSPs generally rotate slower than their counterparts in the GF. Different from the expectation of a simple recycling scenario, no evidence for the correlation between the orbital period and the rotation period can be found from the MSP binaries in GCs.</description>

Thermal energies deposited by OB stellar clusters in starburst galaxies lead to the formation of galactic superwinds. Multi-wavelength observations of starburst-driven superwinds pointed at complex thermal and ionization structures which cannot adequately be explained by simple adiabatic assumptions. In this study, we perform hydrodynamic simulations of a fluid model coupled to radiative cooling functions, and generate time-dependent non-equilibrium photoionization models to predict physical conditions and ionization structures of superwinds using the MAIHEM atomic and cooling package built on the program FLASH.</description>

      <description>First author: James M. Sullivan
Neutrino mass constraints are a primary focus of current and future large-scale structure (LSS) surveys. Non-linear LSS models rely heavily on cosmological simulations &amp;ndash; the impact of massive neutrinos should therefore be included in these simulations in a realistic, computationally tractable, and controlled manner. A recent proposal to reduce the related computational cost employs a symmetric neutrino momentum sampling strategy in the initial conditions. We implement a modified version of this strategy into the Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC) and perform convergence tests on its internal parameters.</description>

As groups of coeval stars born from the same molecular cloud, an Open cluster (OC) is an ideal laboratory for studying the structure and dynamical evolution of the Milky Way. The release of High-Precision Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) and modern machine-learning methods offer unprecedented opportunities to identify OCs. In this study, we extended conventional HDBSCAN (e-HDBSCAN) for searching for new OCs in Gaia EDR3. A pipeline was developed based on the parallel computing technique to blindly search for open clusters from Gaia EDR3 within Galactic latitudes $\left| b \right|$ $&amp;amp;lt;$25 $^\circ$.</description>

This chapter presents an overview of the recent progress on spectroscopic observations of metal-poor stars with r-process element signatures found in the Milky Way&amp;amp;#39;s stellar halo and satellite dwarf galaxies. Major empirical lessons related to the origins of the r-process are discussed, including the universality of the observed r-process pattern and deviations from universality among the light r-process elements and actinides. Different astrophysical sites of the r-process based on theoretical expectations are presented, including common and rare supernovae and neutron star mergers.</description>

Dark matter is a key piece of the current cosmological scenario, with weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) a leading dark matter candidate. WIMPs have not been detected in their conventional parameter space (100 GeV $\lesssim M_œá \lesssim$ 100 TeV), a mass range accessible with current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. As ultraheavy dark matter (UHDM; $M_œá \gtrsim$ 100 TeV) has been suggested as an under-explored alternative to the WIMP paradigm, we search for an indirect dark matter annihilation signal in a higher mass range (up to 30 PeV) with the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory.</description>

We present a photometric study of the resolved stellar populations in And IX, the closest satellite to the M31, a metal-poor and low-mass dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We estimate a distance modulus of $24.56_{-0.15}^{+0.05}$ mag based on the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB). By probing the variability of asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB), we study the star formation history of And IX. We identified 50 long period variables (LPVs) in And IX using the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) in two filters, Sloan $i&amp;amp;#39;$ and Harris $V$.</description>

Theoretical studies predict that the most significant growth of supermassive black holes occurs in late-stage mergers, coinciding with the manifestation of dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and both major and minor mergers are expected to be important for dual AGN growth. In fact, dual AGNs in minor mergers should be signposts for efficient minor merger-induced SMBH growth for both the more and less massive progenitor.</description>

We explore the environment of 351 grand-design and 541 flocculent spiral galaxies recently identified employing convolutional neural networks from the $17^{th}$ data release of Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We introduce a novel estimator called the Local Geometric Index to quantify the morphology of the local environment of these 892 spirals. Based on the local geometric index of the galaxies, we identify their local environments to be voids, sheets, filaments or clusters.</description>

Accurate active galactic nucleus (AGN) identifications in large galaxy samples are crucial to assess the role of AGN and AGN feedback in the coevolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. Emission line flux ratio diagnostics are the most common technique for identifying AGN in optical spectra. New large samples of integral field unit observations allow The exploration of the role of aperture size used for the classification.</description>

When the first galaxies formed and starlight escaped into the intergalactic medium to reionize it, galaxy formation and reionization were both highly inhomogeneous in time and space, and fully-coupled by mutual feedback. To show how this imprinted the UV luminosity function (UVLF) of reionization-era galaxies, we use our large-scale, radiation-hydrodynamics simulation CoDa II to derive the time- and space-varying halo mass function and UVLF, from $z\simeq6$-15.</description>

Direct observational evidence for the creation of nuclear star clusters (NSCs) is needed to support the proposed scenarios for their formation. We have analyzed the dwarf galaxy UGC 7346, located in the peripheral regions of the Virgo Cluster, to highlight a series of properties that indicate the formation of a NSC caught in its earlier stages. First, we report remnants of a past interaction in the form of diffuse streams or shells, suggesting a recent merge of two dwarf galaxies with a 1:5 stellar mass ratio.</description>

In this work, we explore the connection between the gravitational wave (GW) merger rates of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBH) and galaxy properties. We do this by generating populations of stars using the binary synthesis code COMPAS and evolving them in galaxies from the semi-analytic galaxy formation model {\sc Shark}, to determine the number of mergers occurring in each simulation time-step. We find that large, metal-rich galaxies with high star formation rates are more likely to have gravitational wave (GW) events compared to younger, more metal poor galaxies.</description>

KOSMOS is a low-resolution, long-slit, optical spectrograph that has been upgraded at the University of Washington for its move from Kitt Peak National Observatory&amp;rsquo;s Mayall 4m telescope to the Apache Point Observatory&amp;rsquo;s ARC 3.5m telescope. One of the additions to KOSMOS is a slitviewer, which requires the fabrication of reflective slits, as KOSMOS previously used matte slits machined via wire EDM. We explore a novel method of slit fabrication using nanofabrication methods and compare the slit edge roughness, width uniformity, and the resulting scattering of the new fabricated slits to the original slits.</description>

Recently, several studies reported a significant discrepancy between the clustering and lensing of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) galaxies in the $\textit{Planck}$ cosmology. We construct a simple yet powerful model based on the linear theory to assess whether this discrepancy points toward deviations from $\textit{Planck}$. Focusing on scales $10&amp;lt;R&amp;lt;30$ $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$, we model the amplitudes of clustering and lensing of BOSS LOWZ galaxies using three parameters: galaxy bias $b_\mathrm{g}$, galaxy-matter cross-correlation coefficient $r_\mathrm{gm}$, and $A$, defined as the ratio between the true and $\textit{Planck}$ values of $\sigma_8$.</description>

Detection of hard X-ray spectrum from the kilo-parsec scale jet of active galactic nuclei cannot be accounted to the synchrotron emission mechanism from the electron distribution responsible for the radio/optical emission. Alternate explanations are the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons (IC/CMB) or synchrotron emission from a second electron population. When the X-ray emission is interpreted as IC/CMB process, the Compton spectrum peak at GeV energy and were predicted to be the Fermi candidate sources.</description>

The characteristic signatures of massive neutrinos on large-scale structure (LSS), if fully captured, can be used to put a stringent constraint on their mass sum, $M_{\nu}$. Previous work utilizing N-body simulations has shown the Minkowski functionals (MFs) of LSS can reveal the imprints of massive neutrinos on LSS, provide important complementary information to two-point statistics and significantly improve constraints on $M_{\nu}$. In this work, we take a step forward and apply the statistics to the biased tracers of LSS, i.</description>

We use the hydrodynamic EAGLE simulation to predict the numbers and masses of supermassive black holes in stripped nuclei and compare these to confirmed measurements of black holes in observed UCDs. We find that black holes in stripped nuclei are consistent with the numbers and masses of those in observed UCDs. Approximately 50 per cent of stripped nuclei with $M &amp;gt; 2 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ should contain supermassive black holes.</description>

Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) merging in dwarf galaxies will be detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) in the mid-2030s. Previous cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have shown the prediction of massive black holes merging in dwarf galaxies, but these simulations are limited by their resolution and cannot follow black hole pairs all the way to coalescence. We calculate the delay time between black hole pairing and merger based on the properties of the black holes and their host galaxies, and use these properties to calculate gravitational wave strains for eleven different binary black holes that merge inside dwarf galaxies from eight cosmological simulations.</description>

The abundance, temperature, and clustering of metals in the intergalactic medium are important parameters for understanding their cosmic evolution and quantifying their impact on cosmological analysis with the Ly $\alpha$ forest. The properties of these systems are typically measured from individual quasar spectra redward of the quasar&amp;rsquo;s Ly $\alpha$ emission line, yet that approach may provide biased results due to selection effects. We present an alternative approach to measure these properties in an unbiased manner with the two-point statistics commonly employed to quantify large-scale structure.</description>

Stars are fossils that retain the history of their host galaxies. Elements heavier than helium are created inside stars and are ejected when they die. From the spatial distribution of elements in galaxies, it is therefore possible to constrain the physical processes during galaxy formation and evolution. This approach, Galac- tic archaeology, has been popularly used for our Milky Way Galaxy with a vast amount of data from Gaia satellite and multi-object spectrographs to understand the origins of sub-structures of the Milky Way.</description>

      <description>First author: Antoine Rocher
The halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework is an empirical method to describe the connection between dark matter halos and galaxies, which is constrained by small scale clustering data. Efficient fitting procedures are required to scan the HOD parameter space. This paper describes such a method based on Gaussian Processes to iteratively build a surrogate model of the posterior of the likelihood surface from a reasonable amount of likelihood computations, typically two orders of magnitude less than standard Monte Carlo Markov chain algorithms.</description>

      <description>First author: Leonardo Giani
We investigate the cosmological implications of an effective gravitational action, inspired by Sakharov&amp;rsquo;s idea of induced gravity, containing non-local contributions from the operator $\left(\Box +\beta \right)^{-1} R$. The $\beta$ term is a novel feature in the panorama of non-local models of gravity, and arises naturally within Sakharov theory from the potential of a non-minimally coupled scalar field after a spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place. In this class of models the non-local contribution can acquire an oscillatory behaviour, thereby avoiding the divergence of the Hubble parameter at late times, which is another characteristic feature of the non-local models treated in the literature.</description>

      <description>First author: Sandro Tacchella
We present JWST NIRCam 9-band near-infrared imaging of the luminous $z=10.6$ galaxy GN-z11 from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of the GOODS-N field. We find a spectral energy distribution (SED) entirely consistent with the expected form of a high-redshift galaxy: a clear blue continuum from 1.5 to 4 microns with a complete dropout in F115W. The core of GN-z11 is extremely compact in JWST imaging.</description>

We present JADES JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GN-z11, the most luminous candidate $z&amp;gt;10$ Lyman break galaxy in the GOODS-North field with $M_{UV}=-21.5$. We derive a redshift of $z=10.603$ (lower than previous determinations) based on multiple emission lines in our low and medium resolution spectra over $0.8-5.3,\mu$m. We significantly detect the continuum and measure a blue rest-UV spectral slope of $\beta=-2.4$. Remarkably, we see spatially-extended Lyman-$\alpha$ in emission (despite the highly-neutral IGM expected at this early epoch), offset 555 km/s redward of the systemic redshift.</description>

(Abridged) In this article, we discuss the state of AGN feedback&#39;&#39; in radio-quiet (RQ) AGN. This study involves heterogeneous samples of nearby Seyfert and LINER galaxies as well as QSOs that have been observed at low radio frequencies (few ~100 MHz) with the GMRT and ~GHz frequencies with the VLA and VLBA. These multi-frequency, multi-resolution observations detect a range of arcsecond-scale radio spectral indices that are consistent with the presence of multiple contributors including starburst winds and AGN jets or winds; steep spectrum relic&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; emission is observed as well.</description>

We report a new test of modified gravity theories using the large-scale structure of the Universe. This paper is the first attempt to (1) apply a joint analysis of the anisotropic components of galaxy two- and three-point correlation functions (2 and 3PCFs) to actual galaxy data and (2) constrain the nonlinear effects of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories on cosmological scales. Applying this analysis to the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12, we obtain the lower bounds of $-1.</description>

We propose a non-exotic electromagnetic solution to the cosmological $^7$Li problem based upon a 2 MeV photo-emission line from color superconducting quark nuggets (CSCQN) that destroys Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) $^7$Be without affecting other abundances or Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) physics. Conversion of CSCQN gluonic (rest-mass) energy to 2 MeV photons in the radiation-dominated post-BBN epoch reduces the primordial abundance of $^7$Be (and thus cosmological $^7$Li) by 2/3, provided the combined mass of the nuggets is greater than the total baryonic mass in the Universe.</description>

      <description>Shota L. Yokoyama
It is expected that cosmic rays (CRs) escape from high-redshift galaxies at redshift $z\sim 10 \, - \, 20$ because CRs are accelerated by supernova remnants of the first stars. Although ultraviolet and X-ray photons are widely considered the main source of heating of the intergalactic medium, CRs can also contribute to it. When the CRs propagate in the intergalactic medium, in addition to the heating process due to CR ionization, resistive heating occurs due to the electron return current induced by the streaming CRs.</description>

Blind cleaning methods are currently the preferred strategy for handling foreground contamination in single-dish HI intensity mapping surveys. Despite the increasing sophistication of blind techniques, some signal loss will be inevitable across all scales. Constructing a corrective transfer function using mock signal injection into the contaminated data has been a practice relied on for HI intensity mapping experiments. However, assessing whether this approach is viable for future intensity mapping surveys where precision cosmology is the aim, remains unexplored.</description>

We present JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Spectrograph rest-frame optical data of the compact $z=5.55$ galaxy GS_3073. Its prominent broad components in several hydrogen and helium lines (while absent in the forbidden lines), and the detection of a large equivalent width of He II $\lambda4686$, EW(He II) $\sim20$ Angstrom, unambiguously identify it as an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We measure a gas-phase metallicity of $Z_{\rm gas}/Z_\odot\sim0.21^{+0.08}{-0.04}$, lower than what has been inferred for both more luminous AGN at similar redshift and lower redshift AGN.</description>

Furthermore, the accuracy of distances estimated using the $\Sigma$-D relation is examined. The arithmetic mean of the Galactic SNR diameters is $30.5$ pc with standard error $1.7$ pc and standard deviation $25.4$ pc.

The 21-cm power spectrum of reionization is a promising probe for cosmology and fundamental physics. Exploiting this new observable, however, requires fast predictors capable of efficiently scanning the very large parameter space of cosmological and astrophysical uncertainties. In this paper, we introduce the halo model of reionization (HMreio), a new analytical tool that combines the halo model of the cosmic dawn with the excursion-set bubble model for reionization, assuming an empirical correction factor to deal with overlapping ionization bubbles.</description>

Context. The existence of magnetic fields in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is largely unconstrained. Their detection is important as magnetic fields can have a significant impact on the evolution of the CGM and, in turn, the fields can serve as tracers for dynamical processes in the CGM. Aims. With Faraday rotation of polarised background sources, we aim to detect a possible excess of the rotation measure in the surrounding area of nearby galaxies.</description>

Dwarf galaxies are characterised by a very low luminosity and low mass. Because of significant accretion and ejection activity of massive black holes, some dwarf galaxies also host low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In a few dwarf AGNs, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations have found faint non-thermal radio emission. SDSS J090613.77+561015.2 is a dwarf AGN owning an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of $M_{BH} = 3.</description>

Single field inflationary models are investigated within Palatini quadratic gravity represented by $R+\alpha R^2$ along with a non-minimal coupling of the form $f(\phi) R$ between the inflaton field $\phi$ and the gravity. The treatment is performed in the Einstein frame, where the minimal coupling to gravity is recovered through conformal transformation. We consider various limits of the model with different inflationary scenarios characterized as canonical slow-roll inflation in the limit $\alpha \dot{\phi}^2\ll (1+f(\phi)) $, constant-roll k-inflation for $\alpha \ll 1$, and slow-roll K-inflation for$ \alpha \gg 1$ .</description>

The assembly history of the Milky Way (MW) is a rapidly evolving subject, with numerous small accretion events and at least one major merger proposed in the MW&amp;amp;#39;s history. Accreted alongside these dwarf galaxies are globular clusters (GCs), which act as spatially coherent remnants of these past events. Using high precision differential abundance measurements from our recently published study, we investigate the likelihood that the MW clusters NGC 362 and NGC 288 are galactic siblings, accreted as part of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger.</description>

We construct an improved spatial birth-death-move MCMC algorithm to make inferences about the locations of these otherwise un-observable galaxies. Our novel models significantly out-perform existing approaches based on the Log-Gaussian Cox Process; the novel marked point process we propose can also improve the detection performance for UDGs in noisy environments.</description>

The distribution of the spin directions of spiral galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has been a topic of debate in the past two decades, with conflicting conclusions reported even in cases where the same data was used. Here we follow one of the previous experiments by applying the SpArcFiRe algorithm to annotate the spin directions in original dataset of Galaxy Zoo 1. The annotation of the galaxy spin directions is done after a first step of selecting the spiral galaxies in three different manners: manual analysis by Galaxy Zoo classifications, by a model-driven computer analysis, and with no selection of spiral galaxies.</description>

How elliptical galaxies form is a key question in observational cosmology. While the formation of massive ellipticals is strongly linked to mergers, the low mass (Mstar &amp;lt; 10^9.5 MSun) regime remains less well explored. In particular, studying elliptical populations when they are blue, and therefore rapidly building stellar mass, offers strong constraints on their formation. Here, we study 108 blue, low-mass ellipticals (which have a median stellar mass of 10^8.</description>

      <description>First author: Chris Hamilton
Spiral density waves can arise in galactic disks as linear instabilities of the underlying stellar distribution function. Such instabilities grow exponentially in amplitude at some fixed growth rate $\beta$ before saturating nonlinearly. However, the mechanisms behind nonlinear saturation, and the resulting saturated spiral amplitude, have not received much attention. Here we argue that the most important nonlinear saturation mechanism is likely trapping of stars near the spiral&amp;rsquo;s corotation resonance.</description>

Thanks to the superb image quality and wide area coverage of the Sextans field, the HSC data enables a secure selection of member star candidates based on the colour-magnitude cut, yielding about 10,000 member candidates at magnitudes down to $i\sim 24$.</description>

The observed properties of galaxies are strongly dependent on both their total stellar mass and their morphology. Furthermore, the environment is known to play a strong role in shaping them. The galaxy population in the local universe that is located in virialized clusters is found to be red, poorly star-forming, and mostly composed of early morphological types. Towards a holistic understanding of the mechanisms that drive galaxy evolution, we exploit the spectrophotometric data from the WINGS and OmegaWINGS local galaxy cluster surveys, and study the role of both the local and the large-scale environments.</description>

      <description>First author: A. Acharyya
Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a rare class of stellar explosions with luminosities ~10-100 times greater than ordinary core-collapse supernovae. One popular model to explain the enhanced optical output of hydrogen-poor (Type I) SLSNe invokes energy injection from a rapidly spinning magnetar. A prediction in this case is that high-energy gamma rays, generated in the wind nebula of the magnetar, could escape through the expanding supernova ejecta at late times (months or more after optical peak).</description>

      <description>Akira Tokiwa
We use the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data to study structural parameters and systemic proper motion of the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy at the heliocentric distance of 86 kpc, which is one of the most important targets for studies of dark matter nature and galaxy formation physics. Thanks to the superb image quality and wide area coverage of the Sextans field, the HSC data enables a secure selection of member star candidates based on the colour-magnitude cut, yielding about 10,000 member candidates at magnitudes down to $i\sim 24$.</description>

The goal of this work is to search for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the Galactic disc at very low latitudes with |b| $&amp;lt;$ 2$^\circ$. For this, we studied the five sources from the VVV near-infrared galaxy catalogue that have also WISE counterparts and present variability in the VIrac VAriable Classification Ensemble (VIVACE) catalogue. In the near-infrared colour-colour diagrams, these objects have in general redder colours compared to the rest of the sources in the field.</description>

Aim. The satellite systems of Milky-Way-like galaxies offer a useful means by which to study the galaxy formation process in the cosmological context. It has been suggested that the currently observed anisotropic distribution of the satellites in such galaxy systems is inconsistent with the concordant $\Lambda CDM$ cosmology model on the galactic scale if the observed satellites are random samples of the dark matter (DM) sub-halos that are nearly isotropically distributed around the central galaxy.</description>

We report the discovery of a new stream (dubbed as Yangtze) detected in $Gaia$ Data Release 3. The stream is at a heliocentric distance of $\sim$ 9.12 kpc and spans nearly 27$¬∞$ by 1.9$¬∞$ on sky. The colour-magnitude diagram of Yangtze indicates a stellar population of Age $\sim$ 11 Gyr and $[M/H]$ $\sim$ -0.7 dex. It has a number density of about 5.5 stars degree$^{-2}$ along with a surface brightness of $Œ£_G \simeq$ 34.</description>

Interstellar dust captures a significant fraction of elements heavier than helium in the solid state and is an indispensable component both in theory and observations of galaxy evolution. Dust emission is generally the primary coolant of the interstellar medium (ISM) and facilitates the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of gas clouds from which stars form, while altering the emission spectrum of galaxies from ultraviolet (UV) to far-infrared wavelengths through the reprocessing of starlight.</description>

We study the potential of the galaxy cluster sample expected from the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) survey to constrain dark energy properties. By modelling the distribution of observed cluster mass for a given true mass to be log-normal and adopting a selection threshold in the observed mass $M_{200m} \geq 0.836 \times 10^{14} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, we find about $4.1 \times 10^{5}$ clusters in the redshift range $0 \leq z \leq 1.</description>

We recently introduced a new method for simulating collisional gravitational N-body systems with approximately linear time scaling with $N$, based on the Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) scheme, previously applied in Plasma Physics. We simulate globular clusters with a realistic number of stellar particles (at least up to several times $10^6$) on a standard workstation. We simulate clusters hosting an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH), probing a broad range of BH-cluster and BH-average-star mass ratios, unrestricted by the computational constraints affecting direct N-body codes.</description>

Spectroscopic reverberation mapping (RM) is a direct approach widely used to estimate the mass of black holes (BHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, it is very time-consuming and difficult to apply to a large AGN sample. The empirical relation between the broad-line region (BLR) size and luminosity (H$\beta$ $R_{\rm BLR}\unicode{x2013}L_{\rm}$) provides a practical alternative yet subject to large scatter and systematic bias. AGN continuum RM (CRM) recently discovered a similar relation between the continuum emitting region (CER) size and luminosity ($R_{\rm CER}\unicode{x2013}L$).</description>

We investigate the cosmological constraints that can be expected from measurement of the cross-correlation of galaxies with cosmic voids identified in the Euclid spectroscopic survey, which will include spectroscopic information for tens of millions of galaxies over $15,000$ deg$^2$ of the sky in the redshift range $0.9\leq z&amp;lt;1.8$. We do this using simulated measurements obtained from the Flagship mock catalogue, the official Euclid mock that closely matches the expected properties of the spectroscopic data set.</description>

In this Letter, we report the outcomes of 1-D modelling of a rotating 25 M$_{\odot}$ zero-age main-sequence Population III star up to the stage of the onset of core collapse. Rapidly rotating models display violent and sporadic mass losses after the Main-Sequence stage. In comparison to the solar metallicity model, Pop III models show very small pre-supernova radii. Further, with models at the stage of the onset of core collapse, we simulate the hydrodynamic simulations of resulting supernovae.</description>

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are explosions of white dwarf stars that facilitate exquisite measurements of cosmological expansion history, but improvements in accuracy and precision are hindered by observational biases. Of particular concern is the apparent difference in the corrected brightnesses of SNe Ia in different host galaxy environments. SNe Ia in more massive, passive, older environments appear brighter after having been standardized by their light-curve properties.</description>

We study the bar pattern speeds and corotation radii of 225 barred galaxies, using IFU data from MaNGA and the Tremaine-Weinberg method. Our sample, which is divided between strongly and weakly barred galaxies identified via Galaxy Zoo, is the largest that this method has been applied to. We find lower pattern speeds for strongly barred galaxies than for weakly barred galaxies. As simulations show that the pattern speed decreases as the bar exchanges angular momentum with its host, these results suggest that strong bars are more evolved than weak bars.</description>

We present jax-cosmo, a library for automatically differentiable cosmological theory calculations. It uses the JAX library, which has created a new coding ecosystem, especially in probabilistic programming. As well as batch acceleration, just-in-time compilation, and automatic optimization of code for different hardware modalities (CPU, GPU, TPU), JAX exposes an automatic differentiation (autodiff) mechanism. Thanks to autodiff, jax-cosmo gives access to the derivatives of cosmological likelihoods with respect to any of their parameters, and thus enables a range of powerful Bayesian inference algorithms, otherwise impractical in cosmology, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Variational Inference.</description>

The correlation between the kinetic jet power $P_{\rm jet}$, intrinsic $\gamma$-ray luminosity ($L^{\rm int}$) and accretion ($L_{\rm disk}$) may reveal the underlying jet physics in various black hole systems. We study the relation between kinetic jet power, intrinsic $\gamma$-ray luminosity, and accretion by using a large sample of jetted AGN, including flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), gamma-ray Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies ($\gamma$NLS1s) and radio galaxies.</description>

This is the second paper in a series whose aim is to predict the power spectrum of intensity and polarized intensity from cosmic reionization fronts. After building the analytic models for intensity and polarized intensity calculations in paper I, here we apply these models to simulations of reionization. We construct a geometric model for identifying front boundaries, calculate the intensity and polarized intensity for each front, and compute a power spectrum of these results.</description>

In this paper, we present the formalism of simulating Lyman-$Œ±$ emission and polarization around reionization ($z$ = 8) from a plane-parallel ionization front. We accomplish this by using a Monte Carlo method to simulate the production of a Lyman-$Œ±$ photon, its propagation through an ionization front, and the eventual escape of this photon. This paper focuses on the relation of the input parameters of ionization front speed $U$, blackbody temperature $T_{\rm bb}$, and neutral hydrogen density $n_{\rm HI}$, on intensity $I$ and polarized intensity $P$ as seen by a distant observer.</description>

We study three different extended scalar-tensor theories of gravity by also allowing a negative sign for the kinetic term for the scalar field in the Jordan frame. Our scope is to understand how the observational constraints for these models cope with the volume of the parameter space in which the theory is healthy. Models with a negative kinetic term lead to decreasing effective gravitational constant with redshift and behave as an effective relativistic component with a negative energy density as opposite to their corresponding version with a standard kinetic term.</description>

We use the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5 year catalogue of photometrically-classified type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to identify 70 SNe Ia that have occurred within red-sequence selected clusters of galaxies. We compare the cluster SN light-curve properties and environmental properties to 1020 DES SNe Ia located in the field, the largest comparison of two such samples to date. We find an tentative indication (98.5 per cent confidence level) that, on average, SNe Ia located in galaxy clusters are faster declining compared to those located in the field.</description>

Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are among the most massive galaxies in the Universe. Their star formation (SF) history and stellar mass assembly are debated. Recent studies suggest the presence of an emerging population of intermediate-$z$ star forming and gas-rich BCGs, where the molecular gas reservoirs are impacted by strong environmental processing. We have selected three among the most star-forming $z\sim0.4$ BCGs in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and observed them with the IRAM 30m telescope in the first three CO transitions.</description>

We present a comprehensive catalog of observations and stellar population properties for 23 highly secure host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Our sample comprises six repeating FRBs and 17 apparent non-repeaters. We present 82 new photometric and eight new spectroscopic observations of these hosts. Using stellar population synthesis modeling and employing non-parametric star formation histories (SFHs), we find that FRB hosts have a median stellar mass of $\approx 10^{9.</description>

      <description>First author: P. A. Chernikov
In the presented work we consider the influence of a hypothetical sterile neutrino (with eV-scale mass) on the determination of cosmological parameters. If it is detected, it will be necessary to include it into the $\Lambda \rm CDM$ model with the fixed values of its mass $m_{\rm s}$ and mixing angle $\theta_{s}$, which is the main method used through this paper. Apart from that, the seesaw mechanism requires there to be at least two sterile states, one of them being much heavier than the active ones.</description>

With the calculated guiding center radius $R_{guiding}$ and birth radius $R_{birth}$, we investigate the role of radial migration on the description of lithium evolution in the Galactic disk based on the upper envelope of the A(Li) vs. $[Fe/H]$ diagram. Using migration distances, we find that stars in the solar neighborhood are born at different locations in the galactic disk, and cannot all be explained by models of chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood.</description>

Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) with JWST NIRSpec will significantly improve our understanding of the first quasars, by providing spatially resolved, infrared spectroscopic capabilities which cover key rest-frame optical emission lines that have been previously unobservable. Here we present our results from the first two z&amp;gt;6 quasars observed as a part of the NIRSpec Galaxy Assembly IFS GTO program, DELS J0411-0907 at z=6.82 and VDES J0020-3653 at z=6.</description>

      <description>First author: Anderson Caproni
Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations are commonly used to study the evolution of the gaseous content in isolated galaxies, besides its connection with galactic star formation histories. Stellar winds, supernova blasts, and black hole feedback are mechanisms usually invoked to drive galactic outflows and decrease the initial galactic gas reservoir. However, any simulation imposes the need of choosing the limits of the simulated volume, which depends, for instance, on the size of the galaxy and the required numerical resolution, besides the available computational capability to perform it.</description>

The phenomenon of cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) is expected to occur during the period of inflation and the transition into a hot big bang cosmology. Particles may be produced even if they only couple directly to gravity, and so CGPP provides a natural explanation for the origin of dark matter. In this work we study the gravitational production of massive spin-2 particles assuming two different couplings to matter.</description>

We present a framework for self-consistent cosmological analyses of the full-shape anisotropic bispectrum, including the quadrupole $(\ell=2)$ and hexadecapole $(\ell=4)$ moments. This features a novel window-free algorithm for extracting the latter quantities from data, derived using a maximum-likelihood prescription. Furthermore, we introduce a theoretical model for the bispectrum multipoles (which does not introduce new free parameters), and test both aspects of the pipeline on several high-fidelity mocks, including the PT Challenge suite of gigantic cumulative volume.</description>

      <description>Edoardo Altamura
Recent high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with a variety of codes systematically predict large amounts of entropy in the intra-cluster medium at low redshift, leading to flat entropy profiles and a suppressed cool-core population. This prediction is at odds with X-ray observations of groups and clusters. We use a new implementation of the EAGLE galaxy formation model to investigate the sensitivity of the central entropy and the shape of the profiles to changes in the sub-grid model applied to a suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations of a group of mass $M_{500} = 8.</description>

Kilo-parsec scale hard ($&amp;gt;$ 3 keV) X-ray continuum and fluorescent Fe K$\alpha$ line emission has been recently discovered in nearby Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nuclei (AGN), which opens new opportunities to improve AGN torus modeling and investigate how the central supermassive black hole interacts with and impacts the host galaxy. Following a pilot Chandra survey of nearby CT AGN, we present in this paper the Chandra spatial analysis results of five uniformly selected non-CT but still heavily obscured AGN to investigate the extended hard X-ray emission by measuring the excess emission counts, excess fractions, and physical scales.</description>

      <description>First author: Corey Brummel-Smith
Early photometric results from JWST have revealed a number of galaxy candidates above redshift 10. The initial estimates of inferred stellar masses and the associated cosmic star formation rates are above most theoretical model predictions up to a factor of 20 in the most extreme cases, while this has been moderated after the recalibration of NIRCam and subsequent spectroscopic detections. Using these recent JWST observations, we use galaxy scaling relations from cosmological simulations to model the star formation history to very high redshifts, back to a starting halo mass of 10^7 solar masses, to infer the intrinsic properties of the JWST galaxies.</description>

With mock strong gravitational lensing images, we investigate the performance of broken power-law (BPL) model on the mass reconstruction of galaxy-scale lenses. An end-to-end test is carried out, including the creation of mock strong lensing images, the subtraction of lens light, and the reconstruction of lensed images. Based on these analyses, we can reliably evaluate how accurate the lens mass and source light distributions can be measured.</description>

We search for signatures of recent galaxy close interactions and mergers in a sample of 202 early-type galaxies in the local universe from the public SDSS Stripe82 deep images ($Œº_r \sim 28.5$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$). Using two different methods to remove galaxies&amp;amp;#39; smooth and symmetric light distribution, we identify and characterize eleven distinct types of merger remnants embedded in the diffuse light of these early-type galaxies. We discuss how the morphology of merger remnants can result from different kinds of minor and major mergers, and estimate the fraction of early-type galaxies in the local universe with evidence of recent major (27%) and minor (57%) mergers.</description>

We demonstrate how the stellar and nebular conditions in star-forming galaxies modulate the emission and spectral profile of HI Lya emission line. We examine the net Lya output, kinematics, and in particular emission of blue-shifted Lya radiation, using spectroscopy from with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on HST, giving a sample of 87 galaxies at redshift z=0.05-0.44. We contrast the Lya spectral measurements with properties of the ionized gas (from optical spectra) and stars (from stellar modeling).</description>

Globular clusters display an anticorrelation between the fraction of the first generation of stars ($N({\rm G1})/N({\rm tot})$) and the slope of the present-day mass function of the clusters ($Œ±_{pd}$), which is particularly significant for massive clusters. In the framework of the binary-mediated collision scenario for the formation of the second-generation stars in globular clusters, we test the effect of a varying stellar initial mass function (IMF) of the G1 stars on the $(N({\rm G1})/N({\rm tot}))-Œ±_{pd}$ anticorrelation.</description>

      <description>First author: Danielle Dickinson
We present a series of ground-based photometry and spectroscopy of the superluminous Type IIn supernova (SN) ASASSN-15ua, which shows evidence for strong interaction with pre-existing dense circumstellar material (CSM). Our observations constrain the speed, mass-loss rate, and extent of the progenitor wind shortly before explosion. A narrow P Cygni absorption component reveals a progenitor wind speed of $\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$. As observed in previous SNe IIn, the intermediate-width H$\alpha$ emission became progressively more asymmetric and blueshifted, suggesting either an asymmetric CSM, an asymmetric explosion, or increasing selective extinction from dust within the post-shock shell or SN ejecta.</description>

Neutrinos allow the probing of stellar interiors during core collapse, helping to understand the different stages and processes in the collapse. To date, supernova neutrinos have only been detected from a single event, SN1987A. Most studies from then on have focused on two distance extremes: Galactic/local supernovae and all past cosmic supernovae forming the diffuse supernova neutrino background. We focus on the intermediate distance regime as a target for detecting core-collapse supernova neutrinos at next generation detectors like Hyper-Kamiokande.</description>

Characterizing the physical conditions (density, temperature, ionization state, metallicity, etc) of the interstellar medium is critical to our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies. Here we present a multi-line study of the interstellar medium in the host galaxy of a quasar at z~6.4, i.e., when the universe was 840 Myr old. This galaxy is one of the most active and massive objects emerging from the dark ages, and therefore represents a benchmark for models of the early formation of massive galaxies.</description>

This is the first submillimeter maser detection in a radio galaxy and the most luminous 321-GHz H$2$O maser known to date with the isotropic luminosity of 1090 $L{\odot}$. The line profile consists of a broad velocity component with FWHM $= 208 \pm 12$ km s$^{-1}$ straddling the systemic velocity and a narrow component with FWHM $= 44 \pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$ blueshifted by 160 km s$^{-1}$.</description>

We investigate the radial distribution of O, Ne, Mg, Si, Ar, S, Ca, Ni and Fe. We found that the best-fit model is close to a single-temperature component for distances $&amp;gt;80$~kpc and the cooler gas is more metal-rich.</description>

The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is very useful for processing signals with intricate and irregular structures in astrophysics and cosmology.

In this work, we review and compare four different fast CWT algorithms for the 1D signals, including the FFTCWT, the V97CWT, the M02CWT, and the A19CWT. The FFTCWT algorithm implements the CWT using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\log_2N)$ per scale.</description>

Detailed observations of the present contents of the universe are consistent with the Cosmological Constant Lambda and Cold Dark Matter model, subject to some unresolved inconsistencies (&amp;rsquo;tensions&amp;rsquo;) among observations of the Hubble Constant and the clumpiness factor. To understand these issues further, large surveys of billions of galaxies and other probes require new statistical approaches.</description>

We examine variations in the concentration index, radius, and color gradient of ETGs as a function of their stellar mass and loci in the projected phase space (PPS) of the clusters. We aim to understand the environmental influence on the growth of ETGs according to the time since infall into their host clusters.</description>

      <description>First author: Danila Korytov
The galaxy distribution in dark matter-dominated halos is expected to approximately trace the details of the underlying dark matter substructure. In this paper we introduce halo `core-tracking&amp;rsquo; as a way to efficiently follow the small-scale substructure in cosmological simulations and apply the technique to model the galaxy distribution in observed clusters. The method relies on explicitly tracking the set of particles identified as belonging to a halo&amp;rsquo;s central density core, once a halo has attained a certain threshold mass.</description>

We investigate the sensitivity of a universe&amp;rsquo;s nuclear entropy after Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) to variations in both the baryon-to-photon ratio and the temporal evolution of cosmological expansion. Specifically, we construct counterfactual cosmologies to quantify the degree by which these two parameters must vary from those in our Universe before we observe a substantial change in the degree of fusion, and thus nuclear entropy, during BBN.</description>

      <description>Mario Romero
We present a self-consistent prediction of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF), from the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) to sub-mm range, based on two chemical evolution models of a Milky Way-like galaxy (MWG). To this end, we develop a new tool called Mixclask to include gas emission, absorption and scattering from the photoionization code Cloudy into the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Skirt. Both algorithms are invoked iteratively, until the physical properties of the ISM converge.</description>

      <description>Yuka Doke
One of the most intriguing properties of the GD-1 stellar stream is the existence of three gaps. If these gaps were formed by close encounters with dark matter subhalos, the GD-1 stream opens an exciting window through which we can see the size, mass, and velocity distributions of the dark matter subhalos in the Milky Way. However, in order to use the GD-1 stream as a probe of the dark matter substructure, we need to disprove that these gaps are not due to the perturbations from baryonic components of the Milky Way.</description>

We model the GI correlations in an N-body simulation with our recent accurate stellar-halo mass relation from the Photometric object Around Cosmic webs (PAC) method. The large data set and our accurate modeling turns out an accurate measurement of the alignment angle between central galaxies and their host halos.</description>

Nebular HeII$\lambda$4686\AA~line emission is useful to unveil active galactic nuclei (AGN) residing in actively star-forming (SF) galaxies, typically missed by the standard BPT classification. Here we adopt the HeII diagnostic to identify hidden AGN in the Local Universe using for the first time spatially-resolved data from the Data Release 15 of the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO survey (MaNGA DR15). By combining results from HeII and BPT diagnostics, we overall select 459 AGN host candidates ($\sim$10% in MaNGA DR15), out of which 27 are identified as AGN by the HeII diagram only.</description>

The amount of baryons hosted in the disks of galaxies is lower than expected based on the mass of their dark-matter halos and the fraction of baryon-to-total matter in the universe, giving rise to the so called galaxy missing-baryon problem. The presence of cool circum-galactic matter gravitationally bound to its galaxy&amp;rsquo;s halo up to distances of at least ten times the size of the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s disk, mitigates the problem but is far from being sufficient for its solution.</description>

Elliptical galaxies with blue optical colours and significant star formation are hypothesised to be major merger remnants of gas rich spiral galaxies or normal elliptical galaxies with a sudden burst of star formation. We present here a scenario where blue elliptical galaxies identified from shallow imaging surveys may fail to recover faint features indicative of a past merger activity using a nearby major merger remnant. Based on deep optical imaging data of a post merger galaxy, NGC 7252, we demonstrate that the galaxy can appear as an elliptical galaxy if observed at higher redshifts.</description>

We construct 3D emissivity maps of the $[Fe I]$ 1.443 $\mu$m line from the inner ejecta and the He I 1.083 $\mu$m line from the reverse shock (RS), where the former probes the explosion geometry and the latter traces the structure of the circumstellar medium.</description>

The next generation of space-based experiments will go hunting for answers to cosmology&amp;rsquo;s key open questions which revolve around inflation, dark matter and dark energy. Low earth orbit and lunar missions within the European Space Agency&amp;rsquo;s Human and Robotic Exploration programme can push our knowledge forward in all of these three fields. A radio interferometer on the Moon, a cold atom interferometer in low earth orbit and a gravitational wave interferometer on the Moon are highlighted as the most fruitful missions to plan and execute in the mid-term.</description>

Star formation and stellar feedback are interlinked processes that redistribute energy and matter throughout galaxies. When young, massive stars form in spatially clustered environments, they create pockets of expanding gas termed superbubbles. As these processes play a critical role in shaping galaxy discs and regulating the baryon cycle, measuring the properties of superbubbles provides important input for galaxy evolution models. With wide coverage and high angular resolution ($\sim$50-150 pc) of the PHANGS-ALMA $^{12}$CO (2-1) survey, we can now resolve and identify a statistically representative number of superbubbles with molecular gas in nearby galaxies.</description>

Thin stellar discs on both galactic and nuclear, sub-kpc scales are believed to be fragile structures that would be easily destroyed in major mergers. In turn, this makes the age-dating of their stellar populations a useful diagnostics for the assembly history of galaxies. We aim at carefully exploring the fragility of such stellar discs in intermediate- and low- mass encounters, using high-resolution N-body simulations of galaxy models with structural and kinematic properties tailored to actually observed galaxies.</description>

Recent models for the inner structure of active galactic nuclei (AGN) advocate the presence of a radiatively accelerated, dusty outflow launched from the outer regions of the accretion disk. Here we present the first near-infrared (near-IR) variable (rms) spectrum for the high-luminosity, nearby AGN Mrk 876. We find that it tracks the accretion disk spectrum out to longer wavelengths than the mean spectrum due to a reduced dust emission.</description>

We use the BOSS DR12 galaxy power spectrum to constrain compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIP), which are opposite-sign primordial baryon and dark matter perturbations that leave the total matter density unchanged. Long-wavelength CIP $\sigma(\vec{x})$ enter the galaxy density contrast as $\delta_g(\vec{x}) \supset b_\sigma\sigma(\vec{x})$, with $b_\sigma$ the linear CIP galaxy bias parameter. We parameterize the CIP spectra as $P_{\sigma\sigma} = A^2P_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}}$ and $P_{\sigma\mathcal{R}} = \xi\sqrt{P_{\sigma\sigma}P_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}}}$, where $A$ is the CIP amplitude and $\xi$ is the correlation with the curvature perturbations $\mathcal{R}$.</description>

We report the second extragalactic pulsar wind nebula (PWN) to be detected in the MeV-GeV band by the Fermi-LAT, located within the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The only other known PWN to emit in the Fermi band outside of the Milky Way Galaxy is N 157B which lies to the west of the newly detected gamma-ray emission at an angular distance of 4 degrees. Faint, point-like gamma-ray emission is discovered at the location of the composite supernova remnant (SNR) B0453-685 with a ~ 4 sigma significance from energies 300 MeV - 2 TeV.</description>

Models of radio galaxy physics have been primarily based on high frequency ($\geqslant$1 GHz) observations of their jets, hotspots, and lobes. Without highly resolved low frequency observations, which provide information on older plasma, our understanding of the dynamics of radio galaxies and their interaction with their environment is limited. Here, we present the first sub-arcsecond (0.3&amp;quot;) resolution images at 144 MHz of two powerful radio galaxies situated in rich cluster environments, namely 3C 34 and 3C 320, using the International Low Frequency Array Telescope.</description>

We present evidence for a suppressed growth rate of large-scale structure during the dark-energy dominated era. Modeling the growth rate of perturbations with the ``growth index&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; $\gamma$, we find that current cosmological data strongly prefer a higher growth index than the value $\gamma=0.55$ predicted by general relativity in a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Both the cosmic microwave background data from Planck and the large-scale structure data from weak lensing, galaxy clustering, and cosmic velocities separately favor growth suppression.</description>

We develop a new model within which the radius-dependent transition of the galaxy inner spins with respect to the cosmic web and the variation of the transition threshold radius ($r_{\rm th}$) with galaxy mass ($M_{\rm vir}$), smoothing scale ($r_{f}$), and redshift ($z$) can be coherently explained. The key tenet of this model is that the competition between the pressure effect of the inner mass and the compression effect of the local tidal field determines which principal direction of the tidal field the inner spins are aligned with.</description>

Studies indicate strong evidence of a scaling relation in the local Universe between the supermassive black hole mass ($M_\rm{BH}$) and the stellar mass of their host galaxies ($M_\star$). They even show similar histories across cosmic times of their differential terms: star formation rate (SFR) and black hole accretion rate (BHAR). However, a clear picture of this coevolution is far from being understood. We select an X-ray sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) up to $z=2.</description>

      <description>First author: Carrie Filion
Many disc galaxies host galactic bars, which exert time-dependent, non-axisymmetric forces that can alter the orbits of stars. There should be both angle and radius-dependence in the resulting radial re-arrangement of stars (&amp;lsquo;radial mixing&amp;rsquo;) due to a bar; we present here novel results and trends through analysis of the joint impact of these factors. We use an N-body simulation to investigate the changes in the radial locations of star particles in a disc after a bar forms by quantifying the change in orbital radii in a series of annuli at different times post bar-formation.</description>

      <description>First author: Aaron Ouellette
We use topological summaries based on Betti curves to characterize the large-scale spatial distribution of simulated dark matter haloes and galaxies. Using the IllustrisTNG and CAMELS-SAM simulations, we show that the topology of the galaxy distribution is significantly different from the topology of the dark matter halo distribution. Further, there are significant differences between the distributions of star-forming and quiescent galaxies. These topological differences are broadly consistent across all simulations, while at the same time there are noticeable differences when comparing between different models.</description>

      <description>First author: Rados≈Çaw Wojtak
The currently used standardisation of type Ia supernovae results in Hubble residuals whose physical origin is unaccounted for. This poses a limitation to the accuracy and precision of distances that can be derived from supernova observations. Here, we present a complete physical interpretation of the Hubble residuals based on a novel Bayesian hierarchical model of type Ia supernovae in which latent variables describing intrinsic and extrinsic (dust related) supernova properties originate from two populations.</description>

      <description>First author: I. Georgantopoulos
We explore the properties of the host galaxies of X-ray selected AGN in the COSMOS field using the Chandra Legacy sample and the LEGA-C survey VLT optical spectra. Our main goal is to compare the relative ages of the host galaxies of the obscured and unobscured AGN by means of the calcium break Dn(4000) and the Hdelta Balmer line. The host galaxy ages are examined in conjunction with other properties such as the galaxy stellar mass, and star-formation rate as well as the AGN Eddington ratio.</description>

Low mass galaxies in the Local Group are dominated by dark matter and comprise the well studied dwarf Spheroidal&amp;quot; (dSph) class, with typical masses of $10^{9-10}M_\odot$ and also the equally numerous ultra faint dwarfs&amp;quot; (UFD), discovered recently, that are distinctly smaller and denser with masses of only $10^{7-8}M_\odot$. This bimodality amongst low mass galaxies contrasts with the scale free continuity expected for galaxies formed under gravity, as in the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model for heavy particles.</description>

      <description>Euclid Collaboration,
The photometric catalogue of galaxy clusters extracted from ESA Euclid data is expected to be very competitive for cosmological studies. Using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, we present systematic analyses simulating the expected weak lensing profiles from clusters in a variety of dynamic states and at wide range of redshifts. In order to derive cluster masses, we use a model consistent with the implementation within the Euclid Consortium of the dedicated processing function and find that, when jointly modelling mass and the concentration parameter of the Navarro-Frenk-White halo profile, the weak lensing masses tend to be, on average, biased low with respect to the true mass.</description>

We use an asteroseismology method to calculate the frequencies of gravitational waves in a long-term core-collapse supernova simulation, with a mass of 9.6 $M_\odot$. The simulation, which includes neutrino transport in general relativity is performed from core-collapse, bounce, explosion and cooling of protoneutron stars (PNSs) up to 20 s after the bounce self-consistently. Based on the hydrodynamics background, we calculate eigenmodes of the PNS oscillation through a perturbation analysis on fluid and metric.</description>

While the direct detection of the dark-matter particle remains very challenging, the nature of dark matter could be possibly constrained by comparing the observed abundance and properties of small-scale sub-galactic mass structures with predictions from the phenomenological dark-matter models, such as cold, warm or hot dark matter. Galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing provides a unique opportunity to search for tiny surface-brightness anomalies in the extended lensed images (i.</description>

We present new HCN and HCO$^+$ ($J$=3-2) images of the nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) NGC 3351, NGC 3627, and NGC 4321. The observations, obtained with the Morita ALMA Compact Array, have a spatial resolution of $\sim$290-440 pc and resolve the inner $R_\textrm{gal} \lesssim$ 0.6-1 kpc of the targets, as well as the southern bar end of NGC 3627. We complement this data set with publicly available images of lower excitation lines of HCN, HCO$^+$, and CO and analyse the behaviour of a representative set of line ratios: HCN(3-2)/HCN(1-0), HCN(3-2)/HCO$^+$(3-2), HCN(1-0)/CO(2-1), and HCN(3-2)/CO(2-1).</description>

We present an analytic model for the cool, $T \approx 10^4$ K, circumgalactic medium (CGM), describing the gas distribution, thermal and ionization state. Our model assumes (total) pressure equilibrium with the ambient warm/hot CGM, photoionization by the metagalactic radiation field, and allows for non-thermal pressure support, parametrized by the ratio of thermal pressures, $\eta = P_{\rm hot,th}/P_{\rm cool,th}$. We apply the model to the COS-Halos data set and find that a nominal model with $\eta = 3$, gas distribution out to $r \approx 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Keiya Hirashima
Small integration timesteps for a small fraction of short-timescale regions are bottlenecks for high-resolution galaxy simulations using massively parallel computing. This is an urgent issue that needs to be resolved for future higher-resolution galaxy simulations. One possible solution is to use an (approximate) Hamiltonian splitting method, in which only regions requiring small timesteps are integrated with small timesteps, separated from the entire galaxy. In particular, gas affected by supernova (SN) explosions often requires the smallest timestep in such a simulation.</description>

Ultra-stripped supernovae are different from other terminal explosions of massive stars, as they show little or no ejecta from the actual supernova event. They are thought to occur in massive binary systems after the exploding star has lost its surface through interactions with its companion. Such supernovae produce little to no kick, leading to the formation of a neutron star without loss of the binary companion, which itself may also evolve into another neutron star.</description>

The chemical composition of gas in galaxies can be measured in detail from absorption spectroscopy. By studying gas in galaxies in this way, it is possible to investigate the small and faint galaxies, which are the most numerous in the universe. In particular, the chemical distribution of gas in absorbing systems gives us insight into cycles of gas in and around galaxies. Here we study chemical enrichment within 64 Damped Lyman-alpha Absorption (DLA) systems between $1.</description>

      <description>First author: Federico Lelli
We study the dynamics of cold molecular gas in two main-sequence galaxies at cosmic noon (zC-488879 at $z\simeq1.47$ and zC-400569 at $z\simeq2.24$) using new high-resolution ALMA observations of multiple $^{12}$CO transitions. For zC-400569 we also re-analyze high-quality H$\alpha$ data from the SINS/zC-SINF survey. We find that (1) Both galaxies have regularly rotating CO disks and their rotation curves are flat out to $\sim$8 kpc contrary to previous results pointing to outer declines in the rotation speed $V_{\rm rot}$; (2) The intrinsic velocity dispersions are low ($\sigma_{\rm CO}\lesssim15$ km/s for CO and $\sigma_{\rm H\alpha}\lesssim37$ km/s for H$\alpha$) and imply $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_{\rm CO}\gtrsim17-22$ yielding no significant pressure support; (3) Mass models using HST images display a severe disk-halo degeneracy: models with inner baryon dominance and models with &amp;ldquo;cuspy&amp;rdquo; dark matter halos can fit the rotation curves equally well due to the uncertainties on stellar and gas masses; (4) Milgromian dynamics (MOND) can successfully fit the rotation curves with the same acceleration scale $a_0$ measured at $z\simeq0$.</description>

The shear measurement from DECaLS (Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey) provides an excellent opportunity for galaxy-galaxy lensing study with DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) galaxies, given the large ($\sim 9000$ deg$^2$) sky overlap. We explore this potential by combining the DESI 1% survey and DECaLS DR8. With $\sim 106$ deg$^2$ sky overlap, we achieve significant detection of galaxy-galaxy lensing for BGS and LRG as lenses. Scaled to the full BGS sample, we expect the statistical errors to improve from $18(12)%$ to a promising level of $2(1.</description>

Addressing the discrepancy between the late and early time measurements of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, and the so-called $S_8$ parameter has been a challenge in precision cosmology. Several models are present to address these tensions, but very few of them can do so simultaneously. In the past, we have suggested Banks-Zaks/Unparticles as an emergent Dark Energy model and claimed that it can ameliorate the Hubble tension.</description>

We report on the discovery of two low-luminosity, broad-line AGN at $z&amp;gt;5$ identified using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CEERS Survey. We detect broad H$\alpha$ emission from both sources, with FWHM of $2038\pm286$ and $1807\pm207$ km s$^{-1}$, resulting in black hole (BH) masses that are 1-2 dex below that of existing samples of luminous quasars at $z&amp;gt;5$. The first source, CEERS 1670 at $z=5.242$, is 2-3 dex fainter than known quasars at similar redshifts and was previously identified as a candidate low-luminosity AGN based on its rest-frame optical SED.</description>

In a sample of 220 CIV absorbers, we identify 143 LAEs connected to CIV gas within a line-of-sight separation ${\rm \pm 500,km,s^{-1}}$, equal to a detection rate of $36\pm 5$ per cent once we account for multiple LAEs connected to the same CIV absorber.</description>

      <description>First author: Esraa Ali Elkhateeb
In this work, we reconstruct the cosmological unified dark fluid model proposed previously by Elkhateeb \cite{Elkhateeb:2017oqy} in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. Utilizing the equivalence between the scalar-tensor theory and the $f(R)$ gravity theory, the scalar field for the dark fluid is obtained, whence the $f(R)$ function is extracted and its viability is discussed. The linear growth of matter perturbations on the low redshifts is studied in our constructed $f(R)$ function, and the results are in good agreement with those from the $\Lambda$CDM model for the dark universe.</description>

One of the few firm predictions of string theory is the existence of a massless scalar field coupled to gravity, the dilaton. In its presence, the value of the fundamental constants of the universe, such as the fine-structure constant, will vary with the time-dependent vacuum expectation value of this field, in direct violation of the Einstein Equivalence Principle. The \emph{runaway dilaton} proposed by Damour, Piazza, and Veneziano provides a physically motivated cosmological scenario which reconciles the existence of a massless dilaton with observations, while still providing non-standard and testable predictions.</description>

      <description>First author: Agnibha De Sarkar
We present a simple phenomenological model of hadronic interaction between protons accelerated in an old supernova remnant (SNR) and cold protons situated within the associated molecular clouds (MCs). The accelerated protons from the old SNR escaped the SNR shock front, and got injected into the MCs at an earlier time, producing ultra high energy gamma-rays and neutrinos through inelastic proton-proton interaction. We also take into account the acceleration and subsequent escape of electrons from the SNR shock front.</description>

The last decade has seen tremendous developments in gamma-ray astronomy with the extragalactic sky becoming highly populated by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This brief review highlights some of the progress in AGN research achieved over the years, and discusses exemplary advances in the theory and physics of gamma-ray loud AGNs, including black-hole magnetospheric processes, the physics of pc-scales jets, as well as particle acceleration and high-energy emission in the large-scale jets of AGNs.</description>

We present a study of the relation between the $[OIII]$ 5007A emission line width (sigma_{$[OIII]$}) and stellar velocity dispersion (sigma_{}), utilizing a sample of 740 type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with high-quality spectra at redshift z &amp;lt; 1.0. We find the broad correlation between the core component of $[OIII]$ emission line width (sigma_{$[OIII,core]$}) and sigma_{} with a scatter of 0.11~dex for the low redshift (z &amp;lt; 0.</description>

Despite the importance of AGN in galaxy evolution, accurate AGN identification is often challenging, as common AGN diagnostics can be confused by contributions from star formation and other effects (e.g., Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagrams). However, one promising avenue for identifying AGNs are coronal emission lines&amp;quot; (CLs&amp;quot;), which are highly ionized species of gas with ionization potentials $\ge$ 100 eV. These CLs may serve as excellent signatures for the strong ionizing continuum of AGN.</description>

The next generation of wide spectroscopic surveys such as Euclid will scan the sky in the near-infrared to obtain both photometry and spectroscopy. For this purpose, the Euclid telescope will rely on a Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instrument whose spectroscopic channel has been designed to operate in slitless configuration. This powerful and easy to operate configuration makes it possible to avoid any prior selection on the targeted galaxies while covering the entire field of view.</description>

Equations governing the evolution of a star involve multiple coupling constants. Thus, the time it spends as a main-sequence star can be expected to depend on whether or not such constants vary over the time scale of stellar evolution. When the star belongs to a globular cluster, the star&amp;amp;#39;s age cannot exceed that of the globular cluster, and the latter cannot exceed the age of the Universe.</description>

Spectral energy distribution (SED) models of galaxies at 0.3 &amp;lt;= z &amp;lt;= 2.5 were constructed to be processed by the Euclid spectroscopic channel simulator in order to investigate the Euclid Near- Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) capabilities. We developed a solid methodology to build a realistic and representative synthetic SED library of star-forming galaxies, including reliable emission line fluxes and widths. The construction of the SEDs consists in computing the continuum using the Bruzual &amp;amp; Charlot (2003) models, calling out SED fitting parameters available in publicly released multi-wavelength catalogues.</description>

JWST has now made it possible to probe the rest-frame optical line emission of high-redshift galaxies extending to z~9, and potentially beyond. To aid in the interpretation of these emerging constraints, in this work we explore predictions for $[OIII]$ emission in high-redshift galaxies using the First Light and Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES). We produce predictions for the $[OIII]$ luminosity function, its correlation with the UV luminosity, and the distribution of equivalent widths (EWs).</description>

High-spectral resolution observations of clusters of galaxies are a powerful tool to understand the physical processes taking place in these massive objects. Their hot multi-million-degree X-ray emitting cluster atmospheres, containing most of the baryons in these systems, are enriched to around 1/3 of the solar metallicity. Therefore, cluster spectra host a variety of spectral lines, in particular, the Fe-L complex around 1 keV typically emitted from cooler systems and Fe-K at 6.</description>

We report our analysis results for the globular cluster (GC) NGC~6341 (M92), as a millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1717$+$4308A has recently been reported found in this GC. The data used are from the Large Area Telescope onboard the {\it Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}. We detect $Œ≥$-ray pulsations of the MSP at a $4.4œÉ$ confidence level (the corresponding weighted H-test value is $\sim$28.4). This MSP, the fourth $Œ≥$-ray pulsar found in a GC, does not have significant off-pulse emission and has $Œ≥$-ray luminosity and efficiency $1.</description>

We employ the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model to study how the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) evolve during galaxy mergers. We conduct a pixel-by-pixel analysis of molecular gas properties in both the simulated control galaxies and galaxy major mergers. The simulated GMC-pixels in the control galaxies follow a similar trend in a diagram of velocity dispersion ($œÉ_v$) versus gas surface density ($Œ£_{\mathrm{mol}}$) to the one observed in local spiral galaxies in the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey.</description>

Given a \textit{model building} assumption on the (effective) equation of state (EoS) of the Universe, the Hubble constant $H_0$ arises as an integration constant when one solves the Friedmann equations. Therefore, while $H_0$ is \textit{mathematically} a constant, it need not be a constant \textit{observationally}, unless the EoS or model accurately describes the Universe. Building on earlier results, we show that redshift evolution of flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters $(H_0, \Omega_{m})$ persists in the most up-to-date Pantheon+ sample.</description>

Five stars in the extreme outskirts (from $\sim5$ to $\sim12$ elliptical half-light radii, r$_h$) of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf galaxy have been identified as potential new members using a Bayesian algorithm applied to \textit{Gaia} EDR3 data. These targets were observed with the GRACES spectrograph, resulting in precise radial velocities and metallicities that confirm their association with UMi. For the brightest and outermost star (Target~1, at $\sim12$ r$_h$), the chemical abundances of $Œ±$- (Mg, Ca, Ti), odd-Z (Na, K, Sc), Fe-peak (Fe, Ni, Cr), and neutron-capture process (Ba) elements have also been determined.</description>

The role of magnetic fields in galaxy evolution is still an unsolved question in astrophysics. We have previously shown that magnetic fields play a crucial role in major mergers between disc galaxies; in hydrodynamic simulations of such mergers, the Auriga model produces compact remnants with a distinctive bar and ring morphology. In contrast, in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, remnants form radially-extended discs with prominent spiral arm structure. In this paper, we analyse a series of cosmological &amp;amp;#34;zoom-in&amp;amp;#34; simulations of major mergers and identify exactly $\textit{how}$ magnetic fields are able to alter the outcome of the merger.</description>

The presence of an obscuring torus at pc-scale distances from the central black hole is the main ingredient for the Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), as obscured sources are thought to be seen through this structure. However, the Unified Model fails to describe a class of sources that undergo dramatic spectral changes, transitioning from obscured to unobscured and vice-versa through time. The variability in such sources, so-called Changing Look AGN (CLAGN), is thought to be produced by a clumpy medium at much smaller distances than the conventional obscuring torus.</description>

While interstellar gas is known to be supersonically turbulent, the injection processes of this turbulence are still unclear. Many studies suggest a dominant role of gravitational instabilities. However, their effect on galaxy morphology and large-scale dynamics vary across cosmic times, in particular due to the evolution of the gas fraction of galaxies. In this paper, we propose numerical simulations to follow the isothermal turbulent cascade of purely gravitationally-driven turbulence from its injection scale down to 0.</description>

      <description>Howard Baer,
The supersymmetrized DFSZ axion model is especially compelling in that it contains 1. the SUSY solution to the gauge hierarchy problem, 2. the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) solution to the strong CP problem and 3. the Kim-Nilles solution to the SUSY mu problem. In a string setting, where a discrete R-symmetry ({\bf Z}_{24}^R for example) may emerge from the compactification process, a high-quality accidental axion (accion) can emerge from the accidental, approximate remnant global U(1)_{PQ} symmetry where the decay constant f_a is linked to the SUSY breaking scale, and is within the cosmological sweet zone.</description>

We are able to successfully decompose clusters into their collisionless and collisional mass components thanks to the X-ray surface brightness, as well as using the dynamics of cluster members to obtain more accurate masses with the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies.</description>

Bimetric gravity is an interesting alternative to standard GR given its potential to provide a concrete theoretical framework for a ghost-free massive gravity theory. Here we investigate a class of Bimetric gravity models for their cosmological implications. We study the background expansion as well as the growth of matter perturbations at linear and second order. We use low-redshift observations from SnIa (Pantheon+ and SH0ES), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), the growth ($f\sigma_{8}$) measurements and the measurement from Megamaser Cosmology Project to constrain the Bimetric model.</description>

We characterize the peculiar velocity field of the local large-scale structure reconstructed from the $2M++$ survey, by treating it as a fluid, extracting the gradient and the divergence via different approximations. This reconstructed field is important for cosmology, since it was used to correct the peculiar redshifts of the last SNIA compilation Pantheon+. We conclude that the local velocity field can be described on average as a slightly contracting fluid, with intriguing implications for the ``Tilted Cosmology&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; model.</description>

      <description>First author: Kate Napier
Tension between cosmic microwave background-based and distance ladder-based determinations of the Hubble constant H0 motivates pursuit of independent methods that are not subject to the same systematic effects. A promising alternative, proposed by Refsdal in 1964, relies on the inverse scaling of H0 with the delay between the arrival times of at least two images of a strongly-lensed variable source such as a quasar. To date, Refsdal&amp;rsquo;s method has mostly been applied to quasars lensed by individual galaxies rather than by galaxy clusters.</description>

We present new observations of sixteen bright ($r=19-21$) gravitationally lensed galaxies at $z\simeq 1-3$ selected from the CASSOWARY survey. Included in our sample is the $z=1.42$ galaxy CSWA-141, one of the brightest known reionization-era analogs at high redshift (g=20.5), with a large sSFR (31.2 Gyr$^{-1}$) and an $[OIII]$+H$\beta$ equivalent width (EW${\rm{$[OIII]$+H\beta}}$=730~\r{A}) that is nearly identical to the average value expected at $z\simeq 7-8$. In this paper, we investigate the rest-frame UV nebular line emission in our sample with the goal of understanding the factors that regulate strong CIII]$ emission.</description>

X-ray observations of galaxy clusters are impacted by the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a manner that is challenging to quantify, leading to biases in the detection and measurement of cluster properties for both astrophysics and cosmological applications. Using automated X-ray pipeline techniques, we introduce a new automated class for AGN-contaminated (AC) clusters in the XXL source detection software. The majority of these systems are otherwise missed by current X-ray cluster detection methods.</description>

We present new {\em Hubble Space Telescope} WFC3/IR medium-band photometry of the compact elliptical galaxy M32, chemically resolving its thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars. We find 2829 M-type stars and 57 C stars. The carbon stars are likely contaminants from M31. If carbon stars are present in M32 they are so in very low numbers. The uncorrected C/M ratio is 0.020 $\pm$ 0.003; this drops to less than 0.</description>

Supernova (SN) explosions have been sought for decades as a possible source of dust in the Universe, providing the seeds of galaxies, stars, and planetary systems. SN 1987A offers one of the most promising examples of significant SN dust formation, but until the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), instruments have traditionally lacked the sensitivity at both late times (&amp;gt;1 yr post-explosion) and longer wavelengths (i.e., &amp;gt;10 um) to detect analogous dust reservoirs.</description>

We use images collected with the near-infrared camera (NIRCam) on board the James Webb Space Telescope and with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to investigate multiple populations at the bottom of the main sequence (MS) of 47 Tucanae. The F115W vs. F115W-F322W2 CMD from NIRCam shows that, below the knee, the MS stars span a wide color range, where the majority of M-dwarfs exhibit blue colors, and a tail of stars are distributed toward the red.</description>

We study the link between gas flow events and key galaxy scaling relations: the relations between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (the main sequence, MS), gas metallicity and stellar mass (the mass-metallicity relation, MZR) and gas metallicity, stellar mass and SFR (the fundamental metallicity relation, FMR). Using all star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the 22 MUSE fields of the MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) survey, we derive the MS, MZR and FMR scaling relations for 385 SFGs with $M = 10^8 - 10^{11.</description>

Early-time light curves/spectra of some hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) give firm evidence on the existence of confined, dense circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding dying massive stars. We numerically and analytically study radiative acceleration of CSM in such systems, where the radiation is mainly powered by the interaction between the SN ejecta and the CSM. We find that the acceleration of the ambient CSM is larger for massive and compact CSM, with velocities reaching up to $\sim 10^3\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$ for a CSM of order $0.</description>

One of the greatest uncertainties in any modeling of inner engine of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is neutrino flavor conversions driven by neutrino self-interactions. We carry out large-scale numerical simulations of multi-energy, multi-angle, three-flavor framework, and general relativistic quantum kinetic neutrino transport in spherical symmetry with an essential set of neutrino-matter interactions under a realistic fluid profile of CCSN. Our result suggests that the neutrino heating in the gain region is reduced by $\sim 50%$ due to fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC).</description>

For the past decade, SALT2 has been the most common model used to fit Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves for dark energy analyses. Recently, the SALT3 model was released, which upgraded a number of model features but has not yet been used for measurements of dark energy. Here, we evaluate the impact of switching from SALT2 to SALT3 for a SN cosmology analysis. We train SALT2 and SALT3 on an identical training sample of 1083 well-calibrated Type Ia supernovae, ensuring that any differences found come from the underlying model framework.</description>

We present the star formation histories (SFHs) of early-type dwarf galaxies, dSphs and dEs, in the local universe within z=0.01. The SFHs of early-type dwarf galaxies are characterized by pre-enriched, metal-poor old stellar populations, absence of moderately old stars that have ages of a few Gyr. There are some differences in the SFHs of dSphs and dEs. In particular, dSphs formed old ($\gtrsim10$ Gyr old) metal-poor stars $\sim2$ times more than dEs.</description>

The dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies holds a wealth of information on the fundamental properties and interactions of the dark matter particle. In this paper, we study whether ultralight bosonic dark matter is consistent with the gravitational potential extracted from stellar kinematics. We use velocity dispersion measurements to constrain models for halo mass and particle mass. The posterior likelihood is multimodal. Particle masses of order $m\sim 10^{-22} {\rm{eV}}$ require halos of mass in excess of $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$, while particle mass of order $m \gtrsim 10^{-20}{\rm{eV}}$ are favored by halos of mass $\sim [10^{8} - 10^{9}] M_\odot$, with a similar behavior to cold dark matter.</description>

Dirac, in 1937 proposed the variation of coupling constants derived from his large number hypothesis. Efforts have continued since then to constrain their variation by various methods. We briefly discuss several methods used for the purpose while focusing primarily on the use of supernovae type 1a, quasars, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as cosmological probes for determining cosmological distances. Supernovae type Ia (SNeIa) are considered the best standard candles since their intrinsic luminosity can be determined precisely from their light curves.</description>

On large cosmological scales, anisotropic gravitational collapse is manifest in the dark cosmic web. Its statistical properties are well known for the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, yet become modified for alternative dark matter models such as fuzzy dark matter (FDM). In this work, we assess for the first time the relative importance of cosmic nodes, filaments, walls and voids in a cosmology with small-scale suppression of power such as FDM.</description>

      <description>First author: Philip Mocz
We investigate cosmological structure formation in Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) with an attractive self-interaction (SI) with numerical simulations. Such a SI would arise if the FDM boson were an ultra-light axion, which has a strong CP symmetry-breaking scale (decay constant). Although weak, the attractive SI may be strong enough to counteract the quantum &amp;lsquo;pressure&amp;rsquo; and alter structure formation. We find in our simulations that the SI can enhance small-scale structure formation, and soliton cores above a critical mass undergo a phase transition, transforming from dilute to dense solitons.</description>

The metallicity distributions of globular cluster (GC) systems in galaxies are a critical test of any GC formation scenario. In this work, we investigate the predicted GC metallicity distributions of galaxies in the MOdelling Star cluster population Assembly In Cosmological Simulations within EAGLE (E-MOSAICS) simulation of a representative cosmological volume ($L = 34.4$ comoving Mpc). We find that the predicted GC metallicity distributions and median metallicities from the fiducial E-MOSAICS GC formation model agree well the observed distributions, except for galaxies with masses $M_\ast \sim 2 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, which contain an overabundance of metal-rich GCs.</description>

      <description>First author: N. Corso
GeV and TeV emission from the forward shocks of supernova remnants (SNRs) indicates that they are capable particle accelerators, making them promising sources of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs). However, it remains uncertain whether this $\gamma$-ray emission arises primarily from the decay of neutral pions produced by very high energy hadrons, or from inverse-Compton and/or bremsstrahlung emission from relativistic leptons. By applying a semi-analytic approach to non-linear diffusive shock acceleration (NLDSA) and calculating the particle and photon spectra produced in different astrophysical environments, we parametrize the relative strength of hadronic and leptonic emission.</description>

The next Galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) will be a unique opportunity to study within a fully multi-messenger approach the explosion mechanism responsible for the formation of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes. State-of-the-art numerical simulations of those events reveal the complexity of the gravitational-wave emission which is highly stochastic. This challenges the possibility to infer the properties of the compact remnant and of its progenitor using the information encoded in the waveforms.</description>

We report the discovery of an ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy, Pegasus W, located on the far side of the Milky Way-M31 system and outside the virial radius of M31. The distance to the galaxy is 915 (+60/-91) kpc, measured using the luminosity of horizontal branch (HB) stars identified in Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging. The galaxy has a half-light radius (r_h) of 100 (+11/-13) pc, M_V = -7.</description>

We present the star formation histories (SFHs) of early-type dwarf galaxies, dSphs and dEs, in the local universe within z=0.01. The SFHs of early-type dwarf galaxies are characterized by pre-enriched, metal-poor old stellar populations, absence of moderately old stars that have ages of a few Gyr. There are some differences in the SFHs of dSphs and dEs. In particular, dSphs formed old ($\gtrsim10$ Gyr old) metal-poor stars $\sim2$ times more than dEs.</description>

The nature of dark matter (DM) is an open question in cosmology, despite its abundance in the universe. While elementary particles have been posited to explain DM, compact astrophysical objects such as black holes formed in the early universe offer a theoretically appealing alternate route. Here, we constrain the fraction of DM that can be made up of primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M \gtrsim 0.</description>

We have collected 83 new AGN increasing the number of INTEGRAL detected active galaxies (436) by 19%. Half of these new additions are located behind the Galactic plane; for most of them we have full X-ray coverage obtained through archival data from Swift/XRT, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR.</description>

Here we report $60$ bursts detected with the Effelsberg telescope at 1.4 GHz. We observe large variations in the burst rate, and report the first FRB 20200120E `burst storm&amp;amp;#39;, where the source suddenly became active and 53 bursts (fluence $\geq 0.04$ Jy ms) occurred within only 40 minutes.</description>

We present a new method to predict the line-of-sight column density (NH) values of active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on mid-infrared (MIR), soft, and hard X-ray data. We developed a multiple linear regression machine learning algorithm trained with WISE colors, Swift-BAT count rates, soft X-ray hardness ratios, and an MIR-soft X-ray flux ratio. Our algorithm was trained off 451 AGN from the Swift-BAT sample with known NH and has the ability to accurately predict NH values for AGN of all levels of obscuration, as evidenced by its Spearman correlation coefficient value of 0.</description>

The Hubble constant $H_0$ is the value of the cosmic expansion rate at one time (the present), and cannot be adjusted successfully without taking into account the entire expansion history and cosmology. We outline some conditions, that if not quite no go&#39;&#39; are no thanks&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, showing that changing the expansion history, e.g. employing dynamical dark energy, cannot reconcile disparate deductions of $H_0$ without upsetting some other cosmological measurement.</description>

We confirm emission line redshifts for 7 galaxies at $z=7.762-8.998$ using spectra at $\sim1-5\mu$m either with the NIRSpec prism or its three medium resolution gratings. For $z\simeq9$ photometric candidates, we achieve a high confirmation rate of $\simeq$90%, which validates the classical dropout selection from NIRCam photometry.</description>

Upcoming deep galaxy surveys with JWST will probe galaxy evolution during the epoch of reionisation (EoR, $5\leq z\leq10$) over relatively compact areas (e.g. $\sim$ 300,arcmin$^2$ for the JADES GTO survey). It is therefore imperative that we understand the degree of survey variance, to evaluate how representative the galaxy populations in these studies will be. We use the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) to measure the galaxy bias of various tracers over an unprecedentedly large range in overdensity for a hydrodynamic simulation, and use these relations to assess the impact of bias and clustering on survey variance in the EoR.</description>

Contamination from galaxy fragments, identified as sources, is a major issue in large photometric galaxy catalogs. In this paper, we prove that this problem can be easily addressed with computer vision techniques. We use image cutouts to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify catalogued sources that are in reality just star formation regions and/or shreds of larger galaxies. The CNN reaches an accuracy ~98% on our testing datasets.</description>

Large-scale cosmological simulations are an indispensable tool for modern cosmology. To enable model-space exploration, fast and accurate predictions are critical. In this paper, we show that the performance of such simulations can be further improved with time-stepping schemes that use input from cosmological perturbation theory. Specifically, we introduce a class of time-stepping schemes derived by matching the particle trajectories in a single leapfrog/Verlet drift-kick-drift step to those predicted by Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT).</description>

The recent searches for z&amp;gt;11 galaxies using the James Webb Space Telescope have resulted in an unexpectedly high number of candidate objects, which imply at least an order of magnitude higher number density of $z&amp;gt;11$ galaxies than the previously favored predictions. A question has risen whether there are some new types of contaminants among these candidates. The candidate sample of Yan et al. (2023a), totalling 87 dropouts, is the largest one, and we notice that a number of these candidates are point-like.</description>

We find significant systematics in their estimates depending on models and wavelength ranges considered. Using the full-spectrum fitting technique, we find that both $[Z/H]$ and age increase with mass as for local ETGs. Age and metallicity sensitive spectral indices independently confirm these trends.</description>

The derived maps of the stellar line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion are quite regular, show disc-like rotation, and no other structural component of the galaxy.</description>

In this work we test Wasserstein distance in conjunction with persistent homology, as a tool for discriminating large scale structures of simulated universes with different values of $\sigma_8$ cosmological parameter (present root-mean-square matter fluctuation averaged over a sphere of radius 8 Mpc comoving). The Wasserstein distance (a.k.a. the pair-matching distance) was proposed to measure the difference between two networks in terms of persistent homology. The advantage of this approach consists in its non-parametric way of probing the topology of the Cosmic web, in contrast to graph-theoretical approach depending on linking length.</description>

Much excitement surrounds the intense mass loss that seems to take place in some massive stars immediately before core collapse. However, occurring too late, it has a negligible impact on the star&amp;rsquo;s evolution or the final yields, which are influenced instead by the longer-term, quasi-steady mass loss taking place during H and He burning. Late-time observations of core-collapse supernovae interacting with the progenitor wind are one means to constrain this secular mass loss.</description>

      <description>First author: Kei Ito
Protoclusters of galaxies have been found in the last quarter century. However, most of them have been found through the overdensity of star-forming galaxies, and there had been no known structures identified by multiple spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies at $z&amp;gt;2.5$. In this letter, we report the discovery of an overdense structure of massive quiescent galaxies with the spectroscopic redshift $z=2.77$ in the COSMOS field, QO-1000. We first photometrically identify this structure as a $4.</description>

      <description>First author: Johannes U. Lange
We present a novel simulation-based cosmological analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy redshift-space clustering. Compared to analysis methods based on perturbation theory, our simulation-based approach allows us to probe a much wider range of scales, $0.4 , h^{-1} , \mathrm{Mpc}$ to $63 , h^{-1} , \mathrm{Mpc}$, including highly non-linear scales, and marginalises over astrophysical effects such as assembly bias. We apply this framework to data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey LOWZ sample cross-correlated with state-of-the-art gravitational lensing catalogues from the Kilo Degree Survey and the Dark Energy Survey.</description>

We have studied the system of globular clusters (GCs) that formed in other galaxies and eventually accreted onto the Milky Way. Thus, the samples of GCs belonging to different tidal streams, obtained on the basis of the latest data from the Gaia observatory, were taken from the literature. We measured the anisotropy of the distribution of these GCs using the gyration tensor and found that the distribution of GCs in the streams is isotropic.</description>

      <description>Sven Martens
The formation process of multiple populations in globular clusters is still up for debate. Kinematic differences between the populations are particularly interesting in this respect, because they allow us to distinguish between single-epoch formation scenarios and multi-epoch formation scenarios. We analyze the kinematics of 25 globular clusters and aim to find kinematic differences between multiple populations to constrain their formation process. We split red-giant branch (RGB) stars in each cluster into three populations (P1, P2, P3) for the type-II clusters and two populations (P1 and P2) otherwise using Hubble photometry.</description>

By using direct N-body numerical simulations, we model the dynamical co-evolution of two supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the surrounding stars in merging galaxies. In order to investigate how different stellar components evolve during the merger, we generate evolved stellar distributions with an initial mass function. Special schemes have also been developed to deal with some rare but interesting events, such as tidal disruption of main sequence stars, the plunge of low mass stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars and stellar mass black holes, and the partial tidal disruption of red giants or asymptotic giant branch stars.</description>

We use the measured scattering timescales of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) from the CHIME catalog to derive an upper limit on the magnetic field on sub-kpc scales in the intergalactic medium (IGM). A nonmagnetized, photoionized IGM is insufficient to explain the turbulent scattering at all redshifts, with a Warm-Hot component being marginally consistent with the data at $z \sim 1$. Accounting for the lower envelope of the temporal smearing distribution with a nonzero magnetic field leads to upper limits $B &amp;lt; 10$ nG on scales of 0.</description>

Based on a comparison of the SRG/eROSITA catalog of X-ray active stars and the Gaia catalog, a sample of 502 peculiar objects was obtained for which Gaia, on one hand, detects statistically significant values of parallax or proper motion and, on the other hand, registers signs of the non zero source extent in the optical band. In the log ($F_X/F_{\rm opt}$) - (G-RP) color diagram these objects are separated from the balk of X-ray active stars and are located in the region typical for the galaxies with active nuclei.</description>

The existence of globular clusters (GCs) in a few satellite galaxies, and their absence in majority of dwarf galaxies, present a challenge for models attempting to understand the origins of GCs. In addition to GC presence appearing stochastic and difficult to describe with average trends, in the smallest satellite galaxies GCs contribute a substantial fraction of total stellar mass. We investigate the stochasticity and number of GCs in dwarf galaxies using an updated version of our model that links the formation of GCs to the growth of the host galaxy mass.</description>

      <description>Andrea Incatasciato
The Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation field is a key ingredient in the chemo-thermal evolution of gas in the Early Universe, as it dissociates H2 molecules, the primary cooling channel in an environment devoid of metals and dust. Despite its important role, it is still not implemented in cosmological simulations on a regular basis, in contrast to the general UV background. This is in part due to uncertainty in the source modelling, their spectra and abundance, as well as the detailed physics involved in the propagation of the photons and their interactions with the molecules.</description>

The problem of the spatial motion of a passively gravitating body (PGB) in the gravitational field of a layered inhomogeneous elliptical galaxy (LIEG) is considered on the basis of the previously developed model. It is assumed that a LIEG consists of baryonic mass (BM) and dark matter (DM), which have different laws of density distribution. A star or the center of mass of a globular cluster is taken as the PGB, the motion of which considers the BM and DM attraction.</description>

For SN 2017gci, for which we present two epochs of spectropolarimetry at +3 d and +29 d post-peak in rest frame, accompanied by four epochs of imaging polarimetry up to +108 d. The spectropolarimetry at +3 d shows increasing polarisation degree P towards the redder wavelengths and exhibits signs of axial symmetry, but at +29 d P=0 throughout the spectrum implying that the photosphere of SN 2017gci evolved from a slightly aspherical configuration to a more spherical one in the first month post-peak.</description>

Detector configurations with sizes ranging from 16 m to 22 m tank diameter and 10% to 20% PMT coverage are used to compare the expected observable antineutrino spectra based on the Nakazato, Vartanyan and Warren supernova models.</description>

We search for ultra-light axions as dark matter (DM) and dark energy particle candidates, for axion masses $10^{-32},\mathrm{eV} \leq m_\mathrm{a} \leq 10^{-24},\mathrm{eV}$, by a joint analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy clustering data &amp;ndash; and consider if axions can resolve the tension in inferred values of the matter clustering parameter $S_8$. We give legacy constraints from Planck 2018 CMB data, improving 2015 limits on the axion density $\Omega_\mathrm{a} h^2$ by up to a factor of three; CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope marginally weaken Planck bounds at $m_\mathrm{a} = 10^{-25},\mathrm{eV}$, owing to lower (and theoretically-consistent) gravitational lensing signals.</description>

Star-forming, H$\alpha$-emitting clumps are found embedded in the gaseous tails of galaxies undergoing intense ram-pressure stripping in galaxy clusters, so-called jellyfish galaxies. These clumps offer a unique opportunity to study star formation under extreme conditions, in the absence of an underlying disk and embedded within the hot intracluster medium. Yet, a comprehensive, high spatial resolution study of these systems is missing. We obtained UVIS/HST data to observe the first statistical sample of clumps in the tails and disks of six jellyfish galaxies from the GASP survey; we used a combination of broad-band filters and a narrow-band H{\alpha} filter.</description>

The powerful high-redshift quasar J2102+6015 (at z=4.575) may provide useful information for studying supermassive black hole growth, galaxy evolution and feedback in the early Universe. The source has so far been imaged with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) at 2/8 GHz (S/X) bands only, showing complex compact structure. Its total radio spectrum peaks at ~6 GHz in the rest frame. There is no sign of Doppler-boosted jet emission, and the separation of the two major features in its east-west oriented structure spanning ~10 milliarcsec does not change significantly on a timescale longer than a decade.</description>

A model-independent or non-parametric approach for modeling a database has been widely used in cosmology. In these scenarios, the data has been used directly to reconstruct an underlying function. In this work, we introduce a novel semi-model-independent method to do the task. The new approach not only removes some drawbacks of previous methods but also has some remarkable advantages. We combine the well-known Gaussian linear model with a neural network and introduce a procedure for the reconstruction of an arbitrary function.</description>

The information on Galactic assembly time is imprinted on the chemodynamics of globular clusters. This makes them important probes that help us to understand the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Discerning between in-situ and ex-situ origin of these objects is difficult when we study the Galactic bulge, which is the most complex and mixed component of the Milky Way. To investigate the early evolution of the Galactic bulge, we analysed the globular cluster NGC 6355.</description>

      <description>First author: T. Tuominen
The current observational status of the hot (log T(K) &amp;gt; 5.5) warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) remains incomplete. While recent observations from stacking large numbers of Cosmic Web filaments have yielded statistically significant detections, direct measurements of single objects remain scarce. The lack of such a sample currently prevents a robust analysis of the cosmic baryon content composed of the hot WHIM, which could help solve the cosmological missing baryons problem.</description>

      <description>First author: M. Arabsalmani
We study the relation between the metallicities of ionised and neutral gas in star-forming galaxies at z=1-3 using the EAGLE cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. This is done by constructing a dense grid of sightlines through the simulated galaxies and obtaining the star formation rate- and HI column density-weighted metallicities, Z_{SFR} and Z_{HI}, for each sightline as proxies for the metallicities of ionised and neutral gas, respectively. We find Z_{SFR} &amp;gt; Z_{HI} for almost all sightlines, with their difference generally increasing with decreasing metallicity.</description>

      <description>First author: Alejandro Aviles
The next generation of galaxy surveys will provide highly accurate measurements of the large-scale structure of the Universe, allowing for more stringent tests of gravity on cosmological scales. Higher order statistics are a valuable tool to study the non-Gaussianities in the matter field and to break degeneracies between modified gravity and other physical or nuisance parameters. However, understanding from first principles the behaviour of these correlations is essential to characterise deviations from General Relativity (GR), and the purpose of this work.</description>

We used fluxes of the optical narrow emission line intensities $3,500&amp;lt;\lambda($\AA$)&amp;lt;7,000$ of 561 Seyfert nuclei in the local universe ($z\lesssim0.31$) from the second catalog and data release (DR2) of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey, which focuses on the \textit{Swift}-BAT hard X-ray ($\gtrsim10$ keV) detected AGNs.</description>

      <description>First author: Seiji Kameno
The radio galaxy NGC 1052 casts absorption features of sulfur-bearing molecules, H$_2$S, SO, SO$_2$, and CS toward the radio continuum emission from the core and jets. Using ALMA, we have measured the equivalent widths of SO absorption features in multiple transitions and determined the temperatures of $344 \pm 43$ K and $26 \pm 4$ K in sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths, respectively. Since sub-mm and mm continuum represents the core and jets, the high and low temperatures of the absorbers imply warm environment in the molecular torus and cooler downstream flows.</description>

Long-term observations of synchrotron emission from supernovae (SNe), covering more than a year after the explosion, provide a unique opportunity to study the poorly-understood evolution of massive stars in the final millennium of their lives via changes in the mass-loss rate. Here, we present a result of our long-term monitoring of a peculiar type IIL SN 2018ivc, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Following the initial decay, it showed unprecedented rebrightening starting at ~ a year after the explosion.</description>

Strong gravitational lensing and microlensing of supernovae (SNe) are emerging as a new probe of cosmology and astrophysics in recent years. We provide an overview of this nascent research field, starting with a summary of the first discoveries of strongly lensed SNe. We describe the use of the time delays between multiple SN images as a way to measure cosmological distances and thus constrain cosmological parameters, particularly the Hubble constant, whose value is currently under heated debates.</description>

We observe at least once 88 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), 12 tidal disruption events (TDEs) and 203 other transients, including supernovae (SNe). We stack our ACT observations to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the maps.</description>

Milky Way-mass galaxies in the FIRE-2 simulations demonstrate two main modes of star formation. At high redshifts star formation occurs in a series of short and intense bursts, while at low redshifts star formation proceeds at a steady rate with a transition from one mode to another at times ranging from 3 to 7 Gyr ago for different galaxies. We analyse how the mode of star formation affects iron and alpha-element abundance.</description>

      <description>John Pharo,
We present measurements of $[NeIII]$ Œª3869 emission in z~1 low-mass galaxies taken from the Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic surveys HALO7D and DEEPWinds. We identify 167 individual galaxies with significant $[NeIII]$ emission lines, including 112 &amp;amp;#34;dwarf&amp;amp;#34; galaxies with log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &amp;amp;lt; 9.5, with 0.3 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 1.4. We also measure $[NeIII]$ emission from composite spectra derived from all $[OII]$ŒªŒª3727,3729 line emitters in this range. This provides a unique sample of $[NeIII]$-emitters in the gap between well-studied emitters at z = 0 and 2 &amp;amp;lt; z &amp;amp;lt; 3.</description>

Our sample includes quasars and narrow-line Seyfert 1s: thus our AGN span a wide range in luminosity, black hole mass and accretion rate.</description>

Spectroscopic studies of extreme-ionization galaxies (EIGs) are critical to our understanding of exotic systems throughout cosmic time. These EIGs exhibit spectral features requiring &amp;gt;54.42 eV photons: the energy needed to fully ionize helium into He2+ and emit He II recombination lines. They are likely key contributors to reionization, and they can also probe exotic stellar populations or accretion onto massive black holes. To facilitate the use of EIGs as probes of high ionization, we focus on ratios constructed from strong rest-frame UV/optical emission lines, specifically $[O III]$ 5008, H-beta, $[Ne III]$ 3870, $[O II]$ 3727,3729, and $[Ne V]$ 3427.</description>

Supernova remnants are commonly considered to produce most of the Galactic cosmic rays via diffusive shock acceleration. However, many questions about the physical conditions at shock fronts, such as the magnetic-field morphology close to the particle acceleration sites, remain open. Here we report the detection of a localized polarization signal from some synchrotron X-ray emitting regions of Tycho&amp;rsquo;s supernova remnant made by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer.</description>

We present a new methodology for simulating mid-infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in galaxy evolution simulations. To do this, we combine theoretical models of PAH emission features as they respond to varying interstellar radiation fields, grain size distributions, and ionization states with a new on-the-fly model for dust evolution in hydrodynamic galaxy simulations. We apply these models to 3 idealized arepo galaxy evolution simulations within the smuggle physics framework.</description>

These equations are able to account for the tilt of the Fundamental Plane (FP) and to explain the observed distributions of ETGs in all its projections.</description>

External accretion events such as a galaxy merger or the accretion of gas from the immediate environment of a galaxy, can create a large misalignment between the gas and the stellar kinematics. Numerical simulations have suggested that misaligned structures may promote the inflow of gas to the nucleus of the galaxy and the accretion of gas by the central supermassive black hole. We show for the first time that galaxies with a strong misalignment between the ionised gas and stellar kinematic angles have a higher observed fraction of active black holes than galaxies with aligned rotation of gas and stars.</description>

Arkenstone is a new model for multiphase, stellar feedback driven galactic winds designed for inclusion in coarse resolution cosmological simulations. In this first paper of a series, we describe the features that allow Arkenstone to properly treat high specific energy wind components and demonstrate them using idealised non-cosmological simulations of a galaxy with a realistic CGM, using the Arepo code. Hot, fast gas phases with low mass loadings are predicted to dominate the energy content of multiphase outflows.</description>

The ultra-luminous infrared galaxy Arp2 20 is a late-stage merger with several tidal structures in the outskirts and two very compact, dusty nuclei that show evidence for extreme star formation and host at least one AGN. New and archival high-resolution images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope provide a state-of-the-art view of the structures, dust, and stellar clusters in Arp 220. We find that ~90% of the Halpha emission arises from a shock-ionized bubble emanating from the AGN in the western nucleus, while the nuclear disks dominate the Pbeta emission.</description>

At least one dimensionless physical constant (i.e., a physically observable) must change for the cosmic time to make the varying speed of light (VSL) models phenomenologically feasible. Various physical constants and quantities also should be functions of cosmic time to satisfy all known local laws of physics, including special relativity, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. Adiabaticity is another necessary condition to keep the homogeneity and isotropy of three-dimensional space [1].</description>

We find that every star is deficient in metals (-3.6 &amp;amp;lt; $[Fe/H]$ &amp;amp;lt; -1.9) and in neutron-capture elements as is characteristic of UFD stars, unambiguously confirming their association with Tucana II. Other chemical abundances (e.g., C, iron-peak) largely follow UFD trends and suggest that faint core-collapse supernovae (SNe) dominated the early evolution of Tucana II.</description>

We present a dynamical analysis of a quasar-host galaxy at $z\simeq 6$ (SDSS J2310+1855) using a high-resolution ALMA observation of the $[CII]$ emission line. The observed rotation curve was fitted with mass models that considered the gravitational contribution of a thick gas disc, a thick star-forming stellar disc, and a central mass concentration, which is likely due to a combination of a spheroidal component (i.e. a stellar bulge) and a supermassive black hole (SMBH).</description>

      <description>First author: Tucker Jones
The abundance of carbon relative to oxygen (C/O) is a promising probe of star formation history in the early universe, as these elements are produced on different timescales. We present a measurement of $\log{\mathrm{(C/O)}} = -1.01\pm0.12$ (stat) $\pm0.10$ (sys) in a $z=6.23$ galaxy observed as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program. Notably, we achieve good precision thanks to the detection of the rest-frame ultraviolet O III], C III], and C IV emission lines delivered by JWST/NIRSpec.</description>

We utilize medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations of 164 galaxies at $z=2.0-9.3$ from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey to investigate the evolution of the excitation and ionization properties of galaxies at high redshifts. Our results represent the first statistical constraints on the evolution of the $[OIII]$/H$\beta$ vs. $[NII]$/H$\alpha$, $[SII]$/H$\alpha$, and $[OI]$/H$\alpha$ ``BPT&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; diagrams at $z&amp;gt;2.7$, and the first analysis of the O32 vs. R23 diagram at $z&amp;gt;4$ with a large sample.</description>

      <description>Mohsen Khodadi
This paper is dedicated to assessing modified cosmological settings based on the gravitational Standard-Model Extension (SME). Our analysis rests upon the Hubble tension (HT), which is a discrepancy between the observational determination of the Hubble parameter via data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae, respectively. While the latter approach is model-independent, the former highly depends on the model used to describe the physics of the early Universe.</description>

We analyze all available X-ray data from \chandra, \xmm, and \nustar, adding up to a total of 53 individual observations. This corresponds to between 3 and 7 observations per source, probing variability timescales between a few days and $\sim 20$~yr.</description>

Gravitational waves (GWs) from the compact binary coalescences can be used as standard sirens to explore the cosmic expansion history. In the next decades, it is anticipated that we could obtain the multi-band GW standard siren data (from nanohertz to a few hundred hertz), which are expected to play an important role in cosmological parameter estimation. In this work, we give for the first time the joint constraints on cosmological parameters using the future multi-band GW standard siren observations.</description>

      <description>First author: Mengtao Tang
We describe new JWST/NIRSpec observations of galaxies at $z\gtrsim7$ taken as part of the CEERS survey of the EGS field. Previous observations of this area have revealed associations of Ly$\alpha$ emitters at redshifts ($z=7.5$, $7.7$, $8.7$) where the IGM is thought mostly neutral, leading to suggestions that these systems are situated in large ionized bubbles. We identify 21 $z\gtrsim7$ galaxies with robust redshifts in the CEERS dataset, including 10 in the Ly$\alpha$ associations.</description>

Using the data from Gaia (ESA) Data Release 2 we performed the orbital calculations of globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way. To explore possible close encounters (or collisions) between the GCs, using our own developed high-order phi-GRAPE code, we integrated backward and forward the orbits of 119 objects with reliable positions and proper motions. In calculations, we adopted a realistic axisymmetric Galactic potential (bulge + disk + halo).</description>

Different from previously reported results, which show a seemingly extended source, we instead find two individual point sources, one consistent with being at the center and one 0\fdg4 south-east of the center.</description>

One of the primary goals when studying galaxy formation is to understand how the luminous component of the Universe, galaxies, relates to the growth of structure which is dominated by the gravitational collapse of dark matter haloes. The stellar-to-halo mass relation probes how galaxies occupy dark matter haloes and what that entails for their star formation history. We deliver the first self-consistent empirical model that can place constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation down to log stellar mass $\log_{10}(m^/\mathrm{M}{\odot}) \leq 5.</description>

The standard model of cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) is facing a serious crisis caused by the inconsistencies in the measurements of some fundamental cosmological parameters (Hubble constant $H_{0}$ and cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_{k}$ for example). On the other hand a strictly linear evolution of the cosmological scale factor is found to be an excellent fit to a host of observations. Any model that can support such a coasting presents itself as a falsifiable model as far as the cosmological tests are concerned.</description>

      <description>First author: Benjamin Metha
Massive stars are thought to be progenitors of Long Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), most likely with a bias favouring low metallicity progenitors. Because galaxies do not have a constant metallicity throughout, the combination of line-of-sight absorption metallicity inferred from GRB afterglow spectroscopy and of host galaxy global metallicity derived from emission lines diagnostics represents a powerful way to probe both the bias function for GRB progenitors, and the chemical inhomogeneities across star forming regions.</description>

Photometric quality metrics from DOLPHOT in one or two filters can recover a pure sample of stars. Conversely, colors formed between short-wavelength (SW) and long-wavelength (LW) filters can be used to effectively identify pure samples of galaxies.</description>

Extreme stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe), including Type Ic superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), broad-line Type Ic SNe (SNe Ic-BL), and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), are widely believed to harbor a newborn fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron star (``magnetar&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;), which can lose its rotational energy via spin-down processes to accelerate and heat the ejecta. The progenitor(s) of these magnetar-driven SESNe, and the origin of considerable angular momentum (AM) in the cores of massive stars to finally produce such fast-spinning magnetars upon core-collapse are still under debate.</description>

Stellar bars have been found to substantially influence the stellar populations properties in galaxies, affecting their ability of forming stars. While this can be easily seen when studying galaxies in relatively isolated environments, such kind of analysis takes a higher degree of complexity when cluster galaxies are considered, due to the variety of interactions which can potentially occur in these denser environments. We use IFU MUSE data from the GASP survey to study the combined effect of the presence of a stellar bar and of ram pressure, on spatially resolved properties of stellar populations.</description>

      <description>First author: Pia Jakobus
Using relativistic supernova simulations of massive progenitor stars with a quark-hadron equation of state (EoS) and a purely hadronic EoS, we identify a distinctive feature in the gravitational-wave signal that originates from a buoyancy-driven mode (g-mode) below the proto-neutron star convection zone. The mode frequency lies in the range $200\lesssim f\lesssim 800,\text{Hz}$ and decreases with time. As the mode lives in the core of the proto-neutron star, its frequency and power are highly sensitive to the EoS, in particular the sound speed around twice saturation density.</description>

The relationship between galaxies and haloes is central to the description of galaxy formation, and a fundamental step towards extracting precise cosmological information from galaxy maps. However, this connection involves several complex processes that are interconnected. Machine Learning methods are flexible tools that can learn complex correlations between a large number of features, but are traditionally designed as deterministic estimators. In this work, we use the IllustrisTNG300-1 simulation and apply neural networks in a binning classification scheme to predict probability distributions of central galaxy properties, namely stellar mass, colour, specific star formation rate, and radius, using as input features the halo mass, concentration, spin, age, and the overdensity on a scale of 3 $h^{-1}$ Mpc.</description>

Mrk 1239 is a highly polarized NLS1 in the optical band, whose $0.3-3$ keV spectrum has remained remarkably consistent over more than two decades of observation. Previous analysis of this object suggested that the soft X-ray band was dominated by emission lines (collisionally and/or photoionized) from the distant host galaxy as the X-ray emission from the central engine was highly obscured. New XMM-Newton data of Mrk 1239 are presented here to investigate the soft X-ray band of this galaxy with high resolution.</description>

NGC 4839 is the brightest galaxy (cD) of the NGC 4839 group at $R\approx 1$ Mpc in the south-west of the Coma cluster, which is known to be falling into Coma. However, it has been controversial whether it is in the first phase of infall or in the second phase of infall after passing the Coma center. We present a wide field study of globular clusters (GCs) in NGC 4839 and its environment based on Hyper Suprime-Cam $gr$ images in the Subaru archive.</description>

Multiple populations (MPs), characterized by variations in light elemental abundances, have been found in stellar clusters in the Milky Way, Magellanic Clouds, as well as several other dwarf galaxies. Based on a large amount of observations, mass has been suggested to be a key parameter affecting the presence and appearance of MPs in stellar clusters. To further investigate the existence of MPs in low-mass clusters and explore the mass threshold for MP formation, we carried out a project studying the stellar population composition in several low-mass Galactic globular clusters.</description>

We presented the multiwavelength analysis of a heavily obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) in NGC 449. We first constructed a broadband X-ray spectrum using the latest NuSTAR and XMM-Newton data. Its column density ($\simeq 10^{24} \rm{cm}^{-2}$) and photon index ($\Gamma\simeq 2.4$) were reliably obtained by analyzing the broadband X-ray spectrum. However, the scattering fraction and the intrinsic X-ray luminosity could not be well constrained. Combined with the information obtained from the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrum and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we derived its intrinsic X-ray luminosity ($\simeq 8.</description>

      <description>First author: Roshna K
Primordial non-Gaussianity has set strong constraints on models of the early universe. Studies have shown that Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC), which is an attempt to extend inflationary scenario to planck scales, leads to a strongly scale dependent and oscillatory non-Gaussianity. In particular, the non-Gaussianity function $f_{_{\rm NL}}(k_1,, k_2,, k_3)$ generated in LQC, though similar to that generated during slow roll inflation at small scales, is highly scale dependent and oscillatory at large wavelengths.</description>

We apply a population-orbit superposition method to 16 galaxies in the Fornax cluster observed with MUSE/VLT in the context of the Fornax3D project. By fitting the luminosity distribution, stellar kinematics, and age and metallicity maps simultaneously, we obtained the internal stellar orbit distribution, as well as the age and metallicity distribution of stars on different orbits for each galaxy. Based on the model, we decompose each galaxy into a dynamically cold disk (orbital circularity $\lambda_z\ge0.</description>

The ROSAT-selected tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate RX J133157.6-324319.7 (J1331), was detected in 1993 as a bright (0.2-2 keV flux of $(1.0 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$), ultra-soft ($kT=0.11 \pm 0.03$ keV) X-ray flare from a quiescent galaxy ($z=0.05189$).

We present a study of the distribution of galaxies along the radius of 157 groups and clusters of galaxies (200~km~s$^{-1}$ &amp;lt; $\sigma$ &amp;lt; 1100~km~s$^{-1}$) of the local Universe (0.01 &amp;lt; $z$ &amp;lt; 0.1). We introduced a new boundary of galaxy systems and identified it with the splashback radius $R_{sp}$. We also identified the central region of galaxy systems with a radius of $R_c$. These radii are defined by the observed integrated distribution of the total number of galaxies depending on the squared distance from the center of the groups/clusters coinciding, as a rule, with the brightest galaxy.</description>

      <description>Isabel M. E. Santos-Santos,
We use the APOSTLE Local Group (LG) cosmological hydro-simulations to examine the properties of &amp;amp;#34;backsplash&amp;amp;#34; galaxies, i.e, dwarfs which were within the virial boundaries of the Milky Way (MW) or M31 in the past, but are today outside their virial radius ($r_{200}$). More than half of all dwarfs between $1-2\,r_{200}$ of each primary are backsplash. More distant backsplash systems, i.e., those reaching distances well beyond $2\,r_{200}$, are typically close to apocentre of nearly radial orbits, and, therefore, essentially at rest relative to their primary.</description>

      <description>First author: Lei Yang
We present a smoothed density-corrected $V_{\rm max}$ technique for building a random catalog for property-dependent galaxy clustering estimation. This approach is essentially based on the density-corrected $V_{\rm max}$ method of Cole(2011), with three improvements to the original method. To validate the improved method, we generate two sets of flux-limited samples from two independent mock catalogs with different $k+e$ corrections. By comparing the two-point correlation functions, our results demonstrate that the random catalog created by the smoothed density-corrected $V_{\rm max}$ approach provides a more accurate and precise measurement for both sets of mock samples than the commonly used $V_{\rm max}$ method and redshift shuffled method.</description>

There exists a well known relation between the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the center of galaxies and their bulge mass or central velocity dispersion. This suggests a co-evolution between SMBH and their galaxy hosts. Our aim is to study this relation specifically for radio loud galaxies, and as a function of redshift $z$. We selected a sample of radio-galaxies and AGN by cross-matching the low radio frequency sources from VLA FIRST with spectroscopically confirmed sources from wide field surveys including SDSS DR14 ugriz and DES DR2 grzY in optical, WISE in infrared, and the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic survey.</description>

The spectral line energy distribution of carbon monoxide contains information about the physical conditions of the star forming molecular hydrogen gas; however, the relation to local radiation field properties is poorly constrained. Using ~ 1-2 kpc scale ALMA observations of CO(3-2) and CO(4-3), we characterize the CO(4-3)/CO(3-2) line ratios of local analogues of main sequence galaxies at z ~ 1-2, drawn from the DYNAMO sample. We measure CO(4-3)/CO(3-2) across the disk of each galaxy and find a median line ratio of $R_{43} = 0.</description>

Nearby dwarf irregular galaxies are ideal laboratories for studying the interstellar medium (ISM) at low metallicity, which is expected to be common for galaxies at very high redshift that will be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. We present the first high-resolution (~0.2 pc) hydrodynamical simulations of an isolated low-metallicity ($0.1~Z_\odot$) dwarf galaxy coupled with a time-dependent chemistry network and a dust evolution model where dust is locally produced and destroyed by various processes.</description>

In the FLARES (First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations) suite of hydrodynamical simulations, we find the high redshift ($z&amp;gt;5$) intrinsic size-luminosity relation is, surprisingly, negatively sloped. However, after including the effects of dust attenuation we find a positively sloped UV observed size-luminosity relation in good agreement with other simulated and observational studies. In this work, we extend this analysis to probe the underlying physical mechanisms driving the formation and evolution of the compact galaxies driving the negative size-mass/size-luminosity relation.</description>

Context. Our Galaxy is composed of different stellar populations with varying chemical abundances, which are thought to imprint the composition of planet building blocks (PBBs). As such, the properties of stars should affect the properties of planets and small bodies formed in their systems. In this context, high-resolution spectroscopic surveys open a window into the chemical links between and their host stars. Aims. We aim to determine the PBB composition trends for various stellar populations across the Galaxy by comparing the two large spectroscopic surveys APOGEE and GALAH.</description>

      <description>Chia-Hsuan Cheng,
To investigate the dynamical properties of globular clusters, the surface brightness and kinematic data were collected and fitted to a family of lowered isothermal models called LIMEPY models. For 18 studied globular clusters, the amounts of concentration, truncation, and anisotropy were determined. In addition, the cluster mass, half-mass radius, distance, and mass-to-light ratio were also obtained. In general, LIMEPY models could describe these clusters well. Among these 18 clusters, NGC 5139, NGC 6388, and NGC 7078 were claimed to be candidates to host intermediate-mass black holes in literature.</description>

Many studies concluded that magnetic fields suppress star formation in molecular clouds and Milky Way like galaxies. However, most of these studies are based on fully developed fields that have reached the saturation level, with little work on investigating how an initial weak primordial field affects star formation in low metallicity environments. In this paper, we investigate the impact of a weak initial field on low metallicity dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <description>First author: Andrea Antoni
When collapse of the iron core in a massive red or yellow supergiant does not lead to a neutrino-driven explosion, a significant fraction of the convective hydrogen envelope will fall in towards the black hole formed from the collapsing core. The random velocity field in the convective envelope results in finite specific angular momentum in each infalling shell. Using 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we follow the infall of this material to small radii, resolving the circularization radii of the flow.</description>

To integrate the orbits backward in time, the authors use models of the time-varying potentials derived from cosmological simulations, which are closest to the potential of the Galaxy. This allows for estimating the probability of close passages (collisions) of GCs with respect to each other and the Galactic center (GalC) in the Galaxy undergoing dynamic changes in the past.</description>

These galaxies have a median stellar mass of $\log(M_\ast/\rm{M_\odot})_{\rm{med}} = 8.29^{+0.51}_{-0.43}$ and a median star formation rate of $\rm{SFR_{HŒ±}^{med} = 2.25^{+2.15}_{-1.26}\ M_\odot\ yr^{-1}}$.

We present the e-TidalGCs Project which aims at modeling and predicting the extra-tidal features surrounding all Galactic globular clusters for which 6D phase space information, masses and sizes are available (currently 159 globular clusters). We focus the analysis and presentation of the results on the distribution of extra-tidal material on the sky, and on the different structures found at different heliocentric distances. We emphasize the wide variety of morphologies found: beyond the canonical tidal tails, our models reveal that the extra-tidal features generated by globular clusters take a wide variety of shapes, from thin and elongated shapes, to thick, and complex halo-like structures.</description>

Such limitation arises from the lack of a comprehensive observational investigation of this topic.

We calculate the binding energy at core collapse under the assumption that the remnant is a NS. Namely, stellar gas above mass coordinate of $~1.</description>

      <description>First author: Eleanor R. Downing
It is routinely assumed that galaxy rotation curves are equal to their circular velocity curves (modulo some corrections) such that they are good dynamical mass tracers. We take a visualisation-driven approach to exploring the limits of the validity of this assumption for a sample of $33$ low-mass galaxies ($60&amp;lt;v_\mathrm{max}/\mathrm{km},\mathrm{s}^{-1}&amp;lt;120$) from the APOSTLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Only $3$ of these have rotation curves nearly equal to their circular velocity curves at $z=0$, the rest are undergoing a wide variety of dynamical perturbations.</description>

In 1181 AD, Chinese and Japanese observers reported a bright Guest Star&#39; in the constellation Chuanshe, unmoving and visible for 185 days. In 2013, D. Patchick discovered a unique nebula surrounding a unique star, with two groups attributing this structure, named Pa 30&amp;rsquo;, to be the supernova remnant of SN 1181, as a sub-subclass of supernova, the low-luminosity Type Iax. Here, I provide a wide range of new observational evidence: First, a detailed analysis of the original Chinese and Japanese reports places the `Guest Star&amp;rsquo; of 1181 into a small region with the only interesting source being Pa 30.</description>

      <description>First author: Melinda Townsend
Luminous Red Galaxies, or LRGs, are representative of the most massive galaxies and were originally selected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as good tracers of large scale structure. They are dominated by by uniformly old stellar populations, have low star formation rates, early type morphologies, and little cold gas. Despite having old stellar populations and little in situ star formation, studies have shown that they have grown their stellar mass since z=1, implying that they grow predominantly via the accretion of satellites.</description>

(abridged) Stable circumbinary discs around evolved post-Asymptotic Giant branch (post-AGB) binary systems show many similarities with protoplanetary discs around young stellar objects. These discs can provide constraints on both binary evolution and the formation of macrostructures within circumstellar discs. Here we focus on one post-AGB binary system: IRAS08544-4431. We aim to refine the physical model of IRAS08544-4431 with a radiative transfer treatment and continue the near-infrared and mid-infrared interferometric analysis covering the H-, K-, L-, and N-bands.</description>

Among the supernovae (SNe) that show strong interaction with the circumstellar medium, there is a rare subclass of Type Ia supernovae, SNe Ia-CSM, that show strong narrow hydrogen emission lines much like SNe IIn but on top of a diluted over-luminous Type Ia spectrum. In the only previous systematic study of this class (Silverman et al. 2013), 16 objects were identified, 8 historic and 8 from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF).</description>

We fit a new vertically extended corona model to previously measured reverberation time lags observed by \emph{XMM-Newton} in two extremely variable Narrow Line Seyfert 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), 1H~0707-495 and IRAS~13224-3809, in a variety of similarly observed flux groups and explore the model in all observations over a 16 year period. The model employs two X-ray sources located along the black hole rotational axis at height, $h_1$ and $h_2$ respectively.</description>

      <description>First author: Benjamin Wehmeyer
While modelling the galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of stable elements provides insights to the formation history of the Galaxy and the relative contributions of nucleosynthesis sites, modelling the evolution of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs) can provide supplementary timing information on recent nucleosynthesis. To study the evolution of SLRs, we need to understand their spatial distribution. Using a 3-dimensional GCE model, we investigated the evolution of four SLRs: Mn-53, Fe-60, Hf-182, and Pu-244 with the aim of explaining detections of recent (within the last $\approx$1-20 Myr) deposition of live Mn-53, Fe-60, and Pu-244 of extrasolar origin into deep-sea reservoirs.</description>

Jet precession is sometimes invoked to explain asymmetries in radio galaxy (RG) jets and &amp;ldquo;X/S/Z-shape&amp;rdquo; radio galaxies, caused by the presence of a binary black hole companion to the source active galactic nucleus (AGN) or by accretion instabilities. We present a series of simulations of radio galaxy jet precession to examine how these sources would evolve over time, including a passive distribution of cosmic ray electrons (CRe) so we can model radio synchrotron emissions and create synthetic radio maps of the sources.</description>

      <description>First author: C. Pellegrino
We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2020bio, a double-peaked Type IIb supernova (SN) discovered within a day of explosion, primarily obtained by Las Cumbres Observatory and Swift. SN 2020bio displays a rapid and long-lasting initial decline throughout the first week of its light curve, similar to other well-studied Type IIb SNe. This early-time emission is thought to originate from the cooling of the extended outer envelope of the progenitor star that is shock-heated by the SN explosion.</description>

We investigate the stellar mass-dependence of the galaxy size-dark matter halo radius relation for low redshift galaxies using weak gravitational lensing measurements. Our sample consists of $\sim$38,000 galaxies more massive than $10^{8} {\rm M}{\odot}h^{-2}$ and within $z&amp;lt;0.3$ drawn from the overlap of GAMA survey DR4 and HSC-SSP PDR2. We divide our sample into a number of stellar mass bins and measure stacked weak lensing signals.</description>

      <description>First author: Sudipta Sikder
The reported detection of the global 21-cm signal by the EDGES collaboration is significantly stronger than standard astrophysical predictions. One possible explanation is an early radio excess above the cosmic microwave background. Such a radio background could have been produced by high redshift galaxies, if they were especially efficient in producing low-frequency synchrotron radiation. We have previously studied the effects of such an inhomogeneous radio background on the 21-cm signal; however, we made a simplifying assumption of isotropy of the background seen by each hydrogen cloud.</description>

Massive elliptical galaxies align pointing towards each other in the structure of the Universe. Such alignments are well-described at large scales through a linear relation with respect to the tidal field of the large-scale structure. At such scales, galaxy alignments are sensitive to the presence of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). The shape of the BAO feature in galaxy alignment correlations differs from the traditional peak in the clustering correlation function.</description>

Optical spectropolarimetry of the normal thermonuclear supernova SN2019np from -14.5 to +14.5 days relative to B-band maximum detected an intrinsic continuum polarization, p(cont), of 0.21+-0.09% at the first epoch. Between days -11.5 to +05, p(cont) remained about 0 and by day +14.5 was again significant at 0.19+-0.10%. Not considering the first epoch, the dominant axis of SiII(6355A) was roughly constant, staying close to the continuum until both rotated in opposite directions on day +14.</description>

With its origin coming from several sources (Big Bang, stars, cosmic rays) and given its strong depletion during its stellar lifetime, the lithium element is of great interest as its chemical evolution in the Milky Way is not well understood at present. To help constrain stellar and galactic chemical evolution models, numerous and precise lithium abundances are necessary for a large range of evolutionary stages, metallicities, and Galactic volume.</description>

This conference proceedings paper provides a short summary of the constraints presented by Menci et al. (2020) and Menci et al. (2022) to dynamical dark energy models. Dynamical dark energy (DDE) models have been proposed to address several observational tensions arising within the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario. Different DDE models, parameterized by different combinations of the local value of the equation-of-state parameter $w_0$ and its time derivative $w_a$, predict different maximal abundance of massive galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

We have estimated the magnetic field strengths of a sample of seven galaxies using their non-thermal synchrotron radio emission at metre wavelengths, and assuming energy equipartition between magnetic fields and cosmic ray particles. Spatially resolved star formation rates (SFR) were estimated for the seven galaxies along with five galaxies studied previously. For the combined sample of twelve galaxies, the equipartition magnetic fields (B$\textrm{eq}$) are correlated with the SFR surface densities ($\Sigma\textrm{SFR}$) at sub-kpc scales with B$\textrm{eq}$ $\propto$ $\Sigma\textrm{SFR}^ {0.</description>

AGN-driven outflows are now routinely used in models of galaxy evolution as a feedback mechanism, however many of their properties remain highly uncertain. Perhaps the greatest source of uncertainty is the electron density of the outflowing gas, which directly affects derived kinetic powers and mass outflow rates. Here we present spatially-resolved, wide spectral-coverage Xshooter observations of the nearby active galaxy IC 5063 (z=0.001131), which shows clear signatures of outflows being driven by shocks induced by a radio jet interacting with the ISM.</description>

The kinematic disturbances associated with major galaxy mergers are known to produce gas inflows, which in turn may trigger accretion onto the supermassive black holes (SMBH) of the participant galaxies. While this effect has been studied in galaxy pairs, the frequency of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in fully coalesced post-merger systems is poorly constrained due to the limited size or impurity of extant post-merger samples.</description>

A suggested model for quasi&amp;ndash;periodic eruptions (QPEs) from galaxy nuclei invokes a white dwarf in an eccentric orbit about the central massive black hole. I point out that the extreme mass ratio allows the presence of strong Lindblad resonances in the accretion disc. These are important for the stability of mass transfer, and may trigger the eruptions themselves by rapidly transferring angular momentum from the accretion disc (which is likely to be eccentric itself) to the orbiting WD companion at pericentre.</description>

Methods based on Deep Learning have recently been applied on astrophysical parameter recovery thanks to their ability to capture information from complex data. One of these methods is the approximate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) which have demonstrated to yield consistent posterior distribution into the parameter space, helpful for uncertainty quantification. However, as any modern neural networks, they tend to produce overly confident uncertainty estimates and can introduce bias when BNNs are applied to data.</description>

      <description>First author: C. Cold
Type IIn supernovae potentially constitute a large fraction of the gravitationally lensed supernovae predicted to be found with upcoming facilities. However, the local rate is used for these estimates, which is assumed to be independent of properties such as the host galaxy mass. Some studies hint that a host galaxy mass bias may exist for IIn supernovae. This paper aims to provide an updated local IIn supernova-to-core-collapse ratio based on data from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS).</description>

      <description>First author: Callum Witten
Although low-mass star-forming galaxies are the leading candidates of the reionisation process, we cannot conclusively rule out high-mass star-forming galaxies as candidates. While most simulations indicate the former is the best candidate some models suggest that at z &amp;gt; 6 massive, UV-bright galaxies - &amp;ldquo;oligarchs&amp;rdquo; - account for at least 80% of the ionising budget. To test this hypothesis we target massive (log10 (M*$[Msol]$) &amp;gt; 10), UV-bright (MUV ~ -22) Lya emitters at z &amp;gt; 7 in archival data, observed with similar resolution spectrographs (VLT/X-shooter and Keck/MOSFIRE).</description>

The timescales on which galaxies move out of the blue cloud to the red sequence ($\tau^{}\mathrm{Q}$) provide insight into the mechanisms driving quenching. Here, we build upon previous work, where we showcased a method to reconstruct the colour evolution of observed low-redshift galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey based on spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with ProSpect, together with a statistically-driven definition for the blue and red populations.</description>

Using the analytical framework, we demonstrate that the observed hot spots may not be disjoint elements but causally linked components (&amp;ldquo;petals&amp;rdquo;) of one rotating quasi-stationary macro-structure formed in the thermo-vorticial field within the accretion disk.</description>

      <description>First author: Bradley C. Whitmore
A long-standing problem when deriving the physical properties of stellar populations is the degeneracy between age, reddening, and metallicity. When a single metallicity is used for all star clusters in a galaxy, this degeneracy can result in $$catastrophic$&#39;$ errors for old globular clusters. Typically, approximately 10 - 20 % of all clusters detected in spiral galaxies can have ages that are incorrect by a factor of ten or more.</description>

Observations of the first billion years of cosmic history are currently limited. We demonstrate the synergy between observations of the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen and interferometric measurements of the corresponding spatial fluctuations. By jointly analysing data from SARAS3 (redshift $z\approx15-25$) and limits from HERA ($z\approx8$ and $10$), we produce the tightest constraints to date on the astrophysics of galaxies 200 million years after the Big Bang.</description>

The spectrum ranges from 4-14 um, and shows many unique qualities including a flat-topped $[Ar III]$ 8.991 um profile, a strongly tilted $[Co III]$ 11.888 um feature, and multiple stable Ni lines.

We present a free-form model of SMACS0723, the first cluster observed with JWST. This model makes no strong assumptions about the distribution of mass (mostly dark matter) in the cluster and we use it to study the possible correlation between dark matter with the intracluster light and distribution of globular clusters. To explore the uncertainty in mass modelling, we derive three lens models based on spectroscopically confirmed systems and new candidate systems with redshifts predicted by the lens model derived from the spectroscopic systems.</description>

The introduction of deep wide-field surveys in recent years and the adoption of machine learning techniques have led to the discoveries of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ strong gravitational lensing systems and candidates. However, the discovery of multiply lensed transients remains a rarity. Lensed transients and especially lensed supernovae are invaluable tools to cosmology as they allow us to constrain cosmological parameters via lens modeling and the measurements of their time delays.</description>

      <description>Francois Hammer
Halo inhabitants are individual stars, stellar streams, star and globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies. Here we compare the two last categories that include objects of similar stellar mass, which are often studied as self-dynamical equilibrium systems. We discover that the half-light radius of globular clusters depends on their orbital pericenter and total energy, and that Milky Way (MW) tides may explain the observed correlation. We also suggest that the accretion epoch of stellar systems in the MW halo can be calibrated by the total orbital energy, and that such a relation is due to both the mass growth of the MW and dynamical friction affecting mostly satellites with numerous orbits.</description>

We present the radio-EBL at 150 MHz, 325 MHz, 610 MHz, 1.4 GHz, 3 GHz, 5 GHz, and 8.4 GHz. In all cases the contribution to the radio-EBL, per decade of flux, exhibits a two-humped distribution well matched to the AGN and star-forming galaxy (SFG) populations, and with each population contributing roughly equal energy.</description>

Subsonic turbulence plays a major role in determining properties of the intra cluster medium (ICM). We introduce a new Meshless Finite Mass (MFM) implementation in OpenGadget3 and apply it to this specific problem. To this end, we present a set of test cases to validate our implementation of the MFM framework in our code. These include but are not limited to: the soundwave and Kepler disk as smooth situations to probe the stability, a Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability as popular mixing instabilities, a blob test as more complex example including both mixing and shocks, shock tubes with various Mach numbers, a Sedov blast wave, different tests including self-gravity such as gravitational freefall, a hydrostatic sphere, the Zeldovich-pancake, and the nifty cluster as cosmological application.</description>

First, we analyze three cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (Eagle, Illustris, and IllustrisTNG), selecting snapshots spanning the bulk of cosmic history from comic noon ($z \sim 2$) to the present epoch, with stellar masses in the range $9 &amp;lt; \log(M_/M_{\odot}) &amp;lt; 12$.</description>

Stellar-mass black holes can become embedded within the gaseous disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Afterwards, their interactions are mediated by their gaseous surroundings. In this work, we study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded within AGN disks using a combination of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and analytic methods, focusing on environments in which the AGN disk scale height $H$ is [arXiv:2301.03629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03629)$\gtrsim$ the BBH sphere of influence.</description>

Thermonuclear and core-collapse supernova remnants (SNRs) are the nebular leftovers of defunct stars. Their morphology and emission properties provide insights into the evolutionary history of the progenitor star. But while some SNRs are spherical, as expected from a point-like explosion expanding into a roughly uniform medium, many others exhibit complex non-spherical morphologies which are often not easily explained. In this work, we use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to show that rectangular and jet-like morphologies can be explained by supernovae (SNe), either type Ia or type II, expanding within anisotropic, bipolar stellar wind bubbles driven by the progenitor star.</description>

Dwarf galaxies located in extremely under-dense cosmic voids are excellent test-beds for disentangling the effects of large-scale environment on galaxy formation and evolution. We present integral field spectroscopy for low-mass galaxies ($M_{\star}=10^{7}-10^{9}~M_{\odot}$) located inside (N=21) and outside (N=9) cosmic voids using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). Using measurements of stellar line-of-sight rotational velocity $v_{\mathrm{rot}}$ and velocity dispersion $œÉ_{\star}$, we test the tidal stirring hypothesis, which posits that dwarf spheroidal galaxies are formed through tidal interactions with more massive host galaxies.</description>

Details of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion mechanism still need to be fully understood. There is an increasing number of successful examples of reproducing explosions in multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations, but subsequent studies pointed out that the growth rates of the explosion energy $\dot{E}\mathrm{expl}$ of these simulations are insufficient to produce enough $^{56}$Ni to match observations. This issue is known as the `$^{56}$Ni problem&#39; in CCSNe. Recently, however, some studies have suggested that this $^{56}$Ni problem is derived from the simplicity of the explosion model.</description>

Cluster galaxies are subject to the ram pressure exerted by the intracluster medium, which can perturb or even strip away their gas while leaving the stars unperturbed. We model the distribution and kinematics of the stars and the molecular gas in four late-type cluster galaxies (JO201, JO204, JO206, and JW100), which show tails of atomic and ionized gas indicative of ongoing ram pressure stripping. We analyze MUSE@VLT data and CO data from ALMA searching for signatures of radial gas flows, ram pressure stripping, and other perturbations.</description>

The existence of multiple active galactic nuclei (AGN) at small projected distances on the sky is due to either the presence of multiple, in-spiraling SMBHs, or to gravitational lensing of a single AGN. Both phenomena allow us to address important astrophysical and cosmological questions. However, few kpc-separation multiple AGN are currently known. Recently, the newly-developed Gaia Multi peak (GMP) method provided numerous new candidate members of these populations.</description>

The cosmological principle states that the Universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic at large distance scales. There currently exist many observations which indicate a departure from this principle. It has been shown that many of these observations can be explained by invoking superhorizon cosmological perturbations and may be consistent with the Big Bang paradigm. Remarkably, these modes simultaneously explain the observed Hubble tension, i.e., the discrepancy between the direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble parameter.</description>

As luminous Lyman-alpha nebulae have been shown to trace overdense environments at z~2-3, comparing the properties of galaxies within Lyman-alpha nebulae systems to those in the field can provide insight into how and when locally-observed trends between galaxy properties and environment emerged. Six Lyman-alpha nebulae were discovered at z~2.</description>

We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) K-band (19 GHz) observations of the redshifted CO(1-0) line emission toward the radio galaxy TN J0924$-$2201 at $z=5.2$, which is one of the most distant CO-detected radio galaxies. With the angular resolution of $\sim2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;$, the CO(1-0) line emission is resolved into three clumps, within $\pm500$ km,s$^{-1}$ relative to its redshift, where is determined by Ly$\alpha$. We find that they locate off-center and 12-33 kpc away from the center of the host galaxy, which has counterparts in $HST$ $i$-band, $Spitzer$/IRAC and ALMA Band-6 (230 GHz; 1.</description>

      <description>First author: Remudin Reshid Mekuria
In this work, we consider an interacting dark-fluid cosmological model in which energy exchange between dark matter and dark energy occurs through diffusion. After solving the background expansion history for a late-time universe, we attempt to constrain the cosmological parameters by comparing simulated values of the model against Supernovae Type 1A data. We consider four different cases and compare them against the LCDM model as the &amp;ldquo;true model&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>First author: I. Baraffe
We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of core convection for zero-age-main-sequence stars covering a mass range from 3 $M_\odot$ to 20 $M_\odot$. The simulations are performed with the fully compressible time-implicit code MUSIC. We study the efficiency of overshooting, which describes the ballistic process of convective flows crossing a convective boundary, as a function of stellar mass and luminosity. We also study the impact of artificially increasing the stellar luminosity for 3 $M_\odot$ models.</description>

      <description>First author: Sheean Jolicoeur
Surveys of the matter distribution contain `fossil&amp;rsquo; information on possible non-Gaussianity that is generated in the primordial Universe. This primordial signal survives only on the largest scales where cosmic variance is strongest. By combining different surveys in a multi-tracer approach, we can suppress the cosmic variance and significantly improve the precision on the level of primordial non-Gaussianity. We consider a combination of an optical galaxy survey, like the recently initiated DESI survey, together with a new and very different type of survey, a 21 cm intensity mapping survey, like the upcoming SKAO survey.</description>

Cross-correlating the data of neutral hydrogen (HI) 21cm intensity mapping with galaxy surveys is an effective method to extract astrophysical and cosmological information. In this work, we investigate the cross-correlation of MeerKAT single-dish mode HI intensity mapping and China Space Station Telescope (CSST) spectroscopic galaxy surveys. We simulate a survey area of $\sim 300$ $\mathrm{deg}^2$ of MeerKAT and CSST surveys at $z=0.5$ using Multi-Dark N-body simulation.</description>

      <description>First author: Alex McDaniel
Many star-forming galaxies and those hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) show evidence of massive outflows of material in a variety of phases including ionized, neutral atomic, and molecular. Molecular outflows in particular have been the focus of recent interest as they may be responsible for removing gas from the galaxy, thereby suppressing star formation. As material is ejected from the cores of galaxies, interactions of the outflowing material with the interstellar medium can accelerate cosmic rays and produce high-energy gamma rays.</description>

We use the MIRI and NIRSpec instruments to obtain integral-field spectroscopy of the heavily obscured Eastern nucleus (V114E) and surrounding regions. The spatially resolved, high-resolution, spectra reveal the physical conditions in the gas and dust over a projected area of 2-3 kpc that includes the two brightest IR sources, the NE and SW cores.</description>

      <description>Alexandra Le Reste
Around 400 million years after the big bang, ultraviolet emission (Lyman Continuum, LyC) from star-forming galaxies drove the reionization of the Universe. How this radiation escapes the cold neutral gas (HI) of galaxies with sufficiently little absorption to reionize the intergalactic medium is poorly understood. HI has never been mapped in confirmed LyC-emitters, leaving major uncertainties on how LyC photons escape galaxies and ionize the intergalactic medium.</description>

We present the Rhapsody-C simulations that extend the Rhapsody-G suite of massive galaxy clusters at the $M_{\rm vir}\sim10^{15}\thinspace{\rm M}_{\odot}$ scale with cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations that include anisotropic thermal conduction, modified supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback, new SMBH seeding and SMBH orbital decay model. These modelling improvements have a dramatic effect on the SMBH growth, star formation and gas depletion in the proto-clusters. We explore the parameter space of the models and report their effect on both star formation and the thermodynamics of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) as observed in X-ray and SZ observations.</description>

Recent observations by James Webb Space Telescope discovered a number of high-redshift galaxies with strong emission lines from doubly ionized oxygen. Combined with ALMA observations of far-infrared lines, multi-line diagnostics can be applied to the high-redshift galaxies in order to probe the physical conditions of the inter-stellar medium. We study the formation and evolution of galaxies using the FirstLight simulation suite, which provides outputs of 62 high-resolution, zoom-in galaxy simulations.</description>

      <description>First author: Anowar J. Shajib
Strong-lensing time delays enable measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$) independently of other traditional methods. The main limitation to the precision of time-delay cosmography is mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD). Some of the previous TDCOSMO analyses broke the MSD by making standard assumptions about the mass density profile of the lens galaxy, reaching 2% precision from seven lenses. However, this approach could potentially bias the $H_0$ measurement or underestimate the errors.</description>

Using 190,000 spectra from the seventeenth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the ultraviolet emission line properties in z=2 quasars. Specifically, we quantify how the shape of CIV 1549A and the equivalent width (EW) of HeII 1640A depend on the black hole mass and Eddington ratio inferred from MgII 2800A. Above L/L_Edd&amp;gt;0.2, there is a strong mass dependence in both CIV blueshift and HeII EW.</description>

In November 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) returned deep near-infrared images of Abell~2744 &amp;ndash; a powerful lensing cluster capable of magnifying distant, incipient galaxies beyond it. Together with the existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, this publicly available dataset opens a fundamentally new discovery space to understand the remaining mysteries of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. In this work, we detect and measure some 50,000 objects across the 45 arcmin$^2$ JWST footprint down to a $5,\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $\sim$29.</description>

In this manuscript, an independent method is proposed to estimate opening angle of dust torus in AGN, through unique properties of Type-1.9 AGN with double-peaked broad H$\alpha$ (Type-1.9 DPAGN) coming from central accretion disk. Type-1.9 AGN without broad H$\beta$ can be expected by the commonly accepted unified model of AGN, considering central BLRs seriously obscured by dust torus with its upper boundary in the line of sight.</description>

Next-generation spectroscopic surveys such as the MegaMapper, MUltiplexed Survey Telescope (MUST), MaunaKea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE), and Wide Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) are foreseen to increase the number of galaxy/quasar redshifts by an order of magnitude, with hundred millions of spectra that will be measured at $z&amp;gt;2$. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis for these surveys on the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO), the redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurement, the non-Gaussianity amplitude $f_{\rm NL}$, and the total neutrino mass $M_\nu$.</description>

Studying coupling between different galactic components is a challenging problem in galactic dynamics. Using basis function expansions (BFEs) and multichannel singular spectrum analysis (mSSA) as a means of dynamical data mining, we discover evidence for two multi-component disc-halo dipole modes in a Milky-Way-like simulated galaxy. One of the modes grows throughout the simulation, while the other decays throughout the simulation. The multi-component disc-halo modes are driven primarily by the halo, and have implications for the structural evolution of galaxies, including observations of lopsidedness and other non-axisymmetric structure.</description>

The growth of instabilities is key to trigger a supernova explosion during the phase of stalled shock, immediately after the birth of a proto-neutron star (PNS). We assess the effect of stellar rotation on neutrino-driven convection and SASI when neutrino heating is taken into account. Rotation affects the frequency of the mode m=2 detectable with gravitational waves (GW). We use a linear stability analysis in the equatorial plane between the PNS and the stationary shock and consider a large range of specific angular momenta, neutrino luminosities and mass accretion rates.</description>

Previous studies have shown that the normalization and scatter of the galaxy &amp;lsquo;main sequence&amp;rsquo; (MS), the relation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass ($M_$), evolves over cosmic time. However, such studies often rely on photometric redshifts and/or only rest-frame UV to near-IR data, which may underestimate the SFR and $M_$ uncertainties. We use MAGPHYS+photo-z to fit the UV to radio spectral energy distributions of 12,380 galaxies in the COSMOS field at $0.</description>

The proper motions of 120 individual knots of oxygen-rich gas were measured and used to calculate a center of expansion (CoE) of $\alpha$=05:25:01.71 and $\delta$=-69:38:41.64 (J2000) with a 1-$\sigma$ uncertainty of 2.90 arcseconds. This new CoE measurement is 9.</description>

We compare the observed radial velocity of different arm tracers, taken near the tangent to a spiral arm. A slight difference is predicted by the density wave theory, given the shock predicted at the entrance to the inner spiral arm. In many of these spiral arms, the observed velocity offset confirms the prediction of the density wave theory (with a separation between the maser velocity and the CO gas peak velocity, of about 20 km/s) - when the observed offset is bigger than the error estimates.</description>

      <description>First author: Chris Nagele
The assembly of supermassive black holes poses a challenge primarily because of observed quasars at high redshift, but additionally because of the current lack of observations of intermediate mass black holes. One plausible scenario for creating supermassive black holes is direct collapse triggered by the merger of two gas rich galaxies. This scenario allows the creation of supermassive stars with up to solar metallicity, where the enhanced metallicity is enabled by extremely rapid accretion.</description>

Line ratio diagnostics provide valuable clues on the source of ionizing radiation in galaxies with intense black hole accretion and starbursting events, like local Seyfert or galaxies at the peak of the star-formation history. We aim at providing a reference joint optical and mid-IR analysis for studying AGN identification via line ratios and test predictions from photoionization models. We obtained homogenous optical spectra with the Southern Africa Large Telescope for 42 Seyfert galaxies with IRS/Spitzer spectroscopy and X-ray to mid-IR multi-band data available.</description>

We study the spatially resolved stellar populations of 444 galaxies at $0.3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;6.0$ in two clusters (WHL0137-08 and MACS0647+70) and a blank field, combining imaging data from HST and JWST to perform spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling using pixedfit. The high spatial resolution of the imaging data combined with magnification from gravitational lensing in the cluster fields allows us to resolve some galaxies to sub-kpc scales (for 109 of our galaxies).</description>

We use data from the 17th data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE 2) to contrast the chemical composition of the recently discovered Gaia Enceladus/Sausage system (GE/S) to those of ten Milky Way (MW) dwarf satellite galaxies: LMC, SMC, Bo&amp;quot;otes I, Carina, Draco, Fornax, Sagittarius, Sculptor, Sextans and Ursa Minor. Our main focus is on the distributions of the stellar populations of those systems in the $[Mg/Fe]$-$[Fe/H]$ and $[Mg/Mn]$-$[Al/Fe]$ planes, which are commonly employed in the literature for chemical diagnosis and where dwarf galaxies can be distinguished from in situ populations.</description>

Alternative cosmological models have been under deep scrutiny in recent years, aiming to address the main shortcomings of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, as the accuracy of cosmological surveys improved, new tensions have risen between the model-dependent analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background and lower redshift probes. Within this framework, we review two quantum-inspired non-locally extended theories of gravity, whose main cosmological feature is a geometrically driven accelerated expansion.</description>

      <description>First author: Andrew King
A suggested model for quasi&amp;ndash;periodic eruptions (QPEs) from galaxy nuclei invokes a white dwarf in an eccentric orbit about the central massive black hole. I point out that the extreme mass ratio allows the presence of strong Lindblad resonances in the accretion disc. These are important for the stability of mass transfer, and may trigger the eruptions themselves by rapidly transferring angular momentum from the accretion disc (which is likely to be eccentric itself) to the orbiting WD companion at pericentre.</description>

We have observed the z=4.3 protocluster SPT2349-56 with ATCA with the aim of detecting radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) amongst the ~30 submillimeter galaxies identified in the structure. We detect the central complex of SMGs at 2.2,GHz with a luminosity of L_2.2=(4.42pm0.56)x10^{25} W/Hz. The ASKAP also detects the source at 888 MHz, constraining the radio spectral index to alpha=-1.6pm0.3, consistent with ATCA non-detections at 5.</description>

We present cosmological constraints from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) first-year weak lensing shear catalogue using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and conventional summary statistics. We crop 19 $3\times3,\mathrm{{deg}^2}$ sub-fields from the first-year area, divide the galaxies with redshift $0.3\le z\le1.5$ into four equally-spaced redshift bins, and perform tomographic analyses. We develop a pipeline to generate simulated convergence maps from cosmological $N$-body simulations, where we account for effects such as intrinsic alignments (IAs), baryons, photometric redshift errors, and point spread function errors, to match characteristics of the real catalogue.</description>

The high-redshift cluster shows clear signs of being relaxed with well-regulated feedback from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Using Chandra X-ray data, we construct thermodynamic profiles and determine the properties of the intracluster medium.</description>

Molecular hydrogen allows cooling in primordial gas, facilitating its collapse into Population III stars within primordial halos. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from these stars can escape the halo and delay further star formation by destroying H$2$ in other halos. As cosmological simulations show that increasing the background LW field strength increases the average halo mass required for star formation, we perform follow-up simulations of selected halos to investigate the knock-on effects this has on the Population III IMF.</description>

JWST high redshift galaxy observations predict a higher star formation efficiency than the standard cosmology does, which poses a new tension to $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the situation is worse than expected. The true situation is that the Planck CMB measurement has a strong tension with JWST high redshift galaxy observations. Specifically, we make a trial to alleviate this tension by considering alternative cosmological models including dark matter-baryon interaction, $f(R)$ gravity and dynamical dark energy.</description>

Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) mark the explosive death of red supergiants (RSGs), evolved massive stars with an extended hydrogen envelope. They are the most common supernova type and allow for benchmarking of supernova explosion models by statistical comparison to observed population properties rather than comparing individual models and events. We construct a large synthetic set of SNe IIP light curves (LCs) using the radiation hydrodynamics code \texttt{SNEC} and explosion energies and nickel masses obtained from an efficient semi-analytic model for two different sets of stellar progenitor models.</description>

Double radio lobes are generally believed to be produced by active nuclei of elliptical galaxies. However, several double-lobed radio sources have been solidly found to be associated with spiral galaxies. By cross-matching $\sim9\times10^5$ spiral galaxies selected from the SDSS DR8 data with the full 1.4-GHz radio source catalogs of NVSS and FIRST, we identify three new spiral galaxies: J0326$-$0623, J1110+0321 and J1134+3046 that produce double radio lobes, in addition to five double-lobed spirals previously known.</description>

The Universe expansion rate is modulated around local inhomogeneities due to their gravitational potential. Velocity waves are then observed around galaxy clusters in the Hubble diagram. This paper studies them in a ~738 Mpc wide, with 2048^3 particles, cosmological simulation of our cosmic environment (a.k.a. CLONE: Constrained LOcal &amp;amp; Nesting Environment Simulation). For the first time, the simulation shows that velocity waves that arise in the lines-of-sight of the most massive dark matter halos agree with those observed in local galaxy velocity catalogs in the lines-of-sight of Coma and several other local (Abell) clusters.</description>
