      <description>First author: Joon Hyeop Lee
We introduce a practical methodology for investigating the star formation and chemical evolution history of a galaxy: age-divided mean stellar populations (ADPs) from full spectrum fitting. In this method, the mass-weighted mean stellar populations and mass fractions (f_mass) of young and old stellar components in a galaxy are separately estimated, which are divided with an age cut (selected to be 10^9.5 yr ~ 3.2 Gyr in this paper).</description>

      <description>First author: Aliza G. Beverage
We present elemental abundance patterns (C, N, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni) for a population of 135 massive quiescent galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ with ultra-deep rest-frame optical spectroscopy drawn from the LEGA-C survey. We derive average ages and elemental abundances in four bins of stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) ranging from 150$~$km$,$s$^{-1}$ to 250$~$km$,$s$^{-1}$ using a full-spectrum hierarchical Bayesian model. The resulting elemental abundance measurements are precise to 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Xia Zhang
Cyanamide (NH2CN) and its isomer, carbodiimide (HNCNH), may form adenine in the interstellar medium (ISM) via a series of reactions. Therefore, they are considered key prebiotic molecules in the study of the origin of life. We used the three-phase NAUTILUS chemical code, which includes the gas, the dust surface, and the icy mantle, to investigate the formation and destruction of cyanamide and carbodiimide. We added over 200 new chemical reactions of the two isomers and related species, and established a relatively complete network.</description>

      <description>First author: Yahya Nasolo
We present a chemical abundance analysis of seven A-type stars with no detailed chemical abundance measurements in the literature. High-resolution spectra of the targets HD 2924, HD 4321, HD 26553, HD 125658, HD 137928, HD 154713, and HD 159834 were obtained using the Coude Echelle Spectrograph at the TUBITAK National Observatory. We determined the atmospheric abundances of the samples and measured the elemental abundances of C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd.</description>

      <description>First author: P. Noterdaeme
Proximate molecular quasar absorbers (PH2) are an intriguing population of absorption systems recently uncovered through strong H2 absorption at small velocity separation from the background quasars. We performed a multi-wavelength spectroscopic follow-up of thirteen such systems with VLT/X-Shooter. Here, we present the observations and study the overall chemical enrichment measured from the HI, H2 and metal lines. We combine this with an investigation of the neutral gas kinematics with respect to the quasar host.</description>

For the first time, the sulphur abundance relative to hydrogen (S/H) in the Narrow Line Regions of a sample of Seyfert 2 nuclei (Sy 2s) has been derived via direct estimation of the electron temperature. Narrow emission line intensities from the SDSS DR17 [in the wavelength range 3000 &amp;lt; $\lambda$ &amp;lt; 9100] and from the literature for a sample of 45 nearby ($z$ &amp;lt; 0.</description>

      <description>First author: Elspeth K. H. Lee
The chemical inventory of hot Jupiter (HJ) exoplanets atmospheres continue to be observed by various ground and space based instruments in increasing detail and precision. It is expected that some HJs will exhibit strong non-equilibrium chemistry characteristics in their atmospheres, which might be inferred from spectral observations. We aim to model the three dimensional thermochemical non-equilibrium chemistry in the atmospheres of the HJs WASP-39b and HD 189733b.</description>

      <description>First author: Riano E. Giribaldi
The Milky Way accreted several smaller satellite galaxies in its history. These mergers added stars and gas to the Galaxy and affected the properties of the pre-existing stellar populations. Stellar chemical abundances and ages are needed to establish the chronological order of events that occur before, during, and after such mergers. We report precise ages ($\sim$6.5%) and chemical abundances for the Titans, a sample of old metal-poor dwarfs and subgiants with accurate atmospheric parameters.</description>

      <description>First author: Debby Tran
KOSMOS is a low-resolution, long-slit, optical spectrograph that has been upgraded at the University of Washington for its move from Kitt Peak National Observatory&amp;rsquo;s Mayall 4m telescope to the Apache Point Observatory&amp;rsquo;s ARC 3.5m telescope. One of the additions to KOSMOS is a slitviewer, which requires the fabrication of reflective slits, as KOSMOS previously used matte slits machined via wire EDM. We explore a novel method of slit fabrication using nanofabrication methods and compare the slit edge roughness, width uniformity, and the resulting scattering of the new fabricated slits to the original slits.</description>

      <description>First author: Pablo Santos-Peral
The X-shooter Spectral Library (XSL) is a large empirical stellar library used as a benchmark for the development of stellar population models. The inclusion of $\alpha$-elements abundances is crucial to disentangling the chemical evolution of any stellar system. The aim of this paper is to provide a catalogue of high-precision and accurate magnesium and calcium abundances from a wide variety of stars well distributed in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram.</description>

      <description>First author: Efrain Gatuzz
We present a detailed analysis of the elemental abundances distribution of the Virgo cluster using {\it XMM-Newton} observations. We included in the analysis a new EPIC-pn energy scale calibration which allow us to measure velocities with uncertainties down to $\Delta v \sim 150$ km/s. We investigate the radial distribution of O, Ne, Mg, Si, Ar, S, Ca, Ni and Fe. We found that the best-fit model is close to a single-temperature component for distances $&amp;gt;80$~kpc and the cooler gas is more metal-rich.</description>

The chemical composition of gas in galaxies can be measured in detail from absorption spectroscopy. By studying gas in galaxies in this way, it is possible to investigate the small and faint galaxies, which are the most numerous in the universe. In particular, the chemical distribution of gas in absorbing systems gives us insight into cycles of gas in and around galaxies. Here we study chemical enrichment within 64 Damped Lyman-alpha Absorption (DLA) systems between $1.</description>

We present the chemical composition of 206 red giant branch stars members of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using optical, high-resolution spectra collected with the multi-object spectrograph FLAMES-GIRAFFE at the ESO Very Large Telescope. This sample includes stars in three fields located in different positions within the parent galaxy. We analysed the main groups of elements, namely light- (Na), alpha- (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), iron-peak (Sc, V, Fe, Ni, Cu) and s-process elements (Zr, Ba, La).</description>

Recent observations by James Webb Space Telescope discovered a number of high-redshift galaxies with strong emission lines from doubly ionized oxygen. Combined with ALMA observations of far-infrared lines, multi-line diagnostics can be applied to the high-redshift galaxies in order to probe the physical conditions of the inter-stellar medium. We study the formation and evolution of galaxies using the FirstLight simulation suite, which provides outputs of 62 high-resolution, zoom-in galaxy simulations.</description>

This is the first of a series of papers that will introduce a user-friendly, detailed, and modular GALactic Chemical Evolution Model, GalCEM, that tracks isotope masses as a function of time in a given galaxy. The list of tracked isotopes automatically adapts to the complete set provided by the input yields. The present iteration of GalCEM tracks 86 elements broken down in 451 isotopes. The prescription includes massive stars, low-to-intermediate mass stars, and Type Ia supernovae as enrichment channels.</description>

We review the recent observations of protoplanetary disks together with relevant theoretical studies with an emphasis on the evolution of volatiles. In the last several years Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) provided evidence of grain growth, gas-dust decoupling, and sub-structures such as rings and gaps in the dust continuum. Molecular line observations revealed radial and vertical distributions of molecular abundances and also provided significant constraints on the gas dynamics such as turbulence.</description>

The volcanism plays an important part in mass exchange circle to bring matter from core of planet to atmosphere. Thus, it is a possible method to research the change of elements abundance in atmosphere by modeling the process of volatiles from volcanism get through and mix in atmosphere, which is the focused point of this article. This article penetrates from the generation of volatiles, talks the species, mass, and mole fractions of different typical elements in magma.</description>

We examine star formation and chemical enrichment in protoclusters (PCs) using cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the total star formation rate (SFR) in all PC ($&amp;gt;10^{14.4},h^{-1}$~M$\odot$) reaches $&amp;gt;10^4,\mathrm{M}\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, at $z=3$, equivalent to the observed PCs. The SFR in the Core region accounts for about $30%$ of the total star formation in the PC at $z\gtrsim1$, suggesting the importance of the outer regions to reveal the evolution of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <description>First author: Ryan D. Boyden
The stellar cluster environment is expected to play a central role in the evolution of circumstellar disks. We use thermochemical modeling to constrain the dust and gas masses, disk sizes, UV and X-ray radiation fields, viewing geometries, and central stellar masses of 20 Class II disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We fit a large grid of disk models to $350$ GHz continuum, CO $J=3-2$, and HCO$^+$ $J=4-3$ ALMA observations of each target, and we introduce a procedure for modeling interferometric observations of gas disks detected in absorption against a bright molecular cloud background.</description>

An increase in satellite application has skyrocketed the number of satellites, especially in the low earth orbit (LEO). The major concern today is that these satellites become debris after the end of life, negatively affecting the space environment. As per the International Guidelines of the European Space Agency, it is mandatory to deorbit the satellite within 25 years of its end of life. This paper is aimed to design the solid chemical propellant thruster to deorbit the StudSat II from its original orbit to the lower orbit.</description>

Cosmic rays are relativistic particles that come to the Earth from outer space. Despite a great effort made in both experimental and theoretical research, their origin is still unknown. One of the main keys to understand their nature is the determination of its chemical composition as a function of primary energy. In this paper, we review the measurements of the mass composition above $10^{15}$ eV.</description>

      <description>First author: D. Navarro-Almaida
HCN, HNC, and their isotopologues are ubiquitous molecules that can serve as chemical thermometers and evolutionary tracers to characterize star-forming regions. Despite their importance in carrying information that is vital to studies of the chemistry and evolution of star-forming regions, the collision rates of some of these molecules have not been available for rigorous studies in the past. We perform an up-to-date gas and dust chemical characterization of two different star-forming regions, TMC 1-C and NGC 1333-C7, using new collisional rates of HCN, HNC, and their isotopologues.</description>

      <description>First author: I. A. Zinchenko
We constructed an oxygen abundance map and N/O ratio map of the unusually low excitation dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 4163 based on publicly available spectroscopy obtained by the MaNGA survey. We detected auroral emission line [OII]$\lambda\lambda$7320,7330 which allows us to measure chemical abundance by direct T$_e$ method. We found that the scatter of the oxygen abundance derived by the strong line method is large. The oxygen abundances 12 + log(O/H) derived by strong line method vary from ~7.</description>

      <description>First author: Lia C. Corazza
We propose a semi-analytic model that is developed to understand the cosmological evolution of the mean metallicity in the Universe. In particular, we study the contributions of Population III (Pop III) and Population II (Pop II) stars to the production of $\mathrm{Fe,~Si,~Zn, ~Ni,~P, ~Mg, ~Al, ~S, ~C, ~N}$, and $\mathrm{~O}$. We aim to quantify the roles of two different models in the chemical enrichment of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Differences in chemical evolution between isolated and embedded prestellar cores</title>

      <description>First author: F. D. Priestley
Models of prestellar cores often assume that the cores are isolated from their environment - material outside the core boundary plays no role in the subsequent evolution. This is unlikely to be the case in reality, where cores are located within hierarchically substructured molecular clouds. We investigate the dynamical and chemical evolution of prestellar cores, modelled as Bonnor-Ebert spheres, and show that the density of the ambient medium has a large impact on the resulting chemical properties of the cores.</description>

      <title>From Galactic Chemical Evolution to Cosmic Supernova Rates Synchronized with Core-Collapse Supernovae Limited to the Narrow Progenitor Mass Range</title>

      <description>First author: Takuji Tsujimoto
Massive ($\geq$8 $M_\odot$) stars perish via one of two fates: core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which release synthesized heavy elements, or failed supernovae, thereby forming black holes. In the conventional Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) scheme, a substantial portion of massive stars, e.g., all stars in the mass range of 8-100 $M_{\odot},$ are assumed to enrich the Galaxy with their nucleosynthetic products. However, this hypothesis conflicts with the observations, namely, few CCSNe whose progenitor stars are more massive than $\sim$18 $M_{\odot}.</description>

      <description>First author: M. P. Roriz
We present detailed chemical compositions of four stars on the first-ascent red giant branch that are classified as chemically peculiar, but lack comprehensive analyses at high spectral resolution. For BD+03{\deg}2688, HE 0457-1805, HE 1255-2324, and HE 2207-1746, we derived metallicities [Fe/H] $=-1.21$, $-0.19$, $-0.31$, and $-0.55$, respectively, indicating a range in Galactic population membership. In addition to atmospheric parameters, we extracted elemental abundances for 28 elements, including the evolutionary-sensitive CNO group and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios.</description>

      <description>First author: P. B. Changala
We report the detection of magnesium dicarbide, MgC$_2$, in the laboratory at centimeter wavelengths and assign $^{24}$MgC$_2$, $^{25}$MgC$_2$, and $^{26}$MgC$_2$ to 14 unidentified lines in the radio spectrum of the circumstellar envelope of the evolved carbon star IRC+10216. The structure of MgC$_2$ is found to be T-shaped with a highly ionic bond between the metal atom and the C$_2$ unit, analogous to other dicarbides containing electropositive elements.</description>

      <description>First author: Christian Eistrup
[Abridged] This review paper discussed which chemical effects may be at play in a planet-forming disk midplane, which effects are relevant under different conditions, and which tools are available for modelling chemical kinetics in a disk midplane. The review goes on to discuss some important efforts in the planet formation modelling community to treat chemical evolution, and, vice versa, efforts in the chemical modelling community to implement more physical effects related to planet formation into the chemical modelling.</description>

      <description>First author: Laura Fernandes
We use data from the 17th data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE 2) to contrast the chemical composition of the recently discovered Gaia Enceladus/Sausage system (GE/S) to those of ten Milky Way (MW) dwarf satellite galaxies: LMC, SMC, Bo&amp;quot;otes I, Carina, Draco, Fornax, Sagittarius, Sculptor, Sextans and Ursa Minor. Our main focus is on the distributions of the stellar populations of those systems in the $[Mg/Fe]$-$[Fe/H]$ and $[Mg/Mn]$-$[Al/Fe]$ planes, which are commonly employed in the literature for chemical diagnosis and where dwarf galaxies can be distinguished from in situ populations.</description>
