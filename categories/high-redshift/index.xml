      <description>First author: Q. D&amp;rsquo;Amato
We present deep L-Band observations of the equatorial field centered on the z=6.3 SDSS QSO, reaching a 1 sigma sensitivity of ~2.5 uJy at the center of the field. We extracted a catalog of 1489 radio sources down to a flux density of ~12.5 uJy (5 sigma) over a field of view of ~ 30&amp;rsquo; diameter. We derived the source counts accounting for catalog reliability and completeness, and compared them with others available in the literature.</description>

The appearance of galaxies over the first billion years after the Big Bang is believed to be responsible for the last dramatic change in the state of the Universe. Ultraviolet photons from galaxies within this time period - the Epoch of Reionization - ionized intergalactic Hydrogen, rendering the Universe transparent to UV radiation and ending the so-called cosmic Dark Ages, sometime after redshift $z\sim8$. The majority of ionizing photons in the first few hundred Myrs of cosmic history are thought to derive from galaxies significantly fainter than the characteristic luminosity $L^{}$.</description>

      <description>First author: Laura A. Hayes
We report the detection of a significant ionospheric disturbance in the D-region of Earth&amp;rsquo;s ionosphere which was associated with the massive gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A that occurred on October 9 2022. We identified the disturbance over northern Europe - a result of the increased ionisation by X- and gamma-ray emission from the GRB - using very low frequency (VLF) radio waves as a probe of the D-region.</description>

      <description>First author: Y. Díaz
An interesting feature in active galactic nuclei (AGN) accreting at low rate is the weakness of the reflection features in their X-ray spectra, which can result from the gradual disappearance of the torus with decreasing accretion rates. It has been suggested that low luminosity AGN (LLAGN) would have a different reflector configuration compared with high luminosity AGN, either covering a smaller fraction of the sky or simply having less material.</description>

      <description>First author: Luis Alfredo Anchordoqui
Very recently, the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array collaborations reported strong evidence for a correlation between the highest energy cosmic rays and nearby starburst galaxies, with a global significance post-trial of $4.6\sigma$. It is well known that the collective effect of supernovae and winds from massive stars in the central region of these galaxies drives a galactic-scale superwind that can shock heat and accelerate ambient interstellar or circumgalactic gas.</description>

      <description>First author: Daniel Ceverino
The evolution of star-forming galaxies at high redshifts is very sensitive to the strength and nature of stellar feedback. Using two sets of cosmological, zoom-in simulations from the VELA suite, we compare the effects of two different models of feedback: with and without kinetic feedback. At a fixed halo mass and redshift, the stellar mass is reduced by a factor of 1-3 in the models with stronger feedback, so the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation is in better agreement with abundance matching results.</description>

      <description>First author: Rolf Schlichenmaier
The imaging spectro-polarimeter VTF (Visible Tunable Filter) will be operated at the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). Due to its capability of resolving dynamic fine structure of smaller than 0.05&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, the finite acquisition time of typically 11 s affects the measurement process and potentially causes errors in deduced physical parameters. We estimate those errors and investigate ways of minimising them. We mimic the solar surface using a magneto-hydrodynamic simulation with a spatially averaged vertical field strength of 200 G.</description>

      <description>First author: João Rino-Silvestre
Dust is a major component of the interstellar medium. Through scattering, absorption and thermal re-emission, it can profoundly alter astrophysical observations. Models for dust composition and distribution are necessary to better understand and curb their impact on observations. A new approach for serial and computationally inexpensive production of such models is here presented. Traditionally these models are studied with the help of radiative transfer modelling, a critical tool to understand the impact of dust attenuation and reddening on the observed properties of galaxies and active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>First author: Adrian E. Bayer
Reconstructing the initial conditions of the Universe from late-time observations has the potential to optimally extract cosmological information. Due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space, a differentiable forward model is needed for convergence, and recent advances have made it possible to perform reconstruction with nonlinear models based on galaxy (or halo) positions. In addition to positions, future surveys will provide measurements of galaxies&amp;rsquo; peculiar velocities through the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel&amp;rsquo;dovich effect (kSZ), type Ia supernovae, and the fundamental plane or Tully-Fisher relations.</description>

We investigate the kinematic properties of gas and galaxies in the Local Group (LG) using high-resolution simulations performed by the {\sc Hestia} (High-resolution Environmental Simulations of The Immediate Area) collaboration. Our simulations include the correct cosmography surrounding LG-like regions consisting of two main spiral galaxies of $\sim 10^{12}$~M$_\odot$, their satellites and minor isolated galaxies, all sharing the same large-scale motion within a volume of a few Mpc.</description>

      <description>First author: Ottavio Fornieri
Cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion is the result of the interaction of such charged particles against magnetic fluctuations. These fluctuations originate from large-scale turbulence cascading towards smaller spatial scales, decomposed into three different modes, as described by $magneto-hydro-dynamics$ (MHD) theory. As a consequence, the description of particle diffusion strongly depends on the model describing the injected turbulence. Moreover, the amount of energy assigned to each of the three modes is in general not equally divided, which implies that diffusion properties might be different from one region to another.</description>

      <description>First author: Kohta Murase
We discuss implications that can be obtained by searches for neutrinos from the brightest gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A. We derive constraints on GRB model parameters such as the cosmic-ray loading factor and dissipation radius, taking into account both neutrino spectra and effective areas. The results are strong enough to constrain proton acceleration near the photosphere, and we find that the single burst limits are comparable to those from stacking analysis.</description>

      <description>First author: Nikolay Shakura
We revisit the modal analysis of small perturbations in Keplerian ideal gas flows with constant vertical magnetic field leading to magneto-rotational instability (MRI) using the non-local approach. In the general case, MRI modes are described by a Schr&amp;quot;odinger-like differential equation with some effective potential including &amp;lsquo;repulsive&amp;rsquo; ($1/r^2$) and &amp;lsquo;attractive&amp;rsquo; ($-1/r^3$) terms and are quantized. In shallow potentials, there are no stationary &amp;rsquo;energy levels&amp;rsquo;. In thin Keplerian accretion discs, the perturbation wavelengths $\lambda=2\pi/k_z$ are smaller than the disc semi-thickness $h$ only in &amp;lsquo;deep&amp;rsquo; potential wells.</description>

      <description>First author: So-Myoung Park
We investigate the properties of globular clusters in a galaxy cluster, using the particle tagging method with a semi-analytical approach in a cosmological context. We assume globular clusters form from dark matter halo mergers and their metallicity is assigned based on the stellar mass of the host dark matter halos and the formation redshift of GCs. Dynamical evolution and disruption of globular clusters are considered using semi-analytical approaches, controlled by several free parameters.</description>

The presence of the magnetic field is critical to transport energy through the solar atmosphere. The new generation of telescopes will provide new insight into how the magnetic field arrives into the chromosphere and its role in the energy balance of the solar atmosphere. We have used a 3D radiative MHD numerical model of the solar atmosphere with high spatial resolution (4~km) calculated with the Bifrost code.</description>

We study the effect of super-sample covariance (SSC) on the power spectrum and higher-order statistics: bispectrum, halo mass function, and void size function. We also investigate the effect of SSC on the cross-covariance between the statistics. We consider both the matter and halo fields. Higher-order statistics of the large-scale structure contain additional cosmological information beyond the power spectrum and are a powerful tool to constrain cosmology.</description>

      <description>First author: L. Tsaloukidis
In agreement with the constantly increasing gravitational wave events, new aspects of the internal structure of compact stars can be considered. A scenario in which a first order transition takes place inside these stars is of particular interest as it can lead, under conditions, to a third gravitationally stable branch (besides white dwarfs and neutron stars), the twin stars. The new branch yields stars with the same mass as normal compact stars but quite different radii.</description>

Recent observations of several massive pulsars, with masses near and above $2~M_\odot$, point towards the existence of matter at very high densities, compared to normal matter that we are familiar with in our terrestrial world. This leads to the possibility of appearance of exotic degrees of freedom other than nucleons inside the core of the neutrons stars (NS). Another significant property of NSs is the presence of high surface magnetic field, with highest range of the order of $\sim~10^{16}$ G.</description>

We present a multi-band sequence of $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ images documenting the emergence and evolution of multiple light echoes (LEs) linked to the stripped-envelope supernova (SN) 2016adj located in the central dust-lane of Centaurus A. Following point-spread function subtraction, we identify the earliest LE emission associated with a SN at only $+$34 days (d) past the epoch of $B$-band maximum. Additional HST images extending through $+$578 d cover the evolution of LE1 taking the form of a ring, while images taken on $+$1991 d reveals not only LE1, but also segments of a new inner LE ring (LE2) as well as two additional outer LE rings (LE3 &amp;amp; LE4).</description>

We present the discovery of PSO J191.05696$+$86.43172 (hereafter PSO J191$+$86), a new powerful radio-loud quasar (QSO) in the early Universe (z = 5.32). We discovered it by cross-matching the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) radio catalog at 1.4 GHz with the first data release of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS PS1) in the optical. With a NVSS flux density of 74.2 mJy, PSO J191$+$86 is one of the brightest radio QSO discovered at z$\sim$5.</description>

Massive black holes in the centers of galaxies today must have grown by several orders of magnitude from seed black holes formed at early times. Detecting a population of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) can provide constraints on these elusive BH seeds. Here we use the large volume, cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Astrid, which includes IMBH seeds and dynamical friction to investigate the population of IMBH seeds.</description>

We explore the parameter space for the contribution to Callisto&amp;rsquo;s H corona observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (Roth et al. 2017a) from sublimated H2O and radiolytically produced H2 using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The spatial morphology of this corona produced via photo- and magnetospheric electron impact-induced dissociation is described by tracking the motion of and simulating collisions between the hot H atoms and thermal molecules including a near-surface O2 component.</description>

We present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the morphological and structural properties of a large sample of galaxies at z=3-9 using early JWST CEERS NIRCam observations. Our sample consists of 850 galaxies at z&amp;gt;3 detected in both CANDELS HST imaging and JWST CEERS NIRCam images to enable a comparison of HST and JWST morphologies. Our team conducted a set of visual classifications, with each galaxy in the sample classified by three different individuals.</description>

      <description>First author: Michael Pagano
Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is one of the systematic challenges preventing 21cm interferometric instruments from detecting the Epoch of Reionization. To mitigate the effects of RFI on data analysis pipelines, numerous inpaint techniques have been developed to restore RFI corrupted data. We examine the qualitative and quantitative errors introduced into the visibilities and power spectrum due to inpainting. We perform our analysis on simulated data as well as real data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) Phase 1 upper limits.</description>

We present cosmological results inferred from the effective-field theory (EFT) analysis of the full-shape of eBOSS quasars (QSO) power spectrum. We validate our analysis pipeline against simulations, and find overall good agreement between the analyses in Fourier and configuration space. Keeping the baryon abundance and the spectral tilt fixed, we reconstruct at $68%$ CL the fractional matter abundance $\Omega_m$, the reduced Hubble constant $h$, and the clustering amplitude $\sigma_8$, to respectively $\Omega_m=0.</description>

      <description>First author: Tom Rose
Galaxies often contain large reservoirs of molecular gas which shape their evolution. This can be through cooling of the gas &amp;ndash; which leads to star formation, or accretion onto the central supermassive black hole &amp;ndash; which fuels AGN activity and produces powerful feedback. Molecular gas has been detected in early-type galaxies on scales of just a few tens to hundreds of solar masses by searching for absorption against their compact radio cores.</description>

Magnetic field extrapolation is a fundamental tool to reconstruct the three-dimensional solar coronal magnetic field. However, the prevalently used force-free field model might not be applicable in the lower atmosphere, where plasma \b{eta} is greater than 1. In this work, we perform extrapolation in active region 12158, based on an updated magnetohydrostatic (MHS) method. By comparing the results with those from the force-free field method of Current-Field Iteration in Spherical Coordinates (CFITS), we find that the overall properties, which are characterized by the magnetic free energy and helicity, are roughly the same after volume integral.</description>

Cosmological simulations show that dark matter halos surrounding baryonic disks have a wide range of angular momenta, measured by the spin parameter ($\lambda$). In this study, we bring out the importance of inner angular momentum($&amp;lt;$30 kpc), measured in terms of the halo spin parameter, on the secular evolution of the bar using N-body simulations. We have varied the halo spin parameter $\lambda$ from 0 to 0.</description>

The observation of pits at the surface of comets offers the opportunity to take a glimpse into the properties and the mechanisms that shape a nucleus through cometary activity. If the origin of these pits is still a matter of debate, multiple studies have recently suggested that known phase transitions alone could not have carved these morphological features on the surface of 67P/C-G. We want to understand how the progressive modification of 67P&amp;rsquo;s surface due to cometary activity might have affected the characteristics of pits.</description>

We present a first systematic time series study of a sample of blazars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite $\textit{TESS}$ spacecraft. By cross matching the positions of the sources in the TESS observations with those from Roma-BZCAT, 29 blazars including both BL Lacerate objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars were identified. The observation lengths of the 79 light curves of the sources, across all sectors on which the targets of interest have been observed by $\textit{TESS}$, range between 21.</description>

We investigate archival Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC F140LP observations of NGC~1399 to search for evidence of multiple stellar populations in extragalactic globular clusters. Enhanced FUV populations are thought to be indicators of He-enhanced second generation populations in globular clusters, specifically extreme/blue horizontal branch stars. Out of 149 globular clusters in the field of view, 58 have far ultraviolet (FUV) counterparts with magnitudes brighter than 28.</description>

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered several luminous high-redshift galaxy candidates with stellar masses of $M_{} \gtrsim 10^{9} , \rm{M_{\odot}}$ at photometric redshifts $z_{\mathrm{phot}} \gtrsim 10$ which allows to constrain galaxy and structure formation models. For example, Adams et al. identified the candidate ID 1514 with $\log_{10}(M_{}/M_{\odot}) = {9.8}{-0.2}^{+0.2}$ located at $z{\mathrm{phot}} = 9.85_{-0.12}^{+0.18}$ and Naidu et al. found even more distant candidates labeled as GL-z11 and GL-z13 with $\log_{10}(M_{}/M_{\odot}) = 9.</description>

Broad emitting line regions (BLR) in active galaxies are primarily emitted by photoionization processes that are driven by the incident continuum arising from the underlying, complex geometrical structure, i.e. accretion disk and corona around a supermassive black hole. Modelling the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) effective in ionizing the gas-rich BLR is key to understanding the various radiative processes at play and their importance that eventually leads to the emission of emission lines from diverse physical conditions.</description>

Nyx is a nearby, prograde, and high-eccentricity stellar stream physically contained in the thick disk but with an unknown origin. Nyx could be the remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, in which case the associated dark matter substructure could affect terrestrial dark matter direct detection experiments. Alternatively, Nyx could be a signature of the Milky Way&amp;rsquo;s disk formation and evolution. To determine the origin of Nyx, we obtained high-resolution spectroscopy of 34 Nyx stars using Keck/HIRES and Magellan/MIKE.</description>

In recent years, many questions have arisen regarding the chemistry of photochemical products in the carbon-rich winds of evolved stars. To address them, it is imperative to constrain the distributions of such species through high angular resolution interferometric observations covering multiple rotational transitions. We used archival ALMA observations to map rotational lines involving high energy levels of cyanoacetylene (HC$_3$N) toward the inner envelope (radius &amp;lt;8&amp;quot;/1000 AU) of the carbon star IRC+10216.</description>

The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory~(LHAASO) is one of the most sensitive gamma-ray detector arrays, whose ultrahigh-energy~(UHE) work bands not only help to study the origin and acceleration mechanism of UHE cosmic rays, but also provide the opportunity to test fundamental physics concepts such as Lorentz symmetry. LHAASO directly observes the $1.42~\mathrm{PeV}$ highest-energy photon. By adopting the synchrotion self-Compton model LHAASO also suggests that the $1.</description>

Gamma-ray burst GRB 211211A may have been the result of a neutron star merger at $\approx350$ Mpc. However, none of the LIGO-Virgo detectors were operating at the time. We show that the gravitational-wave signal from a \grb-like binary neutron star inspiral in the next LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O4) would be below the conventional detection threshold, however a coincident gamma-ray burst observation would provide necessary information to claim a statistically-significant multimessenger observation.</description>

Aims. We wish to establish a firm link between jet simulations and analytical studies of magnetically-driven steady-state jets from Keplerian accretion disks. In particular, the latter have predicted the existence of recollimation shocks due to the dominant hoop-stress, so far never observed in platform simulations. Methods. We perform a set of axisymmetric MHD simulations of non-relativistic jets using the PLUTO code. The simulations are designed to reproduce the boundary conditions generally expected in analytical studies.</description>

We construct a three-dimensional and redshift-evolutionary X-ray and ultraviolet ($L_X-L_{UV}$) luminosity relation for quasars from the powerful statistic tool called copula, and find that the constructed $L_X-L_{UV}$ relation from copula is more viable than the standard one and the observations favor the redshift-evolutionary relation more than $3\sigma$. The Akaike and Bayes information criterions indicate that the quasar data support strongly the three-dimensional $L_X-L_{UV}$ relation. Our results show that the quasars can be regarded as a reliable indicator of the cosmic distance if the $L_X-L_{UV}$ relation from copula is used to calibrate quasar data.</description>

Shell stars, in particular the cooler ones, often do not show conspicuous Balmer-line emission and may consequently be missed in surveys that specifically search for emission signatures in the Halpha line. The present work is aimed at identifying stars with shell-signatures via a search for strong FeII multiplet 42 lines at 4924, 5018, 5169A in archival LAMOST spectra. Candidates were selected by probing the FeII 42 lines in the spectra of a sample of colour-preselected early-type stars using a modified version of the MKCLASS code and then categorised by visual inspection of their spectra.</description>

One of the important discoveries made by Voyager-2 is the nonadiabatic radial profile of the solar wind proton temperature. This phenomenon has been studied for several decades. The dissipation of turbulence energy has been proposed as the main physical process responsible for the temperature profile. The turbulence is both convected with the solar wind and originated in the solar wind by the compressions and shears in the flows and by pick-up ions.</description>

High-precision spectropolarimetric observations are necessary to understand the variability of the Sun. The field of quantitative inference of magnetic field vectors and related solar atmospheric parameters from such observations has long been investigated.</description>

Molecular line observations are powerful tracers of the physical and chemical conditions across the different evolutionary stages of star, disk and planet formation. Using the high angular resolution and unprecedented sensitivity of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) there is now a drive to detect small-scale gas structures in protoplanetary disks that can be attributed directly to forming planets. We report high angular resolution ALMA Band 7 observations of sulphur monoxide (SO) in the nearby planet-hosting disk around Herbig star HD 100546.</description>

Should Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) exist in nature, they would inevitably accrete baryonic matter in their vicinity. In turn, the consequent emission of high-energy radiation could affect the thermal history of the universe to an extent that can be probed with a number of cosmological observables such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. However, our understanding of the accretion and radiation emission processes in the context of PBHs is still in its infancy, and very large theoretical uncertainties affect the resulting constraints on the PBH abundance.</description>

The high-cadence survey of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has completely dominated the discovery of tidal disruption events (TDEs) in the past few years and resulted in the largest sample of TDEs with optical/UV light curves well-sampled around their peaks, providing us an excellent opportunity to construct a peak luminosity function (LF) of tidal disruption flares (TDFs). The new construction is necessary particularly considering that the most updated LF reported in literature has been inferred from only 13 sources from 5 different surveys.</description>

Populating the exoplanet mass-radius diagram in order to identify the underlying relationship that governs planet composition is driving an interdisciplinary effort within the exoplanet community. The discovery of hot super-Earths - a high temperature, short-period subset of the super-Earth planet population - has presented many unresolved questions concerning the formation, evolution, and composition of rocky planets. We report the discovery of a transiting, ultra-short period hot super-Earth orbiting TOI-1075 (TIC 351601843), a nearby ($d$ = 61.</description>

In this study we present the results of a five-year follow-up campaign of the long-lived type IIn supernova SN 2017hcc, found in a spiral dwarf host of near-solar metallicity. The long rise time (57 $\pm$ 2 days, ATLAS $o$ band) and high luminosity (peaking at $-$20.78 $\pm$ 0.01 mag in the ATLAS $o$ band) point towards an interaction of massive ejecta with massive and dense circumstellar material (CSM).</description>

Deriving oxygen abundances from the electron temperature (hereafter the $T_e$-method) is the gold-standard for extragalactic metallicity studies. However, unresolved temperature fluctuations in HII regions can bias metallicity estimates low, with a magnitude that depends on the underlying and typically unknown temperature distribution. Using a toy model, we confirm that computing $T_e$-based metallicities using the temperature derived from the [O III] $\lambda$4363/$\lambda$5007 ratio (&amp;lsquo;ratio temperature&amp;rsquo;; $T_{\rm ratio}$) results in an underprediction of metallicity when temperature fluctuations are present.</description>

      <description>First author: Rahul Yadav
Abrupt and permanent photospheric magnetic field changes have been observed in many flares. It is believed that such changes are related to the reconfiguration of magnetic field lines, however, the real origin is still unclear. In this study we analyze 37 flares to understand the magnetic field vector changes in the photosphere using high-cadence (135 s) vector magnetograms obtained from the HMI/SDO. We also co-align these magnetogram sequences with flare ribbon images (1600 \AA), obtained from the AIA/SDO, to understand how the field change is associated with the ribbon morphology.</description>

The technological progress in spatial-light modulators (SLM) technology has made it possible to use those devices as programmable active focal-plane phase coronagraphic masks, opening the door to novel versatile and adaptive high-contrast imaging observation strategies. However, the scalar nature of the SLM-induced phase response is a potential hurdle when applying the approach to wideband light, as is typical in astronomical imaging. For the first time, we present laboratory results with broadband light (up to ~12pc bandwidth) for two commercially-available SLM devices used as active focal-plane phase masks in the visible regime (640 nm).</description>

In certain cases of astronomical data analysis, the meaningful physical quantity to extract is the ratio $R$ between two data sets. Examples include the lensing ratio, the interloper rate in spectroscopic redshift samples, the decay rate of gravitational potential and $E_G$ to test gravity. However, simply taking the ratio of the two data sets is biased, since it renders (even statistical) errors in the denominator into systematic errors in $R$.</description>

Long-term studies of binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) provide precise tests of strong-field gravity and can be used to measure neutron-star masses. PSR~J1909$-$3744, a binary MSP has been the subject of several pulsar timing analyses. The edge-on orbit enables measurement of its mass using the Shapiro delay; however, there is degeneracy in the sense of the inclination angle, $i$, and multiple solutions for the longitude of ascending node, $\Omega$.</description>

We show that heavy primordial black holes may originate from much lighter ones if the latter are strongly clustered at the time of their formation. While this population is subject to the usual constraints from late-time universe observations, its relation to the initial conditions is different from the standard scenario and provides a new mechanism to generate massive primordial black holes even in the absence of efficient accretion, opening new scenarios, e.</description>

Recent theoretical studies predict that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around low-redshift, $\sim L_{\ast}$ galaxies could have substantial nonthermal pressure support in the form of cosmic rays. However, these predictions are sensitive to the specific model of cosmic-ray transport employed, which is theoretically and observationally underconstrained. In this work, we propose a novel observational constraint for calculating the lower limit of the radially-averaged, effective cosmic-ray transport rate, $\kappa_{\rm min}^{\rm eff}$.</description>

Tensions between cosmological parameters (in particular the local expansion rate $H_0$ and the amplitude of matter clustering $S_8$) inferred from low-redshift data and data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS) experiments have inspired many extensions to the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Models which simultaneously lessen both tensions are of particular interest. We consider one scenario with the potential for such a resolution, in which some fraction of the dark matter has converted into dark radiation since the release of the CMB.</description>

In this work, we use muon bundles which are formed in extensive air showers and detected at the ground level as a tool for searching anisotropy of high energy cosmic rays. Such choice is explained by the penetrating ability of muons which allows them to retain the direction of primary particles with a good accuracy. In 2012-2022, we performed long-term muon bundle detection with the coordinate-tracking detector DECOR, which is a part of the Experimental complex NEVOD (MEPhI, Moscow).</description>

It is currently unknown if neutron stars are composed of nucleons only or are hybrid stars, i.e., in addition to nucleonic crusts and outer cores, they also possess quark cores. Quantum chromodynamics allows for such a phase transition possibility, but accurate calculations in the range of interest for compact stars are still elusive. Here we investigate some crust-breaking aspects of hybrid stars. We show that the crust-breaking orbital/gravitational wave frequency and maximum ellipticity are sensitive to the quark-hadron density jump and equation of state stiffness.</description>

Gas-phase metallicities of galaxies are typically measured through auroral or nebular emission lines, but metallicity also leaves an imprint on the overall spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy and can be estimated through SED fitting. We use the ProSpect SED fitting code with a flexible parametric star formation history and an evolving metallicity history to self-consistently measure metallicities, stellar mass, and other galaxy properties for $\sim90,000$ galaxies from the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) and Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey.</description>

The elemental abundances of planet host stars can shed light on the conditions of planet forming environments. We test if individual abundances of 130 known/candidate planet hosts in APOGEE are statistically different from those of a reference doppelganger sample. The reference set comprises objects selected with the same Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and [Mg/H] as each Kepler Object of Interest (KOI). We predict twelve individual abundances (X = C, N, O, Na, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Ni) for the KOIs and their doppelgangers using a local linear model of these four parameters, training on ASPCAP abundance measurements for a sample of field stars with high fidelity (SNR &amp;gt; 200) APOGEE observations.</description>

Presently, it is broadly assumed that fast radio bursts (FRBs) are sources of coherent emission powered by the magnetic energy release in magnetars. However, the exact emission mechanism is not known, yet. Two main frameworks exist: magnetospheric emission and radiation from external relativistic shocks. In this brief review, I describe basics of both approaches and discuss how they are probed by modern observations.

We have suggested since 2008 and we reconfirm here that UHECR at 40 up to 70 EeV are mostly made by light and lightest nuclei. The remarkable Virgo absence and the few localized nearby extragalactic sources as CenA, NG 253, M82 may be well understood by the lightest nuclei fragility and opacity within Mpc distances.</description>

The diffuse light within galaxy groups and clusters provides valuable insight into the growth of massive cosmic structures. Groups are particularly interesting in this context, because they represent the link between galactic haloes and massive clusters. However, low surface brightness makes their diffuse light extremely challenging to detect individually. Stacking many groups is a promising alternative, but its physical interpretation is complicated by possible systematic variations of diffuse light profiles with other group properties.</description>

I argue that the assumption that the jets that shape the axisymmetrical morphological features of core collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants are post-kick jets, i.e., the neutron star (NS) launches these jets after the explosion and after it acquired its natal kick velocity, leads to the conclusion that the pre-collapse cores of CCSN progenitors have sufficient angular momentum fluctuations to support jittering jets that explode the star.</description>

We study a model of inflation with multiple pseudo-scalar fields coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field through Chern-Simons interactions. Because of parity violating interactions, one polarization of the gauge field is amplified yielding to enhanced curvature perturbation power spectrum. Inflation proceeds in multiple stages as each pseudo-scalar field rolls towards its minimum yielding to distinct multiple peaks in the curvature perturbations power spectrum at various scales during inflation.</description>

We explore how finite integration time or temporal binning can affect the analysis of exoplanet phase-curves. We provide analytical formulae to account for this effect or, if neglected, to estimate the potential biases in the retrieved parameters. As expected, due to their smoother variations over longer time-scales, phase curves can be binned more heavily than transits without causing severe biases. In the simplest case of a sinusoidal phase curve with period $P$, the integration time $\Delta t$ reduces its amplitude by the scaling factor $\text{sinc}{ \left ( \pi \Delta t / P \right ) }$, without altering its phase or shape.</description>

MACS0647$-$JD is a triply-lensed $z\sim11$ galaxy originally discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we report new JWST imaging, which clearly resolves MACS0647$-$JD as having two components that are either merging galaxies or stellar complexes within a single galaxy. Both are very small, with stellar masses $\sim10^8,M_\odot$ and radii $r&amp;lt;100,\rm pc$. The brighter larger component &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; is intrinsically very blue ($\beta\sim-2.6$), likely due to very recent star formation and no dust, and is spatially extended with an effective radius $\sim70,\rm pc$.</description>

      <description>First author: E. S. Jennings
The liquid metal-liquid silicate partitioning of molybdenum and tungsten during core formation must be well-constrained in order to understand the evolution of Earth and other planetary bodies, in particular because the Hf-W isotopic system is used to date early planetary evolution. We combine 48 new high pressure and temperature experimental results with a comprehensive database of previous experiments to re-examine the systematics of Mo and W partitioning.</description>

      <description>First author: Shunke Ai
GRB 221009A is a bright Gamma-ray burst (GRB) with isotropic energy being larger than $10^{54} ~{\rm ergs}$. Its fairly low redshift makes it a promising candidate for high energy neutrino detection. However, a neutrino search for this GRB reported by the \emph{IceCube} collaboration yielded a null result. In this paper, we utilize the upper limit from IceCube observation to test different GRB prompt emission models. We find that, at least for this specific burst, the dissipative photosphere model could be ruled out in a large parameter space.</description>

      <description>First author: Qingyuan Zhang
Annually-resolved measurements of the radiocarbon content in tree-rings have revealed rare sharp rises in carbon-14 production. These &amp;lsquo;Miyake events&amp;rsquo; are likely produced by rare increases in cosmic radiation from the Sun or other energetic astrophysical sources. The radiocarbon produced is not only circulated through the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere and oceans, but also absorbed by the biosphere and locked in the annual growth rings of trees. To interpret high-resolution tree-ring radiocarbon measurements therefore necessitates modelling the entire global carbon cycle.</description>

Electron-positron pair production is the essential process for high-energy gamma-ray astrophysical observations. Following the pioneering OSO-3 counter telescope, the field evolved into use of particle tracking instruments, largely derived from high-energy physics detectors. Although many of the techniques were developed on balloon-borne gamma-ray telescopes, the need to escape the high background in the atmosphere meant that the breakthrough discoveries came from the SAS-2 and COS-B satellites.</description>

The magnetic field is believed to play a critical role in the bulk acceleration and propagation of jets produced in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Polarization observations of AGN jets provide valuable information about their magnetic fields. As a result of radiative transfer, jet structure, and stratification, among other factors, it is not always straightforward to determine the magnetic field structures from observed polarization. We review these effects and their impact on polarization emission at a variety of wavelengths, including radio, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths in this paper.</description>

      <description>First author: Joseph DeRose
Numerical simulations in cosmology require trade-offs between volume, resolution and run-time that limit the volume of the Universe that can be simulated, leading to sample variance in predictions of ensemble-average quantities such as the power spectrum or correlation function(s). Sample variance is particularly acute at large scales, which is also where analytic techniques can be highly reliable. This provides an opportunity to combine analytic and numerical techniques in a principled way to improve the dynamic range and reliability of predictions for clustering statistics.</description>

      <description>First author: Keiichi Maeda
Type Iax Supernovae (SNe Iax) form a class of peculiar SNe Ia, whose early-phase spectra share main spectral line identifications with canonical SNe Ia but with higher ionization and much lower line velocities. Their late-time behaviors deviate from usual SNe Ia in many respects; SNe Iax keep showing photospheric spectra over several 100 days and the luminosity decline is very slow. In the present work, we study the late-time spectra of SN Iax 2019muj including a newly-presented spectrum at ~500 days.</description>

      <description>First author: Kara Merfeld
Magnetars are neutron stars with exceptionally strong dipole magnetic fields which are observed to display a range of x-ray flaring behavior, but the flaring mechanism is not well understood. The third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Virgo extended from April 1, 2019 to March 27, 2020, and contained x-ray flares from known magnetar SGR 1935+2154, as well as the newly-discovered magnetar, Swift J1818-1607. We search for gravitational waves coincident with these magnetar flares with minimally modeled, coherent searches which specifically target both short-duration gravitational waves produced by excited f-modes in the magnetar&amp;rsquo;s core, as well as long-duration gravitational waves motivated by the Quasi-Periodic Oscillations observed in the tails of giant flares.</description>

The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains elusive. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the best candidates able to meet the stringent energy requirements needed for particle acceleration to such high energies. If UHECRs were accelerated by the central engine of GRB 221009A, it might be possible to detect secondary photons and neutrinos as the UHECRs travel from the source to the Earth. Here we attempt to interpret some of the early publicly available data connected to this burst.</description>

The dispersion measure(DM) of fast radio burst encodes important information such as its distance, properties of intervening medium. Based on simulations in the Illustris and IllustrisTNG projects, we analyze the DM of FRBs contributed by the interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium in the hosts, $\rm{DM_{host}}$. We explore two population models - tracing the star formation rate (SFR), and the stellar mass, i.e. young and old progenitors respectively.</description>

HERMES Pathfinder (High Energy Rapid Modular Ensemble of Satellites Pathfinder) is a space mission based on a constellation of nano-satellites in a low Earth Orbit, hosting new miniaturized detectors to probe the X-ray temporal emission of bright high-energy transients such as Gamma-Ray Bursts and the electromagnetic counterparts of Gravitational Waves. This ambitious goal will be achieved exploiting at most Commercial offthe-shelf components. For HERMES-SP, a custom Power Supply Unit board has been designed to supply the needed voltages to the payload and, at the same time, protecting it from Latch-Up events.</description>

We analyze the stellar abundances of massive galaxies ($\log M_\ast/M_\odot&amp;gt;10.5$) at $z=2$ in the IllustrisTNG simulation with the goal of guiding the interpretation of current and future observations, particularly from the James Webb Space Telescope. We find that the effective size, $R_e$, of galaxies strongly affects the abundance measurements: both [Mg/H] and [Fe/H] are anti-correlated with $R_e$, while the relative abundance [Mg/Fe] slightly increases with $R_e$.</description>

High-dimensional data sets are expected from the next generation of large-scale surveys. These data sets will carry a wealth of information about the early stages of galaxy formation and cosmic reionization. Extracting the maximum amount of information from the these data sets remains a key challenge. Current simulations of cosmic reionization are computationally too expensive to provide enough realizations to enable testing different statistical methods, such as parameter inference.</description>

Fallback supernovae and the collapsar scenario for long-gamma ray burst and hypernovae have received considerable interest as pathways to black-hole formation and extreme transient events. Consistent simulations of these scenarios require a general relativistic treatment and need to deal appropriately with the formation of a singularity. Free evolution schemes for the Einstein equations can handle the formation of black holes by means of excision or puncture schemes.</description>

Over 150 resolved, kpc-scale X-ray jets hosted by active galactic nuclei have been discovered with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. A significant fraction of these jets have an X-ray spectrum either too high in flux or too hard to be consistent with the high-energy extension of the radio-to-optical synchrotron spectrum, a subtype we identify as Multiple Spectral Component (MSC) X-ray jets. A leading hypothesis for the origin of the X-rays is the inverse-Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background by the same electron population producing the radio-to-optical synchrotron spectrum (known as the IC/CMB model).</description>

We report the detection of a long-timescale negative lag, where the blue bands lag the red bands, in the nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy Fairall 9. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) light curves show variability over a wide range of timescales. By measuring time lags between different wavelengths, the otherwise inaccessible structure and kinematics of the accretion disk can be studied. One common approach, reverberation mapping, quantifies the continuum and line lags moving outwards through the disk at the light-travel time, revealing the size and temperature profile of the disk.</description>

An accurate calibration of the source redshift distribution $p(z)$ is a key aspect in the analysis of cosmic shear data. This, one way or another, requires the use of spectroscopic or high-quality photometric samples. However, the difficulty to obtain colour-complete spectroscopic samples matching the depth of weak lensing catalogs means that the analyses of different cosmic shear datasets often use the same samples for redshift calibration.</description>

We study the luminous blue variable candidate J004229.87+410551.8 in the Andromeda Galaxy.

Subsequently the star was assumed to be a hot hypergiant or a B[e] supergiant. For the purpose of clear star classification, we conducted spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the object and its surroundings with the 6-m telescope of SAO RAS, the 3.</description>

Gaseous outflows are key phenomena in the evolution of galaxies, as they affect star formation (either positively or negatively), eject gas from the core or disk, and directly cause mixing of pristine and processed material. Active outflows may be detected through searches for broad spectral line emission or high-velocity gas, but it is also possible to determine the presence of past outflows by searching for extended reservoirs of chemically enriched molecular gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxies.</description>

The GRB 190829A has been widely studied due to its nature and the high energy emission presented. Due to the detection of a very-high-energy component by the High Energy Stereoscopic System and the event&amp;rsquo;s atypically middling luminosity, it has been categorized in a select, limited group of bursts bordering classic GRBs and nearby sub-energetic events. Given the range of models utilized to adequately characterize the afterglow of this burst, it has proven challenging to identify the most probable explanation.</description>

Photometric investigations have revealed that Galactic globular clusters exhibit internal metallicity variations amongst the so-called first-population stars, until now considered to have a homogeneous initial chemical composition. This is not fully supported by the sparse spectroscopic evidence, which so far gives conflicting results. Here, we present a high-resolution re-analysis of five stars in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 2808 taken from the literature. Target stars are bright red giants with nearly identical atmospheric parameters belonging to the first population according to their identification in the chromosome map of the cluster, and we have measured precise differential abundances for Fe, Si, Ca, Ti, and Ni to the ~0.</description>

Interesting discrepancies in cosmological parameters are challenging the success of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Direct measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ using Cepheid variables and supernovae turn out to be higher than inferred from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Weak galaxy lensing surveys consistently report values of the strength of matter clustering $\sigma_8$ lower than values derived from the CMB in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. In this paper we address these discrepancies in cosmological parameters by considering Dark Energy (DE) as a fluid with evolving equation of state $w_{\mathrm{de}}(z)$, constant sound speed squared $\hat{c}{\mathrm{s}}^{2}$, and vanishing anisotropic stress $\sigma$.</description>

      <description>First author: David Garofalo
Jet re-orientation associated with the time evolution of radio quasars explains the formation of X-shaped radio galaxies and their preference for isolated environments. But since X-shaped radio galaxies are generally not found in dense environments (e.g. groups/clusters), the jet re-orientation phenomenon for radio galaxies in groups and clusters has been ignored. We take a closer look at the re-orientation of FRI jets with respect to FRII jets, and find that it may constitute the as-yet unidentified trigger for star formation suppression in radio galaxies.</description>

Context. About 0.2-2% of giant stars are Li-rich, whose lithium abundance (A(Li)) is higher than 1.5 dex. Among them, near 6% are super Li-rich with A(Li) exceeding 3.2 dex. Meanwhile, the formation mechanism of these Li-rich and super Li-rich giants is still under debate. Aims. Considering the compact He core of red giants, attention is paid to the effect of element diffusion on A(Li). In particular, when the He core flash occurs, the element diffusion makes the thermohaline mixing zone extend inward and connect to the inner convection region of stars.</description>

The 1.3deg (G1.3) and 1.6deg (G1.6) cloud complexes in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy have been proposed to possibly reside at the intersection region of the X1 and X2 orbits for several reasons. This includes the detection of co-spatial low- and high-velocity clouds, high velocity dispersion, high fractional molecular abundances of shock-tracing molecules, and kinetic temperatures that are higher than for usual CMZ clouds.</description>

The fast evolving TeV-PeV transients and their delayed GeV-TeV cascade emission in principle server as an ideal probe of the inter-galactic magnetic fields which are hard to be measured by other methods. Very recently, LHASSO has detected the very high energy emission of the extraordinary powerful GRB 221009A up to $\sim 18$ TeV within $\sim 2000$ s after the burst trigger. Here we report the detection of a $\sim 400$ GeV photon, without accompanying prominent $\gamma$ rays down to $\sim 2$ GeV, by Fermi-LAT in the direction of GRB 221009A at about 0.</description>

General relativity predicts that images of optically thin accretion flows around black holes should generically have a photon ring,&#39;&#39; composed of a series of increasingly sharp subrings that correspond to increasingly strongly lensed emission near the black hole. Because the effects of lensing are determined by the spacetime curvature, the photon ring provides a pathway to precise measurements of the black hole properties and tests of the Kerr metric.</description>

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M 87 provided the first image of the accretion environment on horizon scales. General relativity predicts that the image of the shadow should be nearly circular, given the inclination angle of the black hole M 87*. A robust detection of ellipticity in the image reconstructions of M 87* could signal new gravitational physics on horizon scales.</description>

Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves provides a potential new probe of dark matter structures. In this work, we consider the microlensing effect on gravitational wave signals from black hole binaries induced by low-mass dark matter halos that do not retain enough baryonic matter to hold stars. We clarify systematically when this microlensing effect is relevant and study in detail its detectability by future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

Magnetospheres of neutron stars can be perturbed by star quakes or interaction in a binary system. The perturbations are typically in the kHz band and excite magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. We show that compressive magnetospheric waves steepen into monster shocks mediated by radiation reaction, different from normal collisionless shocks. The shocks admit a simple analytical description. They expand through the magnetosphere with radiative losses, and then a blast wave is launched into the neutron-star wind.</description>

      <description>First author: Saeed Fakhry
Cosmic voids are known as underdense substructures of the cosmic web that cover a large volume of the Universe. It is known that cosmic voids contain a small number of dark matter halos, so the existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) in these secluded regions of the Universe is not unlikely. In this work, we calculate the merger rate of PBHs in dark matter halos structured in cosmic voids and determine their contribution to gravitational wave events resulting from black hole mergers recorded by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO)-Advanced Virgo (aVirgo) detectors.</description>

      <description>First author: Simon Chiche
Radio-detection is a mature technique that has gained large momentum over the past decades. Its physical detection principle is mainly driven by the electromagnetic part of the shower, and is therefore not too sensitive to uncertainties on hadronic interactions. Furthermore its technical detection principle allows for a 100% duty cycle, and large surface coverage thanks to the low cost of antennas. Various detection methods of UHE particles now rely on the radio signal as main observable.</description>

This paper presents a polarization calibration method applied to a microwave polarimeter demonstrator based on a near-infrared (NIR) frequency up-conversion stage that allows both optical correlation and signal detection at a wavelength of 1550 nm. The instrument was designed to measure the polarization of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation from the sky, obtaining the Stokes parameters of the incoming signal simultaneously, in a frequency range from 10 to 20 GHz.</description>

We apply 3D hydrodynamical simulations to study the rotational aspect of gas flow patterns around eccentric companions embedded in an accretion disk around its primary host. We sample a wide range of companion mass ratio q and disk aspect ratio h, and confirm a generic transition from prograde (steady tidal interaction dominated) to retrograde (background Keplerian shear dominated) circum-companion flow when orbital eccentricity exceeds a critical value et.</description>

We study the propagation of a strong, low frequency, linearly polarized fast magnetosonic wave inside the magnetosphere of a neutron star. The relative strength $\delta B/B$ of the wave grows as a function of radius before it reaches the light cylinder, and what starts as a small perturbation can grow to become nonlinear before it escapes the magnetosphere. Using first-principles Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, we study in detail the evolution of the wave as it becomes nonlinear.</description>

Generally the dynamical state of superclusters is poorly known.

We extracted our supercluster sample with an adaptive local threshold density method from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) data and estimated their masses using the dynamical masses for member galaxies and groups.</description>

Several attempts to detect extensive air showers (EAS) induced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays have been conducted in the last decade based on the molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation (MBR) at GHz frequencies from quasi-elastic collisions of ionisation electrons left in the atmosphere after the passage of the cascade of particles. These attempts have led to the detection of a handful of signals only, all of them forward-directed along the shower axis and hence suggestive of originating from geomagnetic and Askaryan emissions extending into GHz frequencies close to the Cherenkov angle.</description>

The luminosity of the Soft Gamma Repeater (SGR) flares significantly exceeds the Eddington luminosity. This is because they emit mainly in the E-mode, for which the radiative cross-sections are strongly suppressed. The energy is released in the magnetosphere forming a magnetically trapped pair fireball, and the surface of the star is illuminated by the powerful radiation from the fireball. We study the ablation of the matter from the surface by this radiation.</description>

Neutrinos associated with solar flares (solar-flare neutrinos) provide information on particle acceleration mechanisms during the impulsive phase of solar flares. We searched using the Super-Kamiokande detector for neutrinos from solar flares that occurred during solar cycles $23$ and $24$, including the largest solar flare (X28.0) on November 4th, 2003. In order to minimize the background rate we searched for neutrino interactions within narrow time windows coincident with $\gamma$-rays and soft X-rays recorded by satellites.</description>

The results are compared to the current capabilities of ALMA. ALMA can detect the integrated emission, and determine the velocity gradient and size across the brighter emission regions of the galaxy. The ngVLA is a factor $\sim 6$ more sensitive at the adopted spatial and velocity resolution.</description>

We then study how the anisotropy of synchrotron total and polarization intensities arising from three fundamental MHD modes vary with the viewing angle, i.</description>

AI super-resolution, combining deep learning and N-body simulations has been shown to successfully reproduce the large scale structure and halo abundances in the Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmological model. Here, we extend its use to models with a different dark matter content, in this case Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), in the approximation that the difference is encoded in the initial power spectrum. We focus on redshift z = 2, with simulations that model smaller scales and lower masses, the latter by two orders of magnitude, than has been done in previous AI super-resolution work.</description>

Dwarf galaxies are ideal laboratories to study the relationship between the environment and AGN activity. However, the type of environments in which dwarf galaxies hosting AGN reside is still unclear and limited to low-redshift studies (z &amp;lt; 0.5). We use the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) to investigate, for the first time, their environments at 0.5 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.9. We select a sample of 12,942 low-mass ($\rm{log}(M_\mathrm{*}/M_{\odot})\leq10$) galaxies and use the emission-line diagnostic diagram to identify AGN.</description>

In this work we address the issue of whether the division of clusters in cool cores (CCs) and non-cool cores (NCCs) is due to a primordial difference or to how clusters evolve across cosmic time. Our first goal is to establish if spectra from the central regions of a subclass of NCCs known as cool core remnants (CCRs) are consistent with having a small but significant amount of short cooling time gas, thereby allowing a transformation to CC systems on a timescale of a giga year.</description>

Our study includes the earliest generations of stars and the protogalaxies ($10^6 \lesssim M_v/M_\odot \lesssim 10^8$) containing them. We compare results obtained with the new methods to two common paradigms of metallicity initial conditions in simulations: ignoring the metallicity initial condition and assuming a uniform metallicity floor.</description>

      <description>First author: Peter Garnavich
FO Aqr is a bright intermediate polar that has long displayed large amplitude photometric variations corresponding to the 20.9 min spin period of its white dwarf. Between 2016 and 2020, the system suffered a series of unprecedented low-states, but recent data shows that it has now recovered to its normal optical luminosity. We compare the light curves obtained by K2/Kepler in 2014 with photometry from the TESS mission obtained in 2021.</description>

      <description>First author: Darius Modirrousta-Galian
A significant fraction of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are thought to experience an extreme loss of volatiles because of atmospheric evaporation in the early stages of their life. Though the mechanisms behind the extreme mass loss are not fully understood, two contenders have been widely discussed: photoevaporation from X-ray and ultraviolet irradiation and core powered mass loss. Here, it is shown that both mechanisms occur but with different timescales, and that atmospheric loss can take place over three regimes.</description>

The brightest long gamma-ray burst detected so far by the Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM telescopes, GRB~221009A provides an unprecedented opportunity for understanding the high-energy processes in extreme transient phenomena. We find that the conventional leptonic models, synchrotron and synchrotron-self-Compton, for the afterglow emission from this source is unable to explain observation of $\gamma$ rays, by the LHAASO detector, extending up to 18 TeV energies. We model $\gamma$-ray spectrum estimated in the energy range 0.</description>

      <description>First author: P B Jones
The growth of a longitudinal or quasi-longitudinal Langmuir mode in the outward-moving beam of ions and protons that forms the open sector of an ion-proton pulsar magnetosphere radiates as an analogue of an end-fed high-impedance horizontal straight-wire antenna an integral number of half-waves in length. The radiation has, broadly, the energy flux, linear polarization and spectral index that are widely observed: also, the notch phenomenon seen in some integrated pulse profiles occurs naturally.</description>

Extracting the non-Gaussian information encoded in the higher-order clustering statistics of the large-scale structure is key to fully realizing the potential of upcoming galaxy surveys. We investigate the information content of the redshift-space {\it weighted skew spectra} of biased tracers as efficient estimators for 3-point clustering statistics. The skew spectra are constructed by correlating the observed galaxy field with an appropriately-weighted square of it. We perform numerical Fisher forecasts using two synthetic datasets; the halo catalogs from the Quijote N-body simulations and the galaxy catalogs from the Molino suite.</description>

We introduce the first complete non-parametric model for the astrophysical distribution of the binary black hole (BBH) population. Constructed from basis splines, we use these models to conduct the most comprehensive data-driven investigation of the BBH population to date, simultaneously fitting non-parametric models for the BBH mass ratio, spin magnitude and misalignment, and redshift distributions for the first time. Using the BBHs in GWTC-3, we report the same features recovered with similarly flexible models of the mass distribution, most notably the peaks in merger rates at primary masses of ${\sim}10,M_\odot$ and ${\sim}35,M_\odot$.</description>

We perform cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, including and excluding streaming velocities, in regions centered on halos with $M_{\rm vir}(z=0) \approx 10^{10}$ M${\odot}$; the simulations are part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project and run with FIRE-3 physics.</description>

      <description>First author: Nikita Kramarev
We consider the gas dynamics in an accreting binary system of degenerate stars within the framework of the Newtonian approximation. In such a system, the accretion stream can impact the surface of a white dwarf (WD) or neutron star (NS) as a result of the very compact orbit. This causes a loss of angular momentumfrom the orbit and spin-up of the accretor. We construct approximations for the specific angular momentum of the accreting matter which goes to spin up the accretor and some other parameters of the system.</description>

The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, a key mission in multiwavelength and multimessenger studies, has been surveying the gamma-ray sky from its low-Earth orbit since 2008. Its two scientific instruments, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and the Large Area Telescope (LAT), cover 8 orders of magnitude in photon energy. The GBM consists of 12 Sodium Iodide detectors and 2 Bismuth Germinate detectors, covering the 10 keV - 40 MeV energy range, arrayed on two sides of the spacecraft so as to view the entire sky that is not occulted by the Earth.</description>

      <description>First author: Rafael Alves Batista
Recently an extraordinarily bright gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A, was observed by several facilities covering the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays with energies up to 18 TeV were detected, as well as a photon with 251 TeV. Such energetic events are not expected because they would be attenuated by pair-production interactions with the extragalactic background light. This tension is, however, only apparent, and does not call for any unconventional explanation.</description>

We individually used both the quiescent and the two VHE flaring phases around IC170922-A and additionally, the 2014 neutrino flare phase for the source to study the ALP effect at sub-PeV energies.

Context. Planets around stars in the solar neighbourhood will be prime targets for characterisation with upcoming large space- and ground-based facilities. Since large-scale exoplanet searches will not be feasible with such telescopes, it is crucial to use currently available data and instruments to find possible target planets before next generation facilities come online. Aims. We aim at detecting new extrasolar planets around stars in the solar neighbourhood by blind radial velocity (RV) search with ESPRESSO.</description>

We present total-intensity and polarized-intensity images of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant (SNR) observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The high angular-resolution and high-sensitivity images enable us to thoroughly compare the properties of the northern part with the southern part of the SNR. The central filament in the northern part and the southern part have a similar foreground rotation measure, meaning their distances are likely similar.</description>

To reach the full potential of the new generation of ground based telescopes, an extremely fine adjustment of the phase is required. Wavefront control and correction before detection has therefore become one of the cornerstones of instruments to achieve targeted performance, especially for high-contrast imaging. A crucial feature of accurate wavefront control leans on the wavefront sensor (WFS). We present a strategy to design new Fourier-Filtering WFS that encode the phase close from the fundamental photon efficiency limit.</description>

We search for a spatial association between radio pulsars and ultra-high energy neutrinos using the publicly available IceCube point source neutrino events catalog. For this purpose we use the unbinned maximum likelihood method to search for a statistically significant excess from each of the pulsars in the ATNF catalog. We do not find any pulsars with detection significance much higher than that expected from a Gaussian distribution, Therefore, we conclude that none of the currently known pulsars contribute to the diffuse neutrino flux detected by IceCube.</description>

The continuum level is a non-detection in the HETDEX spectrum, thus the measured EW is a lower limit. The source is detected with significant emission lines (&amp;gt;7sigma) at LyA+NV, CIV, and moderate emission line (~4sigma) at HeII within the wavelength coverage of HETDEX (3500 AA - 5500 AA).</description>

We analyse 8 epochs of high-resolution spectra obtained with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at optical wavelengths, targeting orbital phases when the day-side is in view. We use a cross-correlation method to search for various atoms, TiO and VO and compare to models.</description>

We simulate the propagation and dissipation of tidally induced nonlinear gravity waves in the cores of solar-type stars. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a previously developed Boussinesq model using a spectral-element code to study the stellar core as a wave cavity that is periodically forced at the outer boundary with a given azimuthal wavenumber and an adjustable frequency. For low-amplitude forcing, the system exhibits resonances with standing g-modes at particular frequencies, corresponding to a situation in which the tidal torque is highly frequency-dependent.</description>

The tomographic Alcock-Paczynski (AP) method is a promising method that uses the redshift evolution of the anisotropic clustering in redshift space to calibrate cosmology. It extends the applicable range of AP method to substantially nonlinear scales, yielding very tight cosmological constraints. For future stage-IV slitless spectroscopic surveys, the non-negligible redshift errors might reduce the advantage of the tomographic AP method by suppressing the resolution of the nonlinear structure along the line of sight.</description>

Interstellar (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxies are linked to several physical processes that drive galaxy evolution. For example, the X-ray emission from the CGM gas around ellipticals has been linked to the AGN feedback occurring in the host. Upcoming telescopes such as HUBS, with ~ 1 eV resolution, can provide us with deep insights about the hot gas properties of such galaxies thus constrain these processes.</description>

Our goal is to determine, with high accuracy, the physical and orbital parameters of two double-lined eclipsing binary systems, where the components are two giant stars. We also aim to study the evolutionary status of the binaries, to derive the distances towards them by using a surface brightness-colour relation, and to compare these measurements with the measurements presented by the Gaia mission. In order to measure the physical and orbital parameters of the systems, we analysed the light curves and radial-velocity curves with the Wilson-Devinney code.</description>

The rotation-vibration-electronic (rovibronic) line lists, named \texttt{XAB}, consider transitions involving the \X, \A, and \BBp\ electronic states in the 0&amp;ndash;30,000~cm$^{-1}$ region (wavelengths $\lambda &amp;gt; 0.33$~$\mu$m) and are suitable for temperatures up to 5000 K. A comprehensive analysis of the published spectroscopic literature on CaH and MgH is used to obtain new extensive datasets of accurate rovibronic energy levels with measurement uncertainties and consistent quantum number labelling.</description>

Any future detection of the calcium monohydroxide radical (CaOH) in stellar and exoplanetary atmospheres will rely on accurate molecular opacity data. Here, we present the first comprehensive molecular line list of CaOH covering the \A&amp;ndash;\X\ rotation-vibration-electronic and \X&amp;ndash;\X\ rotation-vibration bands. The newly computed OYT6 line list contains over 24.2 billion transitions between 3.2 million energy levels with rotational excitation up to $J=175.5$. It is applicable to temperatures up to $T=3000$~K and covers the 0,&amp;ndash;,35,000~cm$^{-1}$ range (wavelengths $\lambda &amp;gt; 0.</description>

The recent flight experiments with Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\textit{NICER}) and \textit{Insight}-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (\textit{Insight}-HXMT) have demonstrated the feasibility of X-ray pulsar-based navigation (XNAV) in the space. However, the current pulse phase estimation and navigation methods employed in the above flight experiments are computationally too expensive for handling the Crab pulsar data. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fast algorithm of on-orbit estimating the pulse phase of Crab pulsar called X-ray pulsar navigaTion usIng on-orbiT pulsAr timiNg (XTITAN).</description>

      <description>First author: Patrick Hennebelle
In spite of decades of theoretical efforts, the physical origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is still debated. We aim at understanding the influence of various physical processes such as radiative stellar feedback, magnetic field and non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamics on the IMF. We present a series of numerical simulations of collapsing 1000 M$\odot$ clumps taking into account radiative feedback and magnetic field with spatial resolution down to 1 AU.</description>

      <description>First author: Olivier Absil
The high-speed variability of the local water vapor content in the Earth atmosphere is a significant contributor to ground-based wavefront quality throughout the infrared domain. Unlike dry air, water vapor is highly chromatic, especially in the mid-infrared. This means that adaptive optics correction in the visible or near-infrared domain does not necessarily ensure a high wavefront quality at longer wavelengths. Here, we use literature measurements of water vapor seeing, and more recent infrared interferometric data from the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), to evaluate the wavefront quality that will be delivered to the METIS mid-infrared camera and spectrograph for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), operating from 3 to 13 {\mu}m, after single-conjugate adaptive optics correction in the near-infrared.</description>

Mid-Infrared (IR) silicate dust bands observed in heavily obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) include information on the mineralogical properties of silicate dust. We aim to investigate the mineralogical picture of the circumnuclear region of heavily obscured AGNs to reveal obscured AGN activities through the picture. In our previous study Tsuchikawa et al. (2021), we investigated the properties of silicate dust in heavily obscured AGNs focusing on the mineralogical composition and the crystallinity with Spitzer/IRS 5.</description>

      <description>First author: Weicheng Zang
We present the analysis of seven microlensing planetary events with planet/host mass ratios $q &amp;lt; 10^{-4}$: KMT-2017-BLG-1194, KMT-2017-BLG-0428, KMT-2019-BLG-1806, KMT-2017-BLG-1003, KMT-2019-BLG-1367, OGLE-2017-BLG-1806, and KMT-2016-BLG-1105. They were identified by applying the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) AnomalyFinder algorithm to 2016&amp;ndash;2019 KMTNet events. A Bayesian analysis indicates that all the lens systems consist of a cold super-Earth orbiting an M or K dwarf. Together with 17 previously published and three that will be published elsewhere, AnomalyFinder has found a total of 27 planets that have solutions with $q &amp;lt; 10^{-4}$ from 2016&amp;ndash;2019 KMTNet events, which lays the foundation for the first statistical analysis of the planetary mass-ratio function based on KMTNet data.</description>

The WALLABY pilot survey has been conducted using the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP). The integrated 21-cm HI line spectra are formed in a very different manner compared to usual single-dish spectra Tully-Fisher measurements. It is thus extremely important to ensure that slight differences (e.g. biases due to missing flux) are quantified and understood in order to maximise the use of the large amount of data becoming available soon.</description>

Contemporary radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the AGNs predicts presence of the hot and strong accretion disk wind, which gets unstable far from the central region and turns into gas clumps. These inner-wind and outer clumps may be actually observed as the ultrafast outflows (UFOs) and the clumpy absorbers, respectively. We may call this picture as the &amp;ldquo;hot inner and clumpy outer wind model&amp;rdquo;. Observationally, it is challenging to place constraints on the origin of the UFOs and clumpy absorbers due to complicated spectral variations.</description>

We present Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the young, gas-rich debris disk around HD110058 at 0.3-0.6\arcsec resolution. The disk is detected in the 0.85 and 1.3~mm continuum, as well as in the J=2-1 and J=3-2 transitions of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO. The observations resolve the dust and gas distributions and reveal that this is the smallest debris disk around stars of similar luminosity observed by ALMA.</description>

It is commonly accepted that radio-loud active galactic nuclei are hosted exclusively by giant elliptical galaxies. We analyze high-resolution optical Hubble Space Telescope images of a sample of radio galaxies with extended double-lobed structures associated with disk-like optical counterparts. After systematically evaluating the probability of chance alignment between the radio lobes and the optical counterparts, we obtain a sample of 18 objects likely to have genuine associations.</description>

Strong gravitational lenses allow us to peer into the farthest reaches of space by bending the light from a background object around a massive object in the foreground. Unfortunately, these lenses are extremely rare, and manually finding them in astronomy surveys is difficult and time-consuming. We are thus tasked with finding them in an automated fashion with few if any, known lenses to form positive samples.</description>

      <description>First author: Ross J. Jennings
The millisecond pulsar J1713+0747 underwent a sudden and significant pulse shape change between April 16 and 17, 2021 (MJDs 59320 and 59321). Subsequently, the pulse shape gradually recovered over the course of several months. We report the results of continued multi-frequency radio observations of the pulsar made using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in a two-year period encompassing the shape change event, between February 2020 and March 2022.</description>

We study the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies and how they suppress star formation and maintain it quenched. A one-zone chemical model which follows in detail the time evolution of gas mass and its chemical abundances during the active and passive evolution, is adopted. The model includes both gas infall and outflow as well as detailed stellar nucleosynthesis. Elliptical galaxies with different infall masses, following a down-sizing in star formation scenario, are considered.</description>

We present core-collapse supernovae simulations including nuclear reaction networks which impact explosion dynamics and nucleosynthesis. The different composition treatment can lead to changes in the neutrino heating in the vicinity of the shock, by modifying the amount of nucleons and thus the $\mathrm{\nu}$-opacity of the region. This reduces the ram pressure outside the shock and allows an easier expansion. The energy released by the nuclear reactions during collapse also slows down the accretion, and aids the shock expansion.</description>

Here, we demonstrate that polarization properties show a wide diversity depending on viewing angles. To simulate images of a supermassive black hole and surrounding plasma, we performed a full-polarimetric general relativistic radiative transfer based on three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models with moderate magnetic strengths. Under an assumption of a hot-jet and cold-disk in the electron temperature prescription, we confirmed a typical scenario where polarized synchrotron emissions from the funnel jet experience Faraday rotation and conversion in the equatorial disk.</description>

GraphNeT is an open-source python framework aimed at providing high quality, user friendly, end-to-end functionality to perform reconstruction tasks at neutrino telescopes using graph neural networks (GNNs). GraphNeT makes it fast and easy to train complex models that can provide event reconstruction with state-of-the-art performance, for arbitrary detector configurations, with inference times that are orders of magnitude faster than traditional reconstruction techniques. GNNs from GraphNeT are flexible enough to be applied to data from all neutrino telescopes, including future projects such as IceCube extensions or P-ONE.</description>

Nearby M dwarf systems currently offer the most favorable opportunities for spectroscopic investigations of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres. The LTT~1445 system is a hierarchical triple of M dwarfs with two known planets orbiting the primary star, LTT~1445A. We observe four transits of the terrestrial world LTT~1445Ab ($R=1.3$ R$\oplus$, $M=2.9$ M$\oplus$) at low resolution with Magellan II/LDSS3C. We use the combined flux of the LTT~1445BC pair as a comparison star, marking the first time that an M dwarf is used to remove telluric variability from time-series observations of another M dwarf.</description>

We detect a planet candidate with a period of $24.421^{+0.016}{-0.017}$ days around HD79211 in these HARPS-N RVs, validating the planet candidate originally identified in CARMENES RV data alone. Using HARPS-N, CARMENES and HIRES RVs spanning a total of 25 years, we further refine the planet candidate parameters to $P=24.</description>

We present optical photometric and spectroscopic analysis of a Type Iax supernova (SN) 2020rea situated at the brighter luminosity end of Type Iax supernovae (SNe). The light curve decline rate of SN~2020rea is $\Delta$m${15}$(g) = 1.31$\pm$0.08 mag which is similar to SNe 2012Z and 2005hk. Modelling the pseudo bolometric light curve with a radiation diffusion model yields a mass of $^{56}$Ni of 0.13$\pm$0.01 M${\odot}$ and an ejecta mass of 0.</description>

Hot Jupiters (HJs) are giant planets with orbital periods of the order of a few days with semimajor axis within $\sim$0.1 au. Several theories have been invoked in order to explain the origin of this type of planets, one of them being the high-eccentricity migration. This migration can occur through different high-eccentricity mechanisms. Our investigation focused on six different kinds of high-eccentricity mechanisms, namely, direct dispersion, coplanar, Kozai-Lidov, secular chaos, E1 and E2 mechanisms.</description>

We report on observations of highly-varying Si IV 1402.77 line profiles observed with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) during the M-class flare from 2022 January 18 at an unprecedented 0.8 s cadence. Moment analysis of this line observed in flare ribbon kernels showed that the intensity, Doppler velocity, and non-thermal broadening exhibited variations with periods below 10 s. These variations were found to be correlated with properties of the Gaussian fit to a well-resolved secondary component of the line redshifted by up to 70 km s$^{-1}$, while the primary component was consistently observed near the rest wavelength of the line.</description>

      <description>First author: Jacob Golomb
The spins of black holes in merging binaries can reveal information related to the formation and evolution of these systems. Combining events to infer the astrophysical distribution of black hole spins allows us to determine the relative contribution from different formation scenarios to the population. Many previous works have modeled spin population distributions using parametric models. While these are valuable approaches when the observed population is small, they make strong assumptions about the shape of the underlying distribution and are highly susceptible to biases due to mismodeling.</description>

      <description>First author: R. A. J. Eyles-Ferris
We present simulated optical light curves of super-Eddington tidal disruption events (TDEs) using the zero-Bernoulli accretion (ZEBRA) flow model, which proposes that during the super-Eddington phase, the disc is quasi-spherical, radiation-pressure dominated, and accompanied by the production of strong jets. We construct light curves for both on- and off-axis (with respect to the jet) observers to account for the anisotropic nature of the jetted emission.</description>

      <description>First author: Ankita Bera
In this review article, we briefly outline our current understanding of the physics associated with the HI 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn. We discuss different phases of cosmic dawn as the ambient gas and the background radiations evolve with the redshift. We address the consequences of several possible heating sources and radiation background on the global 21-cm signal. We further review our present perspective of other important aspects of the HI 21-cm signal such as the power spectrum and imaging.</description>

      <description>First author: Debasish Saha
We study different timing and spectral properties of the new Galactic X-ray transient Swift J1728.9-3613 using NICER and Swift, discovered by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The source went through multiple transitions to different spectral states during the outburst, and the complete evolution created a q-shaped track in the hardness intensity diagram. A partial hysteresis is also observed in the RMS-intensity diagram, which is another well-defined phenomenon of black hole transients.</description>

      <description>First author: Isabela S. Matos
Gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by binary sources are interesting signals for testing gravity on cosmological scales since they allow measurements of the luminosity distance. When followed by electromagnetic counterparts, in particular, they enable a reconstruction of the GW-distance-redshift relation. In the context of several modified gravity (MG) theories, even when requiring that the speed of propagation is equal to that of light, this GW distance differs from the standard electromagnetic luminosity distance due to the presence of a modified friction in the GW propagation.</description>

      <title>The impact of spin-kick alignment on the inferred velocity distribution of isolated pulsars</title>

      <description>First author: Ilya Mandel
The speeds of isolated pulsars are generally inferred from their observed 2-d velocities on the plane of the sky under the assumption that the unobserved radial velocity is not special, i.e., that the measured 2-d velocity is an isotropic projection of the full 3-d velocity. However, if pulsar spins are preferentially aligned with kicks, then the observer&amp;rsquo;s location is in fact special because the direction of the spin impacts the detectability of the pulsar.</description>

      <description>First author: Elspeth K. H. Lee
The atmospheres of ultra hot Jupiters (UHJs) are prime targets for the detection of molecules and atoms at both low and high spectral resolution. We study the atmospheres of the UHJs WASP-121b and WASP-189b by performing 3D general circulation models (GCMs) of these planets using high temperature correlated-k opacity schemes with ultra-violet (UV) absorbing species included. The GCM results are then post-processed at low and high spectral resolutions and compared to available data.</description>

We present the average rest-frame spectrum of the final catalog of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected from the South Pole Telescope SZ survey (SPT-SZ) and measured with Band 3 of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This work builds on the previous average rest-frame spectrum, given in Spilker et al. 2014 for the first 22 sources, and is comprised of a total of 78 sources, normalized by their respective dust masses.</description>

      <description>First author: Jake A. J. Mitchell
We use the SOUX sample of $\sim$700 AGN to form average optical-UV-X-rays SEDs on a 2D grid of $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ and $L_{2500}$. We compare these with the predictions of a new AGN SED model, QSOSED, which includes prescriptions for both hot and warm Comptonisation regions as well as an outer standard disc. This predicts the overall SED fairly well for 7.5&amp;lt;log($M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$)&amp;lt;9.0 over a wide range in $L/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$, but at higher masses the outer disc spectra in the model are far too cool to match the data.</description>

Hierarchical Bayesian inference is an essential tool for studying the population properties of compact binaries with gravitational waves. The basic premise is to infer the unknown prior distribution of binary black hole and/or neutron star parameters such component masses, spin vectors, and redshift. These distributions shed light on the fate of massive stars, how and where binaries are assembled, and the evolution of the Universe over cosmic time.</description>
